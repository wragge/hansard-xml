I made further inquiries, and I am now informed that the letters in question have been received, and that they had been received at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> first asked the question. I can only express my regret and annoyance that, quite innocently,  1  gave the Senate misleading information supplied by one of the Departments. I have made the necessary arrangements to have copies of the letters prepared for honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>- By leave of the Senate, I wish to make a personal explanation. When a division was being taken last night, I was making some remarks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> said something which I took to be a reflection upon my regard for the truth. I do not think that the honorable senator meant what he said in that way, but I took it in that way at the moment, and made a very sharp reply, in which I used an expression which I ought not to have used. I am very sorry that I used it, and I apologize to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> for having done so. </para>

                        <para>. - In addressing myself to this Bill I wish to say as briefly as possible that I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made out avery good case indeed for the inquiry asked for in his amendment. It has to be remembered that this is one of the most important works that the Commonwealth has yet been asked to undertake. It is not only an important, but, I venture to say, an inevitable, work for the Commonwealth. The circumstances surrounding it are such that we' should enter upon it with the fullest consideration and the adoption of the most careful precautions such as are usually observed in connexion with similar undertakings in the States and in any self-governing community. I am not referring now to the actual cost which it is estimated this work will entail. I realize that it means the initiation of a railway policy for the Commonwealth. We know that in each of the States there is a railway system. These have been brought into being by following different policies. In some respects they are the same, and in other respects they are totally dissimilar. We have the advantage of the experience of the States to guide us in this matter, but it would appear that in submitting this proposition to Parliament the Government have not been minded by any considerations either of the past or the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment is aimed at securing information, much of which is regarded as essential in connexion with the submission of any railway proposition to a State Parliament. Other information asked for it is almost indispensable that the Commonwealth Parliament should have before it enters upon a railway policy at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked for information as to the route of the proposed railway, more definite information as to the cost of construction, the probable revenue and expenditure, and interest charged. So far as the route is concerned,it is a most important factor for consideration before any determination of the question whether or not this railway should be constructed. I am reminded of a very recent instance which occurred in one of the States, where the slightest deviation from what was understood to be the route of a certain railway led to a celebrated case in which certain suggestions were made which had to be determined upon by a Royal Commission, inasmuch as they involved the position, integrity, and status of one of the highest officers of the State. That position of affairs was brought about in the main by the fact that the question of route was not definitely determined upon, or rather was not made unmistakably understood by every member of the Parliament. It was thus fairly open to members of that Parliament and the public outside to assume that one route was taken which was hot the route which the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government subsequently stated was intended to be taken. In connexion with the case, members of the State Parliament referred to gave evidence in which they honestly expressed their opinion as to the route proposed for a line which, so far as the length and importance are concerned, was a mere bagatelle in comparison to the line referred to in this Bill. Yet it was found that there were most complete divergencies of opinion on the subject honestly entertained by members of that Parliament themselves. So far, therefore, as the route of this railway" is concerned, it is eminently desirable that Parliament should be informed exactly as to the route of the proposed line. There are many reasons for that which I need hardly dilate upon at length. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not say that. But provision is made for deviations, and I think the route should be indicated with sufficient accuracy, and only after it has been clearly ascertained that no competing route for which there is any measure of support outside or within this Chamber has been compared with it, and has been unequivocally set aside. I believe that it has been suggested, not only in this Chamber, but outside, that there are routes other than that proposed by the Government which this line might take with greater advantage to the Commonwealth, to the line as a line, so far as the cost of construction and the return of revenue from its working are concerned. I do not think that we have had sufficient information to enable us to clearly and unmistakably express our preference for the route proposed as against all the other routes that have been considered in connexion with this matter here as elsewhere. I should say that I regard the cost of construction, and the probable revenue and expenditure and interest charged, as secondary matters in the sense that I do not think that it is competent for anybody to lay down with anything like an approximation to reasonable accuracy what will be the cost of a line of this character, and still less to estimate the probable revenue and expenditure of the line. This work, as I have said, is not only important, but inevitable. It must be undertaken by the Commonwealth at some time or other, and there is no doubt that it will have to be undertaken early. But that does not justify us in walking into the enterprise blindfolded, neglectful of the ordinary precautions which any man would take about a matter which involved the expenditure of . £100 or£200. It is precisely because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment directs attention to the precautions which would be taken by a business man entering upon a transaction involving the expenditure of such a sum as I have mentioned, and because the precautions proposed are taken in every one of the States in connexion with works of a similar kind, that I think it should be regarded by the Government as essential in the proper consideration of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the Government are in a position to accept the amendment in relation to the course of business which they have laid down is a matter which is entirely within their knowledge, but I certainly think that, before asking Parliament to sanction this enterprise, precautions of this character should have been taken. In my opinion we would be regardless of our responsibilities - no matter how strongly we may believe in the necessity and justification for this connexion - if we said, " Oh, we have not the time to inquire into those circumstances. We have not the opportunity or chance of finding out if the line could be constructed under better conditions." That, in effect, is what the Bill says. Virtually it asks Parliament to sanction the construction of the line, and when the Government are asked what precautions they have taken in regard to the matters mentioned in the concluding paragraph of the amendment, what satisfaction have we got? Do we not all realize the state of uncertainty which exists in South Australia and Western Australia as to their policy towards the Commonwealth ? Do we not also realize the state of uncertainty as to what will be the policy of the Commonwealth to those two States in respect of this line if constructed? Why should we not have something more definite? Will any honorable senator say that, in the event of the railway being constructed with all these doubts and uncertainties surrounding the position, ten years afterwards, in connexion with some railway movement on the part of the Commonwealth, this may not be cited as an instance of its policy in relation to such matters? In matters of comparatively minor importance the Commonwealth has decided that it will take no course of action in relation to individual instances until it has a general policy which will apply to all cases. Is there any trouble in obtaining the information which is asked for in the amendment, or is there any doubt on the part of the Government as to what will be the result of taking such action as the amendment indicates should be taken? I do not think that there should be much trouble or much loss of time, and I believe that any differences which may exist between the three Governments would be solved on a principle of mutual understanding, and on a principle which, as far as the Commonwealth was concerned, would not, in relation to any future enterprises of this nature, prejudicially affect it or tie its hands in relation to other States. It will be realized that there are other railways which may possibly, in the very near future, come under consideration on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I allude, not merely to the possibility of a line from the northern part of South Australia to the southern or south-western part of the line from Port Darwin inland, providing that the line goes through the Northern Territory itself, but also the possibilities of lines which may be built either into or up to the borders of Queensland and New South Wales. There is the further possibility of a line to Western Australia, which may go more directly from east to west than does the proposed line; that is to say, farther north from the coast. There is not the slightest doubt that in connexion with any of these enterprises in the future, if they were decided upon, and certainly if they were contemplated, the Commonwealth will be bound to the respective States by whatever action it takes now in relation to South Australia and Western Australia. If we sanction this line, and proceed about its construction, is the Commonwealth, in respect to many matters, to be at the dictation of South Australia and Western Australia? If it is to be at such dictation in respect to any matters, then, assuredly, in the future, in connexion with any similar enterprise, it will find that it has made a precedent from which it will be hard to extricate itself. I think that it is not only desirable, but almost indispensable, that the information sought in the amendment should be obtained before further action is taken, because of the fact that we are now embarking upon a railway policy for the Commonwealth, and that whatever action is taken will bind the Commonwealth in the future. I intend to support the amendment on that ground alone. </para>

We did not get the answer except by interjection, and the comment was made by more than one  speaker  on this side that the matter ought to have come out in the speech of the Minister. As it was not given directly in his speech at the beginning of this debate, I rise for the purpose of asking him, if he chooses to reply, as I think he must do, for a clear and explicit answer to this question, Where is the money to build this railway to come from? By interjection, the Minister either expressly said, or left it to be inferred, that the answer was to be found either in his own speech, or in the Budget papers, or in some financial statement. As the question has been addressed in various forms from this side, but has not been explicitly answered, I beg to press again, even if it be for the second time, for a clear answer on that point. </para>

The information ought, I repeat, to have been supplied in clear terms in the Minister's opening speech. It ought to have been given equally explicitly during the course of this debate. I contend that it has not been given yet. This proposal involves an expenditure of anything from  ,£4,000,000  to  ^6,000,000,  to which each State will have to contribute its share. When we are asked to pass this Bill, we, as representatives of the States, are entitled to have clear and full information on the point. </para>

                            <para>- I shall worry this Bill as long as ever I choose to do so; and the more interjections that are made by Ministers, the more irritation that is displayed by them and their supporters, I assure them that the longer will be my criticism. As regards the question of cost, I ask the Minister of Defence to assume the fact that we on this side are as well acquainted with the possibilities, financial and otherwise, underlying the Australian note issue as are the Government, and that when we have asked how this railway is to be financed, we have borne in mind and understood the Australian Notes Act. Is that Act to be used in any way with regard to the financing of this work? I also ask the Minister of Defence to consider that we on this side are fairly well acquainted with the general effect and provisions of the Bill called the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which is being considered in another place. </para>

                            <para>- When we have a clear idea as to the provisions of one Act, and when we also know something of the possible application of the banking policy of the Government, we are entitled to ask, Where is the money to build this railway to come from ? I ask the question, in view of Acts which have been passed, and also in view of the expressed policy of the Government in another respect. Apart from these two questions, or, if you like, with them, what is the new financial scheme which the Government intend to devise in conjunction with financial measures which have been passed, or are contemplated to be passed? We are justified, not merely in criticising, but in holding up the Government, and exhausting every form of the Senate in order to get an explicit answer. I do not know whether I shall be transgressing the Standing Orders, sir. but from what I know and can gather of the financial policy which the Government have already outlined, they do not hold one stiver in cash for the building of this railway. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, sir. I admit the propriety of your ruling. I wish to submit another question. The second part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment reads -  and further, as. the proposed railway serves directly to assist the development of the States of Western Australia and South Australia, this Senate is of opinion that the Government should consult with the Governments of the two States -  for a certain purpose. It has been pointed out on the evidence of the report of the Commonwealth engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> that a very large portion of the country through which this line will pass will be absolutely unremunerative for railway purposes. There has been no effective answer to that criticism. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> argued that we ought to consider the needs of the growing population at the terminal points, east and west. I consider that he was quite right in submitting that view. I take an instance from the railway construction policy of the State which I have the honour to represent. The country lying between Cloncurry and Charters Towers, apart from the very narrow coastal fringe, is practically unremunerative. But 80 miles inland a population of between 25,000 and 40,000 people sprung up in consequence of the discovery of a gold-field, and a railway was constructed which ultimately proved remunerative in consequence of the profitable trade conducted between the two terminal points. But this line will be a powerful factor in developing the portion of Western Australia stretching south and east from Kalgoorlie. As Western Australia is certainly going to benefit to such an immense extent, she should be prepared to give some guarantee to the Commonwealth to cover the probable loss upon the line for a few years. There is no State in Australia which has not had to face similar disadvantages in connexion with its railway construction policy. This amendment simply asks the Government to direct the attention of Western Australia to the great advantages that will arise from the construction of the railway, and to ask her to give us some guarantee against loss. Are the other States to bear this burden? Is Western Australia to take all the proceeds from the railway which, at the expense of the Commonwealth, will make the other railways of Western Australia more remunerative than they now are? </para>

The honorable senator is debating the question of whether the construction of this line will make other Western Australian railways more remunerative. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite clear that this line must add value to the lands along the route, and ' will indirectly benefit Western Australia in other ways. If the Government insist on rushing through this measure as a matter of policy, this Senate, exercising its trust on behalf of the citizens of the Commonwealth, should insist on a clear understanding in reference to the matter raised by the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- - I have listened attentively to the debate on this Bill, and as one of the representatives of the State which will have to pay the largest amount towards the construction of the railway, I regret that, the route selected is the one upon which we are now asked to vote. Looking at this question principally as a defence proposition, I should have preferred to see a railway constructed running directly from Brisbane to Perth, or even directly from Brisbane to the south of the Northern Territory, or the north of South Australia, enabling a military depot to be formed, and thus establishing a basis for a railway which in time to come will have to be constructed through the Northern Territory. A railway built in that direction would afford excellent opportunities for connecting up New South Wales with South Australia .and Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that, and it is for that reason that I support the present proposal. If I could induce the Government to immediately undertake . the construction of a line direct from Brisbane to Perth, or to the Northern Territory,  1  would join with those led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> whose principal aim is, I take it, to obstruct the present proposal. Listening to the debate throughout, I find that two chief reasons have been given as to why this railway should not be built. One was elaborated very much by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who dissected very ably the report of Engineer Deane. He endeavoured to show how poor was the country through which the railway would run, and how little traffic it would have to carry. The other point was debated at length, and very strenuously, in another place, and will, I suppose, be considered fully in Committee in the Senate - namely, that the traffic on the railway will be so great that a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge will not be sufficient to carry it. I am rather confused between those two contentions. In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> view the country is so poor that there is no hope of traffic for years to come, except from the terminal points. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. And the argument used is that we must employ more powerful locomotives upon it. We have learned from engineers' reports that in America locomotives three times as large as those employed in New South Wales are being successfully used upon a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. But even this knowledge does not satisfy the opponents of that gauge. They clamour for a still wider gauge, so that we may use even heavier locomotives upon this line for the purpose of transporting troops and munitions of war more expeditiously. To me it appears that this line ought not to have been the first undertaken bv the Commonwealth. From a defence point of view, a railway from Brisbane to Perth should have been given precedence. But the Government have not adopted that course. I think we can well afford to allow the Bill to pass, because it is an indication that they are determined to link up the east and the west by means of a railway. Measured by their contribution to our Customs revenue, or even to the revenue which is derived from land taxation, I say that half the cost to the Commonwealth Government will be borne by the people of New South Wales. But, notwithstanding that fact, I, as a representative of that State welcome this Bill as the first direct attempt on the part of the Ministry to pre pare for the defence of Australia. If they experience any difficulty in raising the necessary money to carry out this undertaking, the construction of some of the vessels of the Australian Fleet unit may well be deferred for some time. The estimated loss upon the proposed line is  £68.000  annually, and the interest upon the capital outlay involved is set down at £140,000. If the Government were to use the reserve which has accumulated in connexion with our note issue- </para>

                            <para>- This railway, it is estimated, will cost £4.000,000, and that money will pay for itself from the very day that the railway is opened. I am' pleased that the Government have taken such a practical step towards preparing for the defence of Australia. I shall support the Bill, and vote against the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.I</inline> recognise that it does not matter how much information is supplied to honorable senators opposite; when that question comes to be discussed, they will still be as dense as ever. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> commenced his criticism of this Bill with the remark that he had no information at his disposal, and then proceeded to speak for an hour and a-half, in the course of which he supplied us with a whole heap of information. When this Bill first came before Parliament I intended to support the adoption of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, but I find that the Government have made such full inquiry into that question that it is entirely removed from the area of debatable propositions. I believe that for some years past the Victorian Government have recognised that the adoption of a 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge is inevitable, and have been making their preparations accordingly. I merely rose to make these few remarks because  . I  recognise that the Government are not anxious to get the Bill through the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- By their action last night Ministers showed that they were not anxious to get it through. I shall support the Bill, because I believe that the construction of the proposed line will strengthen the defence of Australia. I would rather have supported the building; of a railway through Central Australia, and the establishment of a military depot there as the first step towards the adequate protection of this country. Later on such a line could have been linked up with the railways of the different States.. When the details of the measure are under consideration in Committee, I shall ask the Minister whether he cannot arrange, with the various States, for the construction of branch lines by the Commonwealth to the proposed transcontinental line. One clause of the measure stipulates that the Commonwealth shall have power to link up only one mile of railway with the central line. But I am not shutting my eyes to the tone of the recent utterances of the South Australian Premier. </para>

                            <para>- If that be so and I recognise that we cannot give any Government unlimited powers of railway construction - I would like provision to be made in the Bill for the construction of lines to other States. As the proposed transcontinental railway will carry troops and munitions of war to the west in case of emergency, no sooner will it be constructed than it may be necessary to link up the railway systems of Queensland and New South Wales in a more direct way than they are linked up at present. That will be specially necessary if South Australia refuses to convert her main line to the  4-ft. 8j-in.  gauge, as Victoria proposes to do. </para>

                            <para>- If that be done, Victoria will take the Riverina trade from us. I hope that, in making provision for the construction of this line, the Minister will arrange to set apart reserves along the route upon which trees can at once be planted with a view to supplying the timber which may be required on the railway for all time. For many years New Zealand has been getting hardwoods from Australia, and planting them along her railways. When I was living in that country some time since, those hardwoods were being used for the purpose of  repairing her lines. I think that South Australia and Western Australia may easily be induced to set apart at intervals along the proposed line areas upon which the timber can be grown for renewing it from time to time. If that course be adopted, in a very few years we shall have supplies of timber for repairing this railway ready to our hands at any spot where it may be required. I mention that, because I think that now is the time for the Government to be alert, and to make ample provision for the working of this railway for many years ahead. We have been told that South Australia and Western Australia will benefit most by the construction of this line. I have heard some opposition to the measure from representatives of Queensland, but, if I represented a State as rich as Queensland, I think I should be satisfied with its richness. </para>

                            <para>- I do not cavil at anything that Queensland is getting from the Commonwealth. I think it may be admitted that, with perhaps the exception of Western Australia, Queensland is the richest State in the Commonwealth, so far as its natural resources are concerned. . I have been through Queensland, and I am aware of its great natural resources, but I am informed by an honorable senator who knows Western Australia as well as Queensland, and whom I regard as very reliable, that Western Australia is as rich in natural resources as even Queensland. I accept the honorable senator's word, and I say that if that be so, and this railway will link up with the eastern . States a State as rich as Queensland, we need not be much concerned as to whether it will cost  £3,000,000  or  £4,000,000,  or as to whether the sand will blow over the line at certain places. We should recognise that in this Bill we are taking the first step to connect with the more closely populated eastern States this very rich, and as yet almost undeveloped, western State, which I believe will in the future add very materially to the wealth of the Commonwealth. I regret very much the line of argument followed by the Leader of the Opposition. It 'is a habit with some people to brand as a desert all country with which they are not themselves well acquainted. I can remember that, when  1  was a boy, a railway was being opened to Orange, about  192  miles west of Sydney, and a very responsible and influential man said on the occasion that he had lived to see a railway open to Orange, and hoped to live to see a railway to Bourke. He was laughed at and ridiculed for suggesting that any State would run a railway through such desert country as the country between Orange and Bourke was supposed to be. But to-day there is a railway to Bourke, and almost all the way from Orange to Bourke wheatfields are being cultivated. We get into the habit of believing that the little place in which we live is productive and wealthy, and that the country beyond our horizon must be a desert. We have been told in this chamber that the Yass-Canberra district is a desert in which there is no water, and we are now told that the country through which it is proposed this line shall run is also a desert. Yet we open our eyes in wonder when people on the other side of the world say the same kind of thing about Australia. My experience of Australia, and I have been over a great deal of it, is that districts which we were led to believe were almost uninhabitable have been settled, and are now amongst the richest districts in the Commonwealth. I have said that one member of the Senate has told me that Western Australia will be as rich a State as Queensland when her resources are fully developed. If that be so, we shall find that the margin of desert country will, with railway communication, gradually shrivel up, and that, in the whole of Australia, the only country that will have the appearance of a desert will be that whose natural condition will still have remained unimproved by the hand of man. </para>

I listened with a great deal of pleasure to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> speech. Though I do not say that I agree with every word he uttered,  I heartily agree with the amendment which he has moved. I have been a railway contractor in country not far removed from the districts through which this line will pass, and, knowing the character of the country, I .think I am qualified to say a word or two on the subject. I am prepared to stake my reputation on the statement that if a railway is built through desert country, from which ~ there can be no local traffic, it must be expected to end in failure. Those who have lived any time in Australia must be aware of the great enterprise of the people, and honorable senators cannot point to a district in Australia, with the exception of that through which this line will run, that has not been developed during the long years of our occupation of this country. </para>

Honorable senators will admit that I was equally hostile to it when it was proposed by my honorable friends on this side. I am opposed to the proposal from conviction, and not because of party feeling. It is a mistake to build a line through country without natural water, and with an insufficient rainfall. There is a very low rainfall in the country through which the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta runs, but it will be only a hop, step, and a jump from this proposed line to the coast. Can any one be led to believe that this country would have remained unoccupied if it had been worth anything? I say that the fact that it has remained unoccupied is a complete answer to all that has been said about its possibilities.

                            <para>- He went over the best part of this country. But let me say that a Garden of Eden without an adequate rainfall could not be productive, and if a line of railway is run through country that is not productive, and can supply no local traffic, it must be a failure. I have been, not only a railway builder, but the owner of a railway from Echuca to Deniliquin, going through beautiful fertile country, and yet it has. not been a marvellous success from a financial point of view. There are lines even in Queensland in districts where there is a good rainfall which barely pay. lt is proposed, under this Bill, to construct a line 1,063 miles in length, and let me say here that it is proposed to make the line longer than is necessary. That is a very bad error of judgment, because if every ton of traffic on the line has to be carried 70 miles further than is necessary a great wrong will be done to the producers, and it must result in a great loss of traffic. It is proposed to construct a railway which will not cost a shilling less than £5,000,000 through country in which it will be impossible to get water unless by pumping. Much of the water that can be obtained by pumping will not be fit for use. When I was building the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta we had to carry water by our own trains for from 50 to 60 miles, and when our bullocks were unyoked in the evening it was impossible to find the yokes in the morning because they were covered with sand. T do not say that the whole of this line will be liable to be covered with sand, but there will be a great deal of sand on some parts of the line. The Commonwealth, no doubt, can afford to lose j£5, 000,000, but a terrible mistake will be made if this line is made 70 or 80 miles longer than is necessary. People will not travel by rail through country like this when they can travel by fine steamers along our beautiful coast. I say that there is no hurry for this railway at all. When it is suggested that it is necessary for defence purposes, I reply that it would be infinitely wiser to spend half the money in building a big ship or two. There will be no danger of the invasion of this country while the British Navy is able to come to our assistance. Let us wait until things are developed, and we have more population. Let me tell honorable senators that we have been very lucky in Australia. We never, previously had such seasons as we have had since 1903. During that time we have had good seasons, and good rainfall in every one of the States. If we get one or two droughts, as we may, and £70,000,000 has to be called up in London, we may be confronted with the reverse of our present happy, contented, and prosperous condition. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [3.44].- I probably should not have spoken on the second reading of this Bill at all if it had not been for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. The proposal for the construction of this railway between Western Australia and the eastern States is now an old tale amongst us, but. I recognise that railways, from the west to the east and from the north to the south must some day become accomplished facts. The question before us now is whether the time is opportune for the construction of a line, and whether this is the line which should be taken in hand first. It may be readily conceded that the Government are not in a position to undertake the construction of a railway from Port Darwin, and also the construction of another transcontinental railway. I think that if we consider these', two matters together, we shall recognise very readily that it will be much more conducive to the interests of the Commonwealth' if the railway from Port Darwin is first taken in hand. We have had an explanation made this afternoon by an honorable senator as to a source of revenue which the Government may tap in order to construct this railway, and save payment in interest. At the same time, honorable senators have heard from the Government that they propose to pay for the work, as far as they can, out of current revenue, and to borrow whatever may be necessary in order to complete the construction of the line within a reasonable time. It seems to me that if a raid is going to be made on the money which has been reserved for the protection of the notes which have been issued, if the public get the idea that the Government are not prepared to abide by the agreement which was arrived at when the Australian Notes Bill was passed, it will act most detrimentally to the credit of this country. Honorable senators may say, " Oh, it is all very well; there will be no trouble," but. they must bear in mind that they' do not live entirely to themselves, and have to look to the credit of the country both here and abroad. I do not wish to labour this point, because I recognise that it may not be pertinent to the matter under discussion. I said that I recognised that there are two great railways which, ultimately, will have to be constructed. The question is, which line ought to be taken in hand " first? To my mind, the construction of a line from Port- Darwin should be first undertaken. We accepted the transfer of the Northern Territory from South Australia with an express stipulation that we would build a particular railway. I do not say that it has to be built to-day or tomorrow, but it will have to be built within a reasonable time if we are going to keep faith with South Australia. We are under a certain obligation with regard to the Northern Territory. But is there an obligation which we have to fulfil in regard to Western Australia? We have been told times without number that one of the conditions on which Western Australia entered the Federation was that the proposed railway should be constructed. When I ask where is the evidence of that condition being made. I am told that some leading politicians made certain statements. Now, these statements have never been embodied in an Act of Parliament, nor were they ever placed before the people of Queensland or New South Wales, at any rate, when they were called upon to accept or reject the Constitution.

A Constitution Bill was submitted to the people of this country for acceptance or rej'ection, and it contained certain special provisions with regard to Western Australia in order that it should be induced to enter the Federation. What were these conditions? One condition was that Western Australia was to have a certain concession with regard to the imposition of Customs duties. The Constitution also contained a provision under which the Federal Parliament could give financial assistance to States, if necessary. If it had been one of the valid considerations to bring Western Australia into the Federation, that the proposed railway should be constructed, it would have been provided for in the Constitution as submitted to the people, or the men who represented that State at the Federal Convention were recreant to their trust.

We all realized at the time, I presume, that sooner or later it would be necessary to link up the west with the east with an iron band, but I deny that there was any condition, or stipulation, or promise given to Western Australia which should be regarded as binding upon the people of this country. I consider that this measure ought to be dealt with solely on its merits, apart from any question as to whether Western Australia believed that this special concession was to be given to her or not. Is the time ripe to undertake this work? </para>

They have worked hard and loyally for that which they believed to be right. I do not find the least fault with them on that account. They merely did their duty. Now, what is the position? Some time ago, Parliament passed a measure for the survey of a route for a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. Many of us opposed the measure, but it was carried by a majority in each House, and we have a report on a flying survey. </para>

                            <para>- We have not a detailed report, because there has not been a permanent survey. A flying survey has been made, and we have been provided with a general estimate of the cost of construction. I heard the Minister of Defence state last night that there were plans and books of reference. I ask him whether they are prepared in such a way that, if tenders were invited, a contractor could frame a tender for carrying out the whole of the work ? </para>

                                GOULD. - Even to-day the Commonwealth Government do not know what land they can take. They have no authority to take any specified area. I am told that, seven years ago, Western Australia passed a Bill providing for the construction of this railway through its territory. That" Act has expired by lapse of time, and I presume that it will be re-enacted. Did it set forth the route which was to be followed? Reserves of land were made long before the flying survey was made. The Commonwealth Government have not that exact information which they should have before they begin to build the railway.

                            <para>- The Minister explained that they are so bulky that they could not be brought into the chamber. Of course, the Department could have prepared lithographs on a small scale, which would have given some idea of them to honorable senators. Has the time arrived, I ask, for the immediate construction of this railway? To my mind, it has not, although I realize that the line has to be built. I realize that, for many purposes, the railway will be very valuable, even although it will not, as we are advised, pay working expenses and the interest on the outlay. Of course, we can only hope that in time that difficulty will be overcome, and that the expenditure will be recouped. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that Western Australia is doing splendid work with regard to peopling its territory. I wish that the other States would do equally good work. I am not one to decry Australia, because the more I see and know of it the greater faith and confidence I have in its future. Throughout this discussion there has been an insistent demand, even from those who are going to vote for the Bill, for further information. The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> appeared to me more like that of a man who desired to excuse himself for doing something opposed to his better judgment. He expressed the opinion that the railway through the Northern Territory was the proper one to undertake in the first instance. He pointed out that, from the defence point of view, the route of the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta is wrong, that it ought to be taken from Brisbane straight to Western Australia. Yet he intends to vote for the Bill. He will not even delay the passing of the Bill in order to get more information. Some honorable senators were so anxious last night to get a vote taken that it is not to be wondered at that they are, npt prepared to wait for a little more information to be supplied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asks by his amendment for more information. He has been told that he has received information. A little while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed out that not only had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> information, but that he had dissected and criticised  it most keenly. I interjected that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had received erroneous information. Do not imagine that I am making a complaint with regard to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> as an engineer. I accept his report. I have known him for a great many years as an honorable and able man ; but when he passes away from his own professional work, and begins to explain matters, to point out the great value of the route, and to become to that extent an advocate of it, and when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who happens to have some knowledge of portion of the matters referred to in the report, point out that a great deal of the report was erroneous and misconceived, I said at once, " Here are two men, one who is an expert on one question, and one who is not, which am I to follow ? It is a matter for professional knowledge, judgment, and opinion. As far as concerns the purely engineering work, I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> opinion explicitly. As to the pastoral possibilities, I prefer to take the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Official statistics are sometimes wrong, but in this instance an honorable senator who is engaged in pastoral pursuits has given us information from his own knowledge. When we have a difference of opinion of this kind, it is well that we should pause before committing the country to an expenditure of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 sterling. The Government are not possessed of sufficient powers from the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia to enable them to proceed with the construction of this railway, and to control its management. The Constitution gives us power to construct railways through- a State contingent on the consent of the State being granted. We ought therefore to obtain the consent of the two States concerned in the first instance. That step has not been taken. It is true that South Australia has passed a Bill, in connexion with the Northern Territory, which may give us sufficient powers ; but I am not quite certain as to its sufficiency. But no such Bill has been passed by Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not profess to know how much land the Government ought to acquire. But I do say that if the Commonwealth is going to connect two States by means of a railway, it can only be justified on national grounds.. The railway must be of immense value to the States themselves, and they should be prepared to treat us most generously. Remember that the railway is not going to be built with Western Australian and South Australian money, but with the money of the whole of Australia. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, the probability is that most of this money will come out of the pockets of the New South Wales people. I. take no exception to that. If the work is national, we must pay our share, even if it be a heavy one. That is our just position under Federation. I should be ashamed of New South Wales if she objected to pay her fair share of expenditure for national undertakings. But unquestionably two States will primarily benefit, and they should deal generously with the Commonwealth. We should .know what they are prepared to do before we pass a Bill of this character. Are we satisfied that they are prepared to meet the reasonable requirements of the Commonwealth Parliament and the people? We have not yet all the necessary information. We have an estimate of cost of construction, and of probable revenue, expenditure, and interest; but is that information sufficient to enable us to undertake this great obligation? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment lays down the principle that as the railway will serve directly to develop Western Australia and South Australia, the Commonwealth should get some of the benefit from the added value given to the lands of those States. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see where the analogy, comes in. Under the Constitution the Commonwealth is entitled to an area of not less than 100 square miles. Parliament asked for 900 square miles. That, area was granted - nine times the area originally contemplated. In addition, New South Wales' granted running rights for a railway down to Jervis Bay, and a strip of land on the coast. Therefore, New South Wales made a generous response. Have the two States to be benefited by this railway treated the Commonwealth similarly? I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment, believing it to be a proper statement of the position. As to the question of gauge, my own inclination is to accept the gauge specified by Ministers. Some honorable senators may say, perhaps, " As you come from New South Wales you naturally accept the gauge prevailing there." But I take the view that the gauge question has been thoroughly threshed out elsewhere. The largest mileage of railways in the world is constructed on the 4-ft.8½-in. gauge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> formerly Chief Railways Commissioner in New South Wales, took into consideration the question of uniformity, strongly advocating that there should be one gauge throughout Australia. I believe that the 4-ft.8½-in. gauge was the one which he thought should be adopted. </para>

                                left the question open in the hope of securing the concurrence of the States to the establishment of a uniform gauge. I am informed that it is possible to run 400-ton engines over a 4-ft.8½-in. railway. At any rate, in the event of this Bill being read a second time, I shall not be found contesting the validity of the proposal made by the Government in this regard.

                        <para>. - Quite a few minutes will be all that I shall require to make several, what I consider to be, necessary remarks on this Bill. As a matter of fact, I shall endeavour to model a speech rather on the style of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. I heard that amendment described by the Minister of Defence as " a modified speech." I cannot help thinking that that kind of modified speech is rather an improvement. Whether I can imitate it or not, I shall try. I do not intend to dilate on any other suggested railway scheme. This proposal should be considered entirely on its own merits. We have nothing to do now with lines in the Northern Territory or the Federal Capital. The only question is : Is this, or is it not, a sound and satisfactory commercial undertaking? I know that that question does not suggest pleasing ideas to some members of the Senate. But it is the question that any private person or company would ask. The answer is, " Emphatically no."  I  admit that, in matters of railway construction, the question of profit does not exhaust the subject for a moment. There are many indirect reasons, which are often stronger than the direct reasons, for building a given line of railway. But do such indirect reasons apply in this instance? Can it be said that this railway, in its indirect effects, is going to benefit Australia? Are we, by authorizing it, going to spend money that will give satisfactory results to the Commonwealth in an indirect way? I cannot see that in any way. I cannot see that the Commonwealth is going to derive that indirect benefit which ought to be a justification for building such a railway. Is it a direct benefit that the proposal is going to be a source of loss for a great many years? Certainly not. What is going to counterbalance that loss? Additional value given to land ? Increased settlement ? Where is it ? No one has suggested anything of the kind. In all the estimates of revenue which have been received, only one source of income has been suggested, namely, the revenue from passengers. It has never been suggested that there will be any revenue from the development of the land, from freight, from the carriage of stock. No one thinks for a moment that there is going to be any freight over this line. The thing is not thinkable in face of competition by sea. Any business man, looking at the thing from a commercial point of view, would say at once that there is nothing to justify the construction of the line at all. I am compelled, therefore, to ask : What is the real reason for it ? We all know the reason. This line is to be constructed for sentimental reasons. There are no others - none whatever. The sentimental reason I will admit, at once, is the real reason. It necessarily appeals to every representative from South Australia and Western Australia. The view which they take is, " Because we think that Western Australia is isolated, whereas she ought to be connected by railway with the eastern States, we shall vote for the Bill." </para>

                            <para>- And the sentiment which I have expressed arises from the fact. If there are other reasons why this line should be constructed, what are they? Of course, we have been told that it is required for defence purposes. But if the object of the Commonwealth be to strengthen our defences by the expenditure of £4,000,000, or £5,000,000, I submit that that money will be very badly expended upon this railway. There is not a member of this Chamber who could not propose a better scheme. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If we wish to spend £5,000,000 in strengthening our defences it is ridiculous to suggest that we cannot spend it in a better way. Consequently this line is going to be built for sentimental reasons. How is it to be paid for, and are we justified in indulging in this sentimental expenditure? As far as I can understand the position, for the first year or two the money for its construction will be taken out of revenue, and the balance required will, subsequently, be borrowed. Now, there was a time when honorable senators opposite said that they objected to public borrowing. </para>

                            <para>- And many honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber will agree with that view. But is the line which forms the subject of this Bill a reproductive work? Certainly not. The money for its construction is to be borrowed, and the people of Australia are to be made liable for its repayment with interest for purely sentimental reasons. Is the adoption of such a course justifiable? Where are we going in pur expenditure? </para>

                    <para class="block">I recognise that this is a fairly heavily taxed community already and, as a Free Trader, I object to the enormous amount of revenue which is being raised through the Customs. I am perfectly certain that every true Protectionist equally objects to the same thing. Either that revenue will increase, or it will decrease. If it increases the bad state of things which obtains to-day will be accentuated, because it will be said, " Oh, let matters remain as they are, because we require the money." But no honest Protectionist will take that view. If Protectionists declare that the existing taxation is too heavy for the people of Australia, what will happen in regard to the demands which will be made upon us? There will be no way of meeting our enormous liabilities, except, through Customs taxation. It is true that we have a land tax in operation, but the amount which it returns to the Commonwealth is a mere detail. It yields only about £1,500,000 annually: and, to my knowledge, it has been allocated to half-a-dozen different projects. Consequently, the money to meet our obligations will have to come out of the only source of revenue which we have - the Customs. A few words more and I shall have finished my remarks. We have before us the example of South Australia, which indulged in a similar scheme to that which we are now considering - a scheme to build her own railway to the Northern Territory. But what was that State's good fortune? When Federation was established, South Australia found a more wealthy authority willing to relieve her of the trouble which she had created for herself. </para>

                            <para>- I have not said one word about the demands of South Australia or Western Australia. The only reference which I made was a playful one to the effect that South Australia was fortunate enough to get the Commonwealth to relieve her of a heavy burden. The Minister ought not to have dragged into this debate the reference which he made to Tasmania. What Tasmania deserves is a matter for this Parliament to decide. In conclusion, I have only to add that, as we cannot afford to build this railway, we ought not to pass the Bill. </para>

That grant will stand upon its merits.

If an enemy were established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. Their isolation is, therefore, a menace to the rest of Australia. . . . The interests of the whole continent, therefore, demand that the railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other colonies should be made as soon as possible. </para>

The point is that this eminent general considers that these connexions should be made in the best interests of Australia. In  1903,  General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton gave us an opinion practically coinciding with that expressed by General Edwardes. Later on, we had the advantage of the opinion of Lord Kitchener, who was specially invited to visit Australia to report on these very questions. These reports have convinced me that it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that this railway should be constructed. </para>

                    <para>I might justify my vote on these grounds alone, but I shall say a word with respect to some of the arguments which have been advanced against the construction of this line. One with respect to the alleged inferior character of the country has already been ably replied to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The king-pin argument adduced against this measure is that it proposes the construction of what will be practically a desert railway. I am quite used to that kind of argument in my own State. When King Island was first occupied, the land there was described as being absolutely worthless, or fit only to run a few sheep on. Yet it is to-day a very populous little island, and very much enhanced prices have to be paid by any one who wishes to secure land there. The same kind of argument has . often been used in connexion with centra] Tasmania. It is mostly made use of by Conservatives. The centre of Tasmania is held, for the most part, in big areas, and the statement that the country is fit only for sheep grazing has been persisted in for years, notwithstanding the fact that the lowest annual rainfall recorded for any part of that district of Tasmania is 17 inches. </para>
                    <para>We all know that modern farming methods have so improved, and modern science has made it possible to so increase the fertility of soil, that it is possible in agriculture to improve greatly upon what could have been done a few years ago. In dealing with a matter of this kind, honorable senators must depend upon. the reports of experts; and it is well that we have such reports because, if we had to adopt the opinions of honorable senators opposite, I should shudder for the result. We have received reports from men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castella,</inline> who have been over the country traversed by the route of this railway, and say that they found a great deal of very valuable land there. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that ; and I am further led to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir</inline> is regarded as one of the most reliable public servants of Western Australia. It is not to be believed that a man with a reputation like that, after going over the country, would submit a report to the effect that its character has been very largely misrepresented if he could not fully justify that report. I prefer to take his opinion rather than the opinions we have h.,d expressed from the other side. We have listened to the criticism that we cannot find the money to build this railway. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger wants to know how the Government are going to finance it. Others have said that the Government must resort te a borrowing policy. I believe that they will make an honest attempt to finance the construction of this line without borrowing; and if, later on, it should be found necessary to borrow, we shall have our financial machinery so perfected that, instead of having to go cap in hand to the money-lenders of England, we shall be able to call upon our own Commonwealth Bank to take a hand in floating the necessary loan for us and so save the brokerage and commission charges which have had to be paid on loans raised by the States. I suppose that honor - able senators are aware that the national debts of the States amount to about £270,000,000, and that of that sum, £80,000,000 has been paid in brokerage and commission, leaving out interest. Yet we are accused by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and others of his kidney, with being schoolboys in finance when we propose to finance our undertakings honestly out of revenue. The history of the past proves that the financial policies of the States have led to loose and lavish expenditure. The motto, " Easy got, easy go," has been very applicable to the way in which the States have squandered the money they have raised by way of loans.  1  can quote an example of this kind of high finance from my own State. Tasmania has borrowed £11,000,000. She has paid £11,000,000 in interest, and still owes £11,000,000. That is the kind of thing which it takes a schoolboy to understand. It has been estimated, by good financiers in Tasmania, that if we had taxed ourselves to the extent of £200,000 a year for the last fifty years, we might have paid for our public works out of revenue. Yet we are to-day paying £400,000 a year in interest in little Tasmania. The borrowing system of the States has lent itself to loose and profligate expenditure; and I am glad to know that the Government intend to finance this great project, to a great extent, by means of the note issue. This will be more sensible than going to the money-lenders of Great Britain. The Government, also, will finance the undertaking, as far as possible, out of revenue. </para>

Taking all matters into consideration believe that there is only one course open to those who desire to see the Commonwealth progress, and that is to vote for this Bill. If we voted for further information it would simply kill the measure. Honorable senators opposite may laugh, but what I mean is that the object of the request for further information is really to shelve the Bill. That is what honorable senators opposite desire to do. Honorable senators may. find, amongst the Senate papers, a pile of reports 2 inches thick, supplying data of every kind in connexion with this railway. </para>

                            <para>- Probably not, but I do not consider that a very vital matter in view of the attitude which the South Australian Government have all along adopted towards this proposal. I am content to leave that matter to negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia. I am content to rest on the weight of evidence supplied by reports submitted to the Senate during the last ten years. I think that we should not prolong the agony by assenting to delay for the purpose of obtaining further information, but should, as speedily as possible, link up this vast continent with this great iron road. </para>

I wish to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was in error in stating that the Victorian Government must have been in favour of the construction of this line, in view of the fact that they were anticipating its construction in the building of rolling-stock for the 4-ft.8½-in. gauge. I have already admitted that rolling-stock has been converted in Victoria, but I have explained that the Government knew nothing about what was being done. It has been done by the order of some one' in the Railway Department, but I have been informed that neither the Government nor. Parliament knew anything . about the change in the construction of rolling-stock. The letter which we have' before us to-day by the courtesy of the Minister of Defence, from  the  Acting Premier of Victoria, puts quite a different aspect on the matter. Addressing the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> writes as follows - </para>

                            <para>- I am not mentioning the question of break of gauge. I arn speaking of engineering and financial problems, and these are mentioned in the amendment, which deals with the route, the cost of construction, the revenue and expenditure, and the interest charged. I wish to correct the idea that the Victorian Government have in any way signified their acceptance of this measure, or are prepared to fall into line. There are only two points which remain to be settled. One point I am not permitted to mention, and the other is the question of route. To my mind, the latter 5s very vague and shadowy. It is set down in the Bill, and will have to be carried out, unless, of course, the measure is amended. I hope that the Minister will deal with these two points in his reply. Very strong reasons have been laid before the Senate iri support of the contention that the right route has not been taken. That matter should, I think, be left open for further determination. I think that if the Minister will leave open the question of the route and the question of the gauge for further discussion with the two States, there will be no trouble in passing the Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know that there is any need for a representative of Western Australia to apologize for speaking on this measure. I do not intend to speak at any length, because I recognise that the proposal has been brought before the Senate so often that it is very difficult to say anything fresh. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had not moved his amendment, I would have been quite content to allow the debate to close without speaking. When an amendment of that kind is submitted, and one remembers that since this question was last discussed here the membership of the Senate has changed to a great extent, it becomes necessary to point out that a great deal of information has been collected, and' that the proposal has been discussed here from time to time. I have taken the trouble to look through the records of the Senate to find out how many papers .have been presented on the subject by various Governments.' They would make an enormous pile. In  1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Y. O'Connor, the Engineer-in-Chief for Western Australia, and a very able engineer indeed, presented the first paper on the question from the engineering stand-point. In  1902  we had an equally well-known paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir,</inline> who is a surveyor, and who spoke so well of the country between Kalgoorlie and Eucla. In  1903  we had a very important and favorable report from the Engineers-in-Chief of the various States. There is no denying the fact that they compiled the report under a sense of great responsibility, because they knew that they were dealing with a proposal in which their respective States would be financially concerned. Then, at the end of the year, we had a final report on the matter from the same gentlemen. In  1904  we had a report on the strategical importance of the railway. In  1905  we had a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castella</inline> on the boring operations carried on along the route, giving a minute description of the country, dealing with the possibility or probability of getting water, and explaining the actual working conditions encountered by the party which went over the route. In  1908  we had a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> when a survey was proposed. In  j 9 10  we had several reports. The papers which I am enumerating are-, perhaps, some of the many reports which have been furnished. Probably I have omitted' to quote a number of them in looking up the records. In  J910  we had a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> the Engineer* in-Chief at Perth, on the probable water supply. That, together with telegrams as to the plan, and so on, is to be found iti <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Paper</inline> No.  15.  On the  15th  September of that year we had a still <inline font-style="italic">further</inline> report on the artesian water along the route presented, though it was not printed. In the present year we have had presented a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hales</inline> regarding the gauges of the railways of Australia, and touching on the question of unification of gauge, and so on. We have had a memorandum on the same subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> and also a report by that gentleman, which is known as <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Paper</inline> No.  25.  Later we had presented to us some correspondence between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments on the gauge question. Another paper from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Smith has been placed very recently before honorable senators. I find that still another paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> - <inline font-style="italic">Parti amen*tary Paper</inline> No.  49  - has been presented. To-day a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Smith was laid on the table by the Minister of Defence. It will be seen that, from time to time, the Senate has been presented with an enormous number of papers dealing with the finding of water, the nature of the country to be traversed, the cost of constructing the railway, and the probable revenue. Indeed, it would weary one to attempt to wade through the numerous papers. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite another matter. I am answering the contention of the Opposition that the Senate has not been provided with sufficient information, and that the passage of the measure should be delayed in order to get further information. If we were to wait until the crack of doom it would be difficult to get information to satisfy honorable senators opposite. I see very little prospect of our getting better information than we have received. Now, how is it possible to get information about a country which, to a great extent, is unsettled? Such information can only be obtained from the engineers and surveyors who have prepared reports on various matters. I do not see how honorable sena'tors can expect to get better and more satisfactory information than that which has been supplied. Whether the railway will be a paying proposition or not is not, to me, a very important matter, for the reason that that fact was weighed when the line was originally promised to Western Australia. The very men who led Western Australia to believe that a transcontinental railway would be built as soon as Federation was brought about, knew the state of affairs. They made public references to the matter, and their words are on record where they said that they did not expect that for years to come the railway would be a paying proposition. Nevertheless, these men said that, as soon as Western Australia joined the Federation, so soon  would the railway be built, and the union made a reality. </para>

At that juncture, the Federal movement in Western Australia was in a very critical position. The Federalists of Western Australia were just as ardent, perhaps, as the Federalists in any other part of the continent, but they realized that something must be done to encourage Western Australia to enter the Federation. They recognised that the Federation was not to be a mere empty thing; that it was to be brought about for the benefit of the States ; and that if Western Australia was not to gain some advantage as well as the eastern States, there was little probability of its people voting yes. </para>

                            <para>- I have one other quotation to make to show that a promise was definitely made. There is a well-known gentleman whom we are all pleased to have still with us. Some of the great Federalists have passed away, and can no longer, take the responsibility for their words. The one from whom I have just quoted is still filling a prominent position. There is another who is also prominent in the affairs of this country. He recognised that Federation would be a mere farce if one-third of the continent was left out. He knew that Western Australia at that time was in a prosperous condition. She was building up her secondary industries. </para>

I congratulate the Government upon the business-like way in which they have proceeded with this measure. I hope that all the doleful predictions of the opponents of the scheme will be doomed to failure. I know something about the country through which the line will run. I know that much of it is good country. There are hundreds of miles in Western Australia that used to be considered desert, but which to-day are amongst the best wheat-producing land in Australia. The sandy soils of Western Australia have been shown by actual experiment to be excellent wheat lands of the best kind. Important towns have sprung up in parts that were formerly considered to be waste.. I dare say we shall find just as many pleasant surprises in the country to be opened up by this line. I also hope that the railway will do much to open up a large tract of auriferous country. If it does so, that will help to pay the cost of the line. I shall not touch upon the value of the undertaking from a defence stand-point, because that subject has been dealt with time and again. But  1  hold that we are entitled to connect Western Australia by railway with the eastern States for no other reason than that of defence considerations.

When I was before the electors some six years ago, I told them, amongst other things, that, if returned to the Commonwealth Parliament, in order to do justice to Western Australia,  I  would support the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill which had so frequently been rejected. When I became a member of the Senate, that measure was brought forward by the Deakin Government, and I then fulfilled my pledge. At the same time, I made it clear that I was not committed to the building of the proposed line unless the report of the surveyors was a satisfactory one. To my mind, their report is a satisfactory one, and, therefore, I most warmly support the Bill. Whatever may be said of the little troubles which the Opposition is endeavouring to rake up- </para>

I am prepared to trust the Government, and I am sure that South Australia will do. justice to the Commonwealth in connexion with this measure. We have been frequently told that the proposed railway will traverse worthless country. But I would remind honorable senators that, years ago, the same statement used to be made about South Australia itself, and that some of our best country was then described as valueless. The railway which we are now considering is to be constructed primarily for the purposes of defence, and defence being a national question, the undertaking ought to be paid for by the Commonwealth. I believe that the amendment which has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was concocted and prepared in the Caucus. I have weighed it in the balance and found it wanting I am glad to know that the Government will be in office when the preliminary arrangements will require to be made for the construction of this line, because I am satisfied that they will do what is right in the interests of the Commonwealth and of the States. On behalf of South Australia, I congratulate them, and I heartily support the Bill. </para>

                                (Tasmania) [5.21]. - To me the debate has been most interesting, and especially the speeches delivered by representatives from South Australia and Western Australia. The glowing colours in which the future of those States has been painted, would almost lead one to suppose that there is no need for them to ask the Commonwealth to build this railway. They could easily carry out the work themselves. I was very much interested in the suggestion of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                                that areas should be reserved along the route of the proposed line for the purpose of planting trees, with a view to supplying the timber which may be required for the railway in the future. He spoke of growing sleepers upon country which will not grow grass . The attitude which I have always adopted in regard to. this proposal is that Western Australia should be linked up with the eastern States. It is all a question of the route which should be adopted. I unhesitatingly say that I shall support the amendment of Senator Millen, though, in principle, I adhere to my former view that Western Australia should be connected with the eastern States by railway. The vital point which we have to consider is the route which should be followed.: If the information which has been collected is found to be incorrect, 'and the line should prove a most difficult line to negotiate, our money will have been wasted. Would it not be far better for Western Australia and South Australia to wait a little bit longer and make absolutely sure that the best route has been chosen? Then, if we have to build a line through the desert, let us do so. But at present we do not know that there are not better routes unsurveyed. When we voted £50,000 for the survey of the proposed line, that survey was not restricted to this particular route.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                                very wisely said, in effect, " We want one line - a line which will give us a reasonable assurance that it will not be tampered with in time of national emergency." The soundest words uttered in this debate emanated from him. We ought to ascertain what is the best route for the line to follow from the stand-point of defence considerations. I have heard military authorities declare that Western Australia should be linked up with the eastern States, but they have never expressed an opinion as to the route which ought to be taken. They have never been asked for such an opinion. Lord Kitchener, in his report, affirms that the railways which have already been constructed are a source of danger to the Commonwealth. If that be so, I ask honorable senators whether the proposed line will not accentuate the danger.

RUSSELL (Victoria) 15.27]. - Although I recognise that very little remains to be said upon this Bill I do not care to allow a division to be taken upon the motion for its second reading without placing my views upon record. Though I do not believe that the measure is perfect, I wish to congratulate the Government upon their determination to reach finality on some of the big Australian questions which we have to face. Whilst I am not prepared to recognise any of the early promises which were made to the people of Western Australia in respect of the proposed line - because I deny the right of any politician to commit Australia to a certain policy - still I know that those promises had considerable weight with the electors of that State. I am not an authority upon defence matters, but even an ordinary layman can recognise that it is necessary that the eastern States should be linked up with Western Australia by rail, if we are to have anything like an effective defence of this country.. I support the proposed line, because I am an Australian, and have faith in Australia, and because it is just about time that we got a move on in order to evidence our faith in it.

                            <para>- Really the honorable senator has said so much on the subject that we are at a loss now to know what he desired to say. When we are told that the country through which this railway is to be constructed is a desert, I am reminded that it is not many years since responsible men - not people outside, or visitors to Australia - referred in this very Chamber to portions of Victoria, from which we are to-day receiving the most bountiful harvests, as desert country. I believe we have in this State a mile of railway for every 16 square miles of territory, yet we have large areas of land very suitable for wheat-growing upon which there is no settlement. Why is this the case? It it not because the land will not grow wheat, or is not fit for settlement, but because the Government of the State have so far neglected to provide it with railway communication. From our limited knowledge of the country through which this railway will run, it is suggested that the man is a hero who crosses it; but, as a matter of fact, we know very little about it. </para>

                            <para>- If I honestly believed that the country on the route of this railway, for some distance beyond the South Australian border into Western Australia, was the desert country it has been described,  1  have such faith in the development of Western Australia that I would still be prepared to support this railway. There are indications now of a strong tendency on the part of the people, especially of Great Britain, to look to Australia as a country in which to settle, and it is admitted that we have at present comparatively but a very small population. It may be said that it would not be possible <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> grow wheat all along the proposed railway ; " but no one will contend that there is not a considerable area of land which will be served by this line which could be settled, and thus aid in the progress of the country.I have always consistently supported both transcontinental railways. I believe that Australia can well afford to meet the cost of their construction. The worst that so far has been said about this proposal is that it may lead to an annual loss of £70,000 a year. </para>

I am not affirming the infallibility of the estimate that has been presented to us'. But I say that, in considering, we must not forget the enormous development of places in Western Australia that were considered some time ago to be unfit for settlement. Western Australia is being very rapidly settled, and I believe that, in a very short time, it would be found that this railway would pay. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to consider that suggestion ; and. in answer to the honorable senator, let me say that, by first building the line, and then encouraging settlement, and so adding to its revenue-earning capacity, we shall take the best means of getting our money back. That is the course which has been followed in all of the States in connexion with railway construction. I could mention lines within less than 3 miles of this building that, when first constructed, did not pay, but which are now paying handsomely. Because this line would not pay from the start, that is no reason why we should hold back the development, not merely of Western Australia and South Australia, but of the Commonwealth as a whole. There is only one other point to which I wish to refer, and that is the gauge proposed. I say frankly that, prior to a perusal of the reports which have been submitted, I thought that the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, because of its greater width, would be superior to the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge proposed for this line. But, after looking through the reports, and carefully studying the whole position, I have no hesitation whatever in consenting to the proposal to build this line on the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge. I will give my reasons for saying so. During the last fifteen years, we in Victoria have been vitally interested in the question of the standard gauge to be adopted for Australia. Probably the bulk of the people who have not looked into the question deeply would claim superiority for the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; but, during the period I have mentioned our railways in this State have been controlled by eleven or twelve different Railways Commissioners, who have been building our rolling-stock with a view to the ultimate conversion of our lines to a standard gauge of 4 ft. 8i in. Tn the circumstances, whatever claim Victoria may have at one time put forward for the superiority of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge appears to have been abandoned, and, from the information T have been able to obtain, on the most reliable authorities, I think it has not been proved that the 5-ft. . 3-in.gauge is very much superior to the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge. I am prepared to give a wholehearted support to this Bill, and will content myself with trying to secure one or two improvements which I think might be made in the measure in Committee. </para>

                        <para>, - One reason for submitting the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is that we believe a better route can be found for this railway than that proposed in the Bill. We believe, also, that more information should be obtained about other routes before the Bill is allowed to go through. The two States most directly interested have not yet made up their minds as to what they are going to do. We are being asked to pass this Bill before we have any authority from either of these States to construct a line within their territory. We have heard a great deal about the promise that was made to Western Australia ; but since the time when it is alleged that promise was made, the Western Australian Parliament has passed a Bill authorizing the construction of a railway within that State. Whether it was to follow the route of the line proposed in this Bill I do not know. But through some disagreement with the South Australian Government the Western Australian Act was allowed to remain a dead letter. We require further time in order to learn what terms Western Australia is prepared to give the Commonwealth. We wish to know what offer the Western Australian Government  will make. We do not desire that the Commonwealth should be bound in this matter, whilst the two States specially interested are left free to do as they please. </para>

                            <para>- I must ask you, sir, to excuse me. I was drawn off the track by interjections from in front and behind me by honorable senators representing Western Australia, who were twitting me with opposing this proposal as a representative of Queensland. We should have further time to discover what is the best route for this railway. We should not rush into the construction of this line before the route has been properly decided, or until alternative routes have been laid before us. It is a common practice in the States when railway construction is proposed to have alternative routes surveyed, leaving Parliament to decide what is the best. In this case that opportunity has not been afforded the Federal Parliament. 'I think that there is sufficient evidence before us to enable us to decide that the route proposed is not the best route, and it would be wise to defer the construction of the line until we get more information. The Government seem to be in haste to rush this measure through without knowing what the position of the Commonwealth will be. We have, so far, not been given a grant of land, not alone on either side of the proposed line, but for the line itself. The amendment further suggests that we should get further information about the cost of construction. Surely that is information which we should have. We have received information concerning this! proposal from the Government piecemeal. We have had an estimate of the cost of construction put before us only to-day, when almost every member of the Senate has spoken on the second' reading and on the amendment.This shows that the Bill is being rushed through without proper consideration. To-day, we have had placed in our hands a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> regarding the revenue and expenditure. I observe that he give a fresh estimate. I think that if cautious men were dealing with a proposal to expend a sum like this, they would say, . " Wait for further information." But on the last day of the debate on the second reading of this Bill, as I hope it will be, fresh information is placed in our hands. Probably more information will be supplied next week, and further information a month hence. In his last memorandum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> says - </para>

                    <para class="block">I notice that all the estimates we get, emanate from the two States directly interested in the construction of this railway.. We do not get any estimates from other engineering or railway authorities. The; estimate which I have just quoted was supplied ina previous memorandum. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> is an engineer ; but I do not think that he knows much about the management, of a railway. I am not going to dispute his engineering ability, but I think, from information I have received, I can legitimately dispute his ability as a railway manager. I do not know whether that estimate is correct or not. I very much doubt if it Is. Next, Mr. Deane estimates the working expenses. I want the Minister in his reply to deal with this matter, because it is being watched by railway men who know what the cost is. It is of no use to set down figures in a document for our perusal it they will not stand the light of day. In the case of a railway which is to be taken through some of the poorest parts of Australia, where I think the working expenses will be more than on any other railway, the cost for  441,792  train miles is put down at 5s. per mile, or, in all, at  £1 10,448.  1 should like to know from the Minister what authority there is for that statement. I am informed that the amount is insufficient ; and if that is the case, the report must be misleading. I have been asked to call attention to the matter by men' who know the cost in other States. For what purpose can the cost be set down at 5s. per mile unless it is to reduce the deficiency as much as possible? What we want to know is, What amount a railway manager - not an engineer - would put down for working expenses? That includes the cost of stationmasters, guards, engine-drivers, porters, coal, water, and ether material.  My information is that the -working expenses will' be more on the proposed railway than on any existing line. The cost in this case is under-estimated, and persons think that it is under-estimated for a reason. They . may be wrong, or they may be right. I .do not know. I have simply conveyed to the Senate information which I have received from a man who is competent, if he likes, to give the truth. I ask the Minister in his reply to tell us on what this estimate is based? Nothing is allowed for the wear and tear of the line, for the gangs who will have to keep it in repair, unless, of course, the expense is included in the estimate of 5s. per mile. I do not believe that it is included, because I am told that even 5s. per mile is too low a sum to set down for ordinary working expenses. .Another part of the amendment reads - </para>

                        <para>And, further, . as the proposed railway serves directly to assist the development of the States of South Australia and Western Australia, this Senate is of opinion that the Government should consult with the Governments of the two States, with a view to devising an arrangement' securing to the Commonwealth a reasonable portion of any value added to the lands along the. line of route and accruing from the construction df the said line. </para>

                    <para>We have no guarantee from the State Governments concerned.. The land has been painted in glowing colours, by senators from South Australia and Western . Australia. I .do not: blame them ; in fact, I give them all credit for trying to get this measure put through. But I happen to represent another State, whose people do not think that it will be to their advantage to pay a portion of the cost of constructing this transcontinental railway, or to be saddled for all time with a share of the loss on its working. In Queensland we are constructing, at our* own expense, more miles of railway than it is proposed to com struct across a continent. We are not asking a State, or anybody else, to help us. . </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, sir, I am transgressing the rules a little. My information is that the needs of the people of the Commonwealth will be served better by the Senate accepting the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who has used very clear and concise language. If it is accepted, that will not prevent us, at the proper time after further information has been obtained, and the Senate knows what the State- Governments intend to do, and what facilities they are prepared to offer us - from dealing with the Bill on its merits. I do not think that it would be in the 'interests of the people of the Commonwealth to pass the measure at the present time. I believe' that a little delay will be advantageous, and will not defer the matter beyond what the States are doing. Neither of the- two States is prepared to act. We have . no. information that they are prepared to pass a Bill authorizing the Commonwealth- to build the railway this year. By carrying this amendment, next year we should know what the two States had agreed' to do, and our own responsibility relating to the' railway when it was built. Honorable senators on the other side are apparently eager to pass the measure without any information,' and without any restrictions, and to allow, the State Parliaments, to make their own terms. If the Bill is passed without this amendment,, the Ministry will say, " We have an Act ' which authorizes us to' build a- railway. ' Parliament has practically done with the matter, and we will make What terms we think fit with the States." Be- fore honor-able senators pass the measure they should take time to deliberate. I arn sorry to say that the Senate does not seem to know what it is doing. It is not taken into' the confidence of the Government or of the State Parliaments, but it is asked to pass a Bill ; and when we learn later what the State's have done we shall be bound hand and foot, and cannot go back That is a very bad course for Parliament to  pursue; it should not allow the control of this matter to pass out of its hands. I opposed this proposal when it was brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I am not opposing this measure because it is submitted by the present Ministry. I hope that even at the eleventh hour the Government will reconsider their position, and take time to ascertain what the two States intend to do. When they have satisfied themselves that the States are prepared to make reasonable concessions, and that at some future time we may be able to get our money back, they will, I venture to say, get the Bill put through with a great deal less trouble than they are going to have now. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am going to deal straight away with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline> Although thirsting for information which he challenged me to give when I rose to reply, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> knowing that I was the next  speaker,  immediately left the chamber. So much for his dying thirst for information ! The honorable senator pointed out that, in an estimate which he incorrectly said was supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> but which was really the estimate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moncrieff,</inline> the South Australian Railways Commissioner, the working expenses per train mile run were put down at 5s. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> said that that was too low an estimate, and he gave that as an instance of the inaccuracy and unreliableness of the report from which he quoted. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> will turn to the official <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> of the Commonwealth he will find that the cost per train mile run for the whole of the Commonwealth railways last year was 51.38 pence; that is,  roughly, 4s. 3£d. per train mile, or 15 per cent, lower than the estimate in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moncrieff's</inline> calculation. So that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moncrieff</inline> has increased the cost 15 per cent., although the average given in the official <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> is the highest for the last ten years. Another point was made by another honorable senator during the course of the debate, as to the weight of the rails. An attack was made on the engineers, who were said to be unreliable and unworthy of credence, because they specified 70-lb. rails. I have here a paper, which has also been supplied to honorable senators, containing an estimate ordered to be printed on 28th November, 191 1. It shows the length of the various railways throughout Australia, their gauge, the weight of the rails, and the speed of trains. I notice that the honorable senator who thirsted for this information has also gone out. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that the argument was used that this line would be unsafe, and that here is a railway that carries some of the busiest traffic in Australia, over which express trains travel with the mails from Adelaide to Melbourne, and which runs through mountainous country. Yet it is provided with rails 9 lbs. lighter than are to be provided for this proposed railway, which will run over flat country with hardly a curve in it: Honorable senators opposite profess that they are quite willing', if the line is shown to be necessary for the purpose of defence, to vote for the Bill. If they had heard my speech in introducing this measure, they would have listened to a quotation which I read from Lord Kitchener's report on the subject. Some of them certainly heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> quotation from Major-General Bevan Edwards._ The honorable senator also quoted "a telling passage from <inline font-weight="bold">Major -</inline> General Hutton. But notwithstanding this, after saying that they were prepared to vote for the line if it were shown to be necessary for defence purposes, they brush aside all these authorities, and say that the line is not necessary for defence purposes.

                        <para>The Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Verran)</inline> in reply to a question, said that he had heard nothing of any hitch in respect to the Western Australian railway. South Australia had given all the necessary land, but had refused to give half-a-mile on each side to enable the Federal Government to build townships. He did not think that the Federal Parliament would alter the gauge, but if the Inter-State lines had to be converted the Commonwealth Government would meet half of the cost. </para>

That is quite true. But I would point out that those lines were constructed prior to Federation. If they had not been; the States would probably have put for-, ward a claim that the Commonwealth should pay for them. Without railway connexion of State with State, we get isolation. Western Australia and Tasmania are isolated iri a way that no other States in the Commonwealth are isolated, because all the other States have railway communication with each other. Therefore, Federation in the case of Western Australia and Tasmania cannot be as real as it is in the case of the other States. I was rather astonished to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> prophecy that np European nation would come to Australia. When we see a European nation prepared to spend£2, 500,000 per day to maintain a war against a country for the purpose of grabbing part of the African desert, and of gaining control over a people who can be controlled only at the point of the bayonet - when we see a nation loaded with debt- </para>

                        <para>With regard to the advisability of substituting the Gawler Range route for the approved one, I beg to call the attention of the Minister to the following extract from the report of the Engineers-in-Chief of nth October,1911:  - </para>
                        <para>The prospects of the country to be served by the Tarcoola route as to pastoral and mineral advantages were incomparably in excess of those to be expected from the Gawler Range route. </para>
                        <para>The Acting Surveyor-General, South Australia, in a minute to the  Hon.  the Commissioner for Crown Lands, dated 5th February, 1908, in recommending a route somewhat north of the proposed one, held out the prospect of tapping an area of from 117,000 to 120,000 square miles of pastoral country; and the Government Geologist and the Chief Inspector of Mines pointed out, in minutes of the 7th and 8th February, 1908, the prospects of the gold mines and copper mines in the districts traversed. With regard to the Gawler Range route it is to be observed that, while distance might be saved and economies effected by adopting it, the countries served would by no means be so extensive, and it has, moreover, already the advantage, as far as the coast strip is concerned, of lines of steamers touching at various ports of call ; and as regards the area adjacent to the Gawler Range, we are informed that the South Australian Government have a well thought out project for extending to Port Lincoln-Yeelanna railway in two directions so as to tap it, and these 'important lines are likely to be authorized. This being the case, it may be concluded that any further consideration of the Gawler Range route is quite unnecessary. </para>
                        <para>The above goes to show the reasons why this route was previously rejected, and it is scarcely necessary for me to point out that any wheat that is produced along that route would, undoubtedly, be carried to the nearest port, and would not go <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> railway at all, as the steamer freight would be so much cheaper than any rate that could be charged for carriage by the railway. On the other hand, it may be expected that there would be a considerable amount of revenue owing to local traffic and produce from the country between Port Augusta and the sand hills, which are encountered 320 miles back. </para>
                        <para>The latest report which I have received from the Tarcoola mines is a favorable one. There is also the Glenloth district, which has been reported to be extremely promising. Stock returns show that there are now 300,000 sheep grazing upon the whole district as well as 35,000 hear) of cattle and horses. Some of the country, like the tablelands country, is stated to be of a high fattening value. Were the railway made, a very great development is bound to take place in this country, and would, undoubtedly, be found capable of carrying a very much larger quantity of stock. </para>
                        <para class="block">In order to show that that is not mere assertion on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> part, I have here an official map issued by the Crown Lands Department of South Australia showing the distribution of that stock. The squares through which the proposed railway will pass are numbered 767 and 767a and a reference to the footnote attached to the map shows that in districts 767 there are 4,657 cattle, 888 horses, and 157,735 sheep; in district 767a there are 6,248 cattle, 868 horses, and 32,491 sheep; whilst in district 768 there are 15,901 cattle, 2,962 horses, and 36,411 sheep. </para>

                            <para>- Senators Givens and McColl commented strongly on the fact that this country has not been occupied. The former went so far as to say that the fact that it has not been occupied proves that it is not suitable for occupation. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> know that the land lying almost immediately to the south of Lake Gardiner was absolutely unoccupied when I left South Australia in 1892, and that in the State schools of South Australia I was taught that that country was desert, and unfit for occupation. Yet to-day South Australia is running a line of railway to branch in two directions for a distance of 150 miles from Port Lincoln into the heart of that country, and hundreds of acres of it are being taken up for agricultural purposes. </para>

                            <para>- That is even more valuable than are the honorable senator's theories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> seemed quite annoyed when he discovered last evening that the Esperance Bay railway was going to be built by the Government of Western Australia. It was one of the sheet-anchors of his opposition to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill that the Esperance Bay line would not be constructed by that State . He was proceeding to trot out the old argument, when he discovered that the Government of Western Australia have actually built half of that line, and are prepared to construct the other half. Then, he immediately seized upon the construction of that line as an argument in opposition to the building of the proposed transcontinental line. In doing so he evidenced an ingenuity of which the Senate has reason to be proud, and we all give him great credit for the facile way in which he got himself out of the difficulty. </para>

He occupies a very peculiar position on this Bill.  1  have here a volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1909, and at page 268 I find the policy of the famous Fusion Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was the representative in this Chamber, set out. I quote this paragraph from that statement of policy - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In addition to the ample provision required for Defence purposes and for the industrial projects already noticed, the outlay on the Federal Capital Site, the taking over of Ocean Lighthouses by the Commonwealth, and the construction, when authorized, of the railway line to Western Australia, have to be borne in mind. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It has to be remembered that that statement of policy by the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member was published after the survey of this line had been made. It may be said that this is a somewhat indefinite statement. When it appeared in the public press, Western Australian senators and members of another place attacked the Fusion Government in Western Australia, and complained that this was a somewhat indefinite statement. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, the Treasurer of that Government, in defending them against our attacks in Western Australia, said that that statement meant that the Fusion Government were absolutely pledged to the early construction of the line. So that, what ever construction honorable senators may put upon the statement, that is the meaning which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest said the . Government intended those words to bear. Now, nearly two years later, after the data collected by the survey have been analyzed and worked up by a competent staff, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> saying that the proper course has not been taken in regard to this line. He says, first of all, that we should get the sanction for inquiry. He admits that this was done, to a limited extent, by the passing of the Bill for the survey. Then he says that we ought to refer the material collected to a body, such as the Public Works Committee of New South Wales. I believe that the Public Works Committee of New South Wales have done very good work. I do not know in detail the nature of the work they do, but I know that the Committee is composed of politicians, and not of engineers. They inquire into the advisability of the construction of a line, and it is not, I believe, any part, of their function to work up the details collected by a survey party to enable contracts to be let for construction. I think I am safe in saying, and I hope that New South Wales senators will correct me if I am wrong, that an inquiry by the Public Works Committee of New South Wales precedes the survey of a railway. First of all, representations are made to the Government that a certain railway should be constructed, the Government bring forward a resolution to refer the project to the Public Works Committee, and, if that Committee sanction the construction of the line, then the survey is proceeded with, and the data collected by the survey are worked up to enable the expenditure of the money. What has been done in this case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should complain, or should alter the attitude which he and the Government of which he was a member took up when they published the policy statement from which I have quoted ? </para>

If his amendment be carried, it will have the effect of postponing the Bill. This Parliament, bypassing an Act, practically said, " We shall  investigate this work." It voted money for a survey, and subsequently voted more money for the payment of an expert staff to collate the material collected by the survey. </para>

                            <para>- No; the survey was completed before the Fusion Government took office. What has been done in connexion with this Bill ? The proposal was referred to a Committee, not of politicians, but of railway experts - the five Engineers-in-Chief of the mainland States of Australia. These men came to the consideration of the question with a great advantage over the politician. A politician cannot rid himself of his party associations. If the Government he supports is committed to a Bill he feels himself, to some extent, bound to back them up, right or wrong. </para>

The material collected by the survey of this route was given to a Committee of independent experts - men who know all about railway construction from A to Z ; men who have had to construct railways, who every day are dealing with these very questions, and have been specially trained and educated to deal with them. These men considered the material, analyzed and weighed every bit of it, and then presented a joint report, signed by every one of them. On that report the present Government decided to bring forward this Bill to authorize the construction df the railway, and, in order that Parliament might be seised of every detail, the Government did not stop at that. They made provision by a vote of£5,000 for the appointment of a Consulting Railway </para>

They signed a unanimous report, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moncrieff</inline> pointed out that he dissented from the recommendation as to the gauge, although the dissent is not shown in the main r.eport. I am pointing out, however, that this is an . immensely more reliable report than a report by a committee of non-experts could possibly be. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> puts forward as a justification for his amendment the statement that this should be referred to a committee for report, he refuses to accept the report of experts. </para>

We may differ in opinion as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> was wise in doing so, and every member of the Senate is free to refuse to accept his conclusions on those subjects. But I say that no matter how honorable senators, may question his testimony on those points which are outside the scope of engineering questions, they cannot affect the value of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> report on the questions affecting railway construction in any way at all. Honorable senators should bear in mind that the Government have never asked, and do not ask, that the Senate shall make up its mind on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> opinions upon any questions other than those of actual railway construction. </para>

On that point I am prepared to ask the Senate to prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> opinion to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline> We have had a strange spectacle presented by honorable senators on the other side.' They have refused to accept the joint report of five of the Engineers-in-Chief of the States of Australia, and have practically told the Governments of those States that they do not value the reports of the Engineers-in-Chief of their railway works. But at the same time, if any casual person writes a letter to a newspaper, anonymously or otherwise, they trot the letter out here and set it up against the reports of these responsible and expert officials. We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> quoting newspaper writers, and we have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> trotting out a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray.'</inline> I do not know whether he is a railway expert. I have heard that he is a mining prospector. By the way, it is singular that, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has referred to Tarcoola as a worthless mining field, this mining prospector, who appears to have been living there for years, makes a sporting offer to take a party at his own expense over the whole of the route of this railway.

                            <para>- These honorable senators do not make any specious pretext about wanting more information. They state, plainly and bluntly, that South Australia and Western Australia should build the railway, and that they have no right to ask the Commonwealth to do so. That is an honest and straightforward way of dealing with the proposal, but all those who want to oppose the Bill support the amendment. I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who is in the unfortunate position of having written a book. We all remember the old saying, " Oh that mine enemy would write a book." I hold in my hand the official rain map of South Australia for 1910, issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> A. Hunt, Commonwealth Meteorologist. Honorable senators will notice that, . wherever we are able to take records, we know the rainfall in those localities. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator presently why I am quoting the figures. In  1910,  the rainfall along the highest point of the Bight ranged from  786  points at Eucla to  890  points - that is nearly  9  inches - at Nullarbor Station, and  12  inches at Fowler Bay. </para>

                            <para>- The rainfall at Nullarbor Station - the highest point of the Bight - was  57  points below the registration for the previous year ; while the rainfall at Eucla was  233  points below the registration for the previous year. That shows that, in  1909,  Eucla had a rainfall of nearly  10  inches, and that the other places had a rainfall of over  9  inches. It also shows that Tarcoola had, in  1909,  a rainfall of over  8  inches, and in  1910,  a rainfall of  12  inches. These two points cover the country lying between Tarcoola and the western boundary. </para>

                            <para>- Tarcoola is not on the coast. If the rainfall of  8  inches extends to Tarcoola, which must be at least  150  miles from the coast, it is reasonable to assume that it covers the whole area of that line running west from Tarcoola, which is only  60  miles from the coast. If honorable senators will refer to the official rain map of Western Australia, they will observe a spot lying to the east of Norseman, and getting well up towards the line east of Kalgoorlie. In that spot, last year the rainfall was  10  inches. </para>

                            <para>- I will tell the honorable senator why I cannot give the average. Only within the last few years has there been any settlement in that particular part ; but down at Balladonia, there has been settlement fora large number of years. Dempster Brothers have a station there; and, according to their rain-gauge, the average rainfall is  12  inches. On the other hand, at Kalgoorlie, the rainfall for 1910 was  9  inches. Coming along the coast, we find that from Eucla, right away down to Israelite Bay, the rainfall last year averaged  9  inches. At Israelite Bay, which is still a long distance from Albany, the rainfall was11½ inches. The point I want to make is that there is a rainfall. The assumption from these figures - and that is where it will be interesting to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl-</inline> is that there was a rainfall of  8  inches in the area through which the proposed railway will pass. I do not think that that is an extreme statement to make, in the light of these figures. Is there any doubt about the quality of the soil ? I have been  90  miles east of Kalgoorlie, and say that, excluding the belts of mineral country, there is no better soil to be found in the whole of Australia than is to be found in the eastern gold-fields country. </para>

                            <para>- It is good red loam soil ; and if the honorable senator is a judge of soil and saw this country, I am sure that he would confirm my statement. I have been  90  miles east of Kalgoorlie, and I have met prospectors who have been out hundreds of miles, and they have told me that this quality of soil extends to the Nullarbor Plain, except, of course, where it is intersected by a mineral belt. I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> 's statement of his investigation of dry farming. In  1909  the Senate was presented with a paper on dry farming, being " a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> H. McColl of proceedings at Third Trans-Missouri Dry Farming Congress, Cheyenne, Wyoming, February,  1909,  and further investigations in America." Referring to his arrival, he says, on page  1 - "What is Dry Farming?" I inquired. "Cultivation' under low rainfall,'" was the reply. On asking where I could get particulars, I was referred to the Colorado Realty Association, Denver, where I saw sheaves of various grains of excellent quality, said to have been grown under a 12-inch rainfall. </para>

He took off the crop in July or August, and as soon as the condition of the ground would permit he ploughed, getting as deep as he could, from 6 to 8 inches. After the weeds sprouted, say, in April, he ploughed again, and kept a clean surface on the land. He used a Stockton Gang plough, five shares in each, the draught being ten horses.  His  winter sowing was done in September and October, and the spring sowing in December and January. He cropped only once in two years, leaving a summer fallow, and seeded 60 lbs. of barley and 5.5 lbs. of wheat to the acre.. He had used the White Australia wheat for the past seven years, and had never failed to get a . crop. The rainfall had been from 10 to r» inches, never over the latter. The principal rains fell in December. January, and February. The average of the farms round him was 16 bushels, but he got from 20 to 30 bushels. He rotated wheat and barley. He had not us«d manures. </para>

If he saw it done in  the United States of America, and knows that the soil of this country is good, and sees from these statistics that it has a rainfall of  8  inches, why does he refuse to open up this province to Australia ? I come now to another case. It may be said that this Was written about wheat-growing, but that everybody cannot grow wheat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was not content with wheat. Dealing with Texas, he says that the rainfall varies from  9  inches to over 40 inches, and he gives an instance of a man 20 miles north of El Paso, on the border of Texas and New Mexico, who, by dry farming, raised 2 acres of water melons averaging from 20 to 30 lbs. weight, and yielding $100 per acre. It positively makes one's mouth water! </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad that I read it; it is very informative. Assuming that these people do grow one crop in two years, that simply means that they allow one paddock to lie idle while they are cultivating another. That merely involves giving farmers a larger area than they would have in other parts of the country. It does not mean that every crop is to be a failure one year, or that there is to be no crop at all one year, and that successful crops are to be obtained in the next. It means that they practise rotation of crops.

There are people today who are taking up that land. There are people down below Norseman who are actually reaping good crops. </para>

I was brought up in the northern areas of South Australia, where the farmers considered themselves lucky if they got 10 inches of rain. We did not need a report on dry-farming to tell us that that could be done. We knew it. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wanted to show, however, and what he proved, was, that with a 10-inch rainfall under dry farming you can produce far better results than under the old system; and that even with an  8-inch  rainfall you can produce 20 bushels of wheat to the acre. An attack has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others on the water-supply report.  Not',  I challenge honorable senators opposite to dispute, the facts contained in this report. </para>

Murray as saying that the bores put down on the Nullarbor Plain had all bottomed without getting water ; and he brought that forward as an argument to prove the waterless condition 'of the country to be traversed by this line. Now, as a matter of fact, what was done was this: The Western Australian Government sent' out a trial boring party who only put down bores at intervals of a few hundred miles. They did not put clown bores to supply water, but to find whether water was there. And they did get the water. It rose 400 and 500 feet in the bores, and in one case it rose within 100 feet of the surface. Scientists to-day are able to test bore pressures, to analyze the quality of water, and to tell for what purposes it can be used. The experts give in these reports the flow that could be obtained, and they also give the fact that the water from two of the bores was fit for human consumption, which means that it was fit for boiler purposes also. In one case it was slightly brackish, but in all cases they declared it to be fit for boiler purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that there is water all along the route  of  the railway. There is an area of some hundred miles - I forget the exact distance - where there appears  to  be no water. We shall have to supply water in that area from the bores. But there is no insuperable difficulty about that. That is no reason why this railway should not be built. Even if the line went through a desert, that is no reason why it should not be built. The most profitable railways in Australia run through unoccupied country for miles. The line from Petersburg to Broken Hill for years ran through unoccupied country, but it was the best paying line South Australia had. Why ? Because there was something at the end of it. It was never built for what could be got along the route. The most payable line we had in Western Australia for many years was that from Perth to Kalgoorlie, and in its most payable days there was not a settler east of Northam. Yet to-day there are settlers 150 miles east of Northam. The railway in the days to which I refer was actually paying better than it is paying now. To-day you have a population of 300,000 people on the one side. They are - I make this statement advisedly, but not boastfully - the wealthiest people in Australia, the people who travel most of any in Australia. You have these people on the one side, and on the other you have all the rest of the population of Australia. But honorable senators opposite say that those people will not travel along the railway - that they are not going to use it. I. have told the Senate before that when I travelled on the trans-Siberian line I talked with people who came from the south of China, and who, although they have magnificent Pacific and Oriental Company steamers to take them to Europe if they like, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> India and the Suez Canal, nevertheless prefer to go overland. They used to; go by sea;,  to-day  they do not. They go on a long railway journey through China, through Manchuria, over the trans-Siberian line. They travel - how long do you think? Ten whole days right across the Continent. It is a far more costly trip than by steamer. Yet they prefer it. There is only one other point with which I wish to deal. Various railway experts on the opposite side have spoken about the cost of construction. I shall quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline><inline font-style="italic">Official Year-Book of the Commonwealth,</inline> page 713. Here we have instanced the railway from Parkes to Condobolin, 62$ miles, which cost .£2,079 per mile. The line was opened in 1898. The railway from Dubbo to Coonamble, 95 7-8th miles, cost ,£2.463 per mile. </para>

                            <para>- I come to Victoria. The line from Birchip to Cronomby, 26J miles, cost £1,548 per mile. The line from Rupanyup to Marnoo, 15 i-3rd miles, cost £1)787 per mile. The railway from Tailem Bend to Pinaroo, South Australia, 86^ miles, cost £1,470 per mile. Those instances dispose of the statement that this line is excessively costly. In any case, that point has been well disposed of by the six experts, who had before them all the necessary information about ballast, about the supply of timber, about water supply, and so forth. History has a knack of repeating itself ; and similar arguments to those which have been used against this railway have been used before. As I have been quoting from rather severe authorities, I shall conclude  by citing a passage of a lighter character from- Alfred Russell Wallace's <inline font-style="italic">Wonderful Century.</inline> I take it from page 30 of the book, where the writer deals with the history of railways. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and others will almost think that they hear themselves speaking - </para>

                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Review</inline> embodied the ideas of the educated public of the period, when it declared in 1824, that " As to those persons who speculate on making railways throughout the Kingdom, and superseding all the waggons, mails, and stage coaches,  postchaises,  and, in short, every other mode of conveyance by land and by water, we deem them, and their visionary schemes, unworthy of notice." And, again, in 1825, when it" was proposed to make a railway from London to Woolwich, and to travel on it " at twice the speed of stage coaches with greater safety," the reviewer remarked : " We should as soon expect the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one of  Congrieve's <inline font-style="italic">ricochet</inline> rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy of such a machine going at such a rate." </para>

"And," they concluded, '* it would be the greatest nuisance, the most complete disturbance of quiet comfort in all parts of the Kingdom, that the ingenuity of man could invent."

                            <para>-  I desire to make a personal explanation. I have to complain that the Minister of Defence, during the course of his remarks - I hope unconsciously - misrepresented what I said in debating the motion for the second reading of this Bill. I do not think it is fair that such misrepresentation should be allowed to go uncontradicted. The Minister stated that I was visibly disappointed when I was informed that it was the intention of the Western Australian Government to complete the railway, which was already half built, from Kalgoorlie to Esperance Bay. Such a statement was grossly unfair, seeing that at the time the information was imparted to me, I expressed both pleasure and gratification at the news. I admit that I did not express any gratification that the railway had been constructed only half way to Esperance Bay, because I recognised that it had been built, not for the purpose of opening up communication with the sea coast for the benefit of the residents of the gold-fields', but for the purpose of dragging more of the trade of those fields to Perth and Fremantle to be an additional source of profit to property owners and traders there and consequent satisfaction to the Minister who represents them. </para>

                <para class="block">In moving for leave to introduce this Bill, I may say that I did not expect the Government to give the evening to private members' business, and consequently, even if my motion be carried, I have not the Bill ready to present to the Senate. But as the opportunities for submitting such a motion cannot occur very frequently during the remainder of this session, I take advantage of this occasion to ask permission to introduce this Bill. If it is granted I shall have the Bill prepared and bring it before the Senate later. I intend to be quite open and fair in the matter, and I say at once that my object is to amend section  57  of the principal Act for the purpose of depriving the  Deputy  Postmaster-General and his officers of what I consider the dangerous power which they at present possess to open and interfere with private correspondence. We are all aware that the Parliament of Tasmania has legalized the carrying on of certain sweeps, and the departmental prohibition of correspondence addressed to a certain institution in Tasmania has been the cause of very considerable inconvenience to many business people. Postal notes taken out, for instance, in New South Wales, are returned to the people who took them out, and they are put to very great trouble in cashing them, as they are frequently made payable to certain banking institutions. I have publicly stated that, in my opinion, it. is not the duty of the authorities of the Post and Telegraph Department to interfere in any way with private, correspondence going through the Post Office. I draw a line distinctly between interference with correspondence passing  thorough  the- Post Office and addressed to business institution's, and interference with the circulation through the Post Office of pernicious literature, for instance; The Bill "I propose to introduce will be framed with; the object of taking out of thehandsofthePostmasterGeneral and his officers the power they now exercise of opening and interfering with correspondence chiefly directed to certain persons who are conducting "a business legally in Tasmania at the present time. I want the Senate to express the opinion that the business of the Post and Telegraph Department shall not be, so conducted that letters properly stamped may  be  opened or interfered with in any way. I presume that there may be some opposition to what I propose on. the ground that the interference of whichIcomplain has been permitted under the law with the object of preserving the morality of the community. I may say- in reply that if we are going to strain the powers of the postal authorities to enable them in this  very  doubtful way to improve the morality of the people, it may be contended that we should refuse to permit certain persons , to travel on the Commonwealth railways when we have constructed them. I venture to say that the Governments of the various States are quite as much interested in the morality of the people as is the Commonwealth Government. Yet we find that they give the people every possible facility to attend race meetings. </para>

                        <para>- If members of Parliament did not do so they would cease to be representative men. If I am asked what the result of this postal interference on behalf of the morality of the people has been, I should say that it has been <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> Glancing through a newspaper recently I found that Tattersall's Sweeps on the last Melbourne Cup, including special No.  1,  and special No.  2,  were all -filled. It is possible that the Ministercalled upon to, administer the Post -and Telegraph Department may under the existing law have to administer a provision in this respect with which he does, not agree. I feel sure, however, that the Postmaster-General who preceded the present occupant of the office, believed that in interfering in that direction he was conserving the morality of the people by preventing persons investing in Tattersall's Sweeps. I believe that that gentleman conscientiously felt that to be his duty. I do not know anything of the views in this connexion of the present occupant of the office nor do I desire to know anything of them. am asking. the Senate to. give me permission to introduce a Bill to provide that the PostmasterGeneraland his officers shall no ,  longer have the right to open any sealed correspondence of the character to which I have referred. I do not wish to take from them the right to prevent the circulation of pernicious literature. Ishould, like, however, to ask those who claim that they ought to have the right to interfere in this way in the interests of the morality of the people, how they can justify the circulation through the Post Office. of newspapers which certainly no member of the Senate would give to any member of his family to read? I feel that I shall have no difficulty in obtaining leave to introduce the Bill to which I have referred, in order that its merits may be discussed on the second reading. I wish the Senate to decide that the Post and Telegraph Department in this matter shall be conducted on the same lines as a private business. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel it somewhat difficult to bring back honorable senators' minds from the question of the Western Australian railway and Tattersall's Sweeps to that of the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services. Important as Have been the discussions on the transcontinental railway, and the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for leave to introduce a Bill, I think that die report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services is equally worthy of our very serious consideration. It is about eight weeks since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie moved that it be approved by the Senate. Let me here extend my congratulations to the members of the Royal Commission for the splendid and very able report which they have made, so comprehensive in its nature, and dealing with every aspect of the Postal Service. At the same time, I want to single out those members of the Royal Commission who, despite the hostile and malignant criticism of the press, stuck to their posts. I venture to say that since the inception of Federation no Royal Commission has been subject to such bitter criticism as has the Royal Commission on Postal Services. So bitter was that criticism that we found some of its original members resigning their positions, lest they might be injured in another way. I wish to specially mention the fact that the Royal Commission included men who were determined to see the inquiry through to a finish: We are now in possession of a report so comprehensive in its nature that it has enabled the members of this Parliament to see where the weak spots in the Postal Service are. I might also say that since the presentation of the report t the Government of the day have endeavoured - and endeavoured successfully - to meet many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission. There are still, however, some defects in the Postal Service which we may be able to rectify, and it is with that intention that I am addressing myself to this motion to-night. Last session, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in reply to a question I asked, made a promise to the Senate. that ample .time would be given for the discussion of this report. I am aware that he, as Leader of the Senate, has been good enough to extend the time for the discussion of private business by one night. Notwithstanding that extension, I venture to say that the ample time which he promised last session to afford has not been given for the discussion of a report of this nature. Whilst I recognise that the Government have extended the facilities for dealing with private business by a night, I still contend that this report deserves more time for its consideration than has been allowed up to the present. </para>

                        <para>- However, we must content ourselves with the opportunity which is offered. Perhaps it is somewhat unique that the report is being discussed at all. Royal Commissions sit and present reports, but usually the reports are shelved. The Royal Commission on Postal Services has had a chance to get its report discussed by members of this Parliament. There is one feature to which I desire to refer, and that is that when the Royal Commission was sitting evidence was called for. Every, employe in the Postal Service had an opportunity of appearing as a witness, and the Public Service Commissioner had a similar opportunity.' The point I want to make and I think it is a just one, is that after; he, and his employes, had that opportunity,' we are to-day presented with a report from him reviewing the evidence given by a section of the Postal Service. I am not questioning his right in one way, but -in another I am. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> is today the Public Service Commissioner, and whilst to a certain extent he is really the autocrat of the Public Service, he is also an employé of the Commonwealth Government. And to give him the opportunity to present this report, while the mouths of his employes were closed, was, to say the least of it, unfair. He gave his evidence on oath, and so did the men over whom he has the ruling hand. I think that the matter should have ended when the Royal Commission presented its report. But, after the evidence had been taken on oath from both sides, and the Royal Commission had drawn its deductions and presented its report, we find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> coming in with another reply, and no opportunity given to the men whose evidence he, according to this report, entirely condemns. I could understand this being done if 4 chance had been given to both sides. It is well known that, according to the law which dominates the Public Service, it is unlawful for any section of the Public Service to circularize members of Parliament, but the employer of the Public Service can do that <inline font-style="italic">ad lib.</inline> ' What I want to emphasize is the evidence given in connexion with the sorters. In a memorandum by the Public Service Commissioner relating to recommendations of the Royal Commission, and presented to the Senate on the  15th  September,  1911,  I find the following paragraph :  - </para>

                    <para>It was pointed out in evidence by the Public Service Commissioner that while that rate purports to be the maximum attainable by sorters in New Zealand, it is not as a matter of practice paid, and that 45 per cent. of Dominion sorters were receiving less than the minimum of an Australian softer, while the average salary in the Commonwealth was£14 higher than in New Zealand. Despite the definite statement of the actual position of sorters in New Zealand, the Royal Commission reported (para. 383) that " from an examination of the New Zealand Post and Telegraph Departmental List, 1908-9, your Commissioners discovered that a number of sorters now in receipt of£180 will reach the maximum of£200 per annum, in accordance with the Post and Telegraph Classification Act 1907. This Act came into force in April,1908, and provides that officers in the Non-Clerical Division mav advance from £50 to£200 per annum in fifteen years by £10 increments." </para>

                <para class="block">It must be further borne in mind that even since the Royal Commission presented its report the cost of living has increased. Even if the Government and the Parliament accepted <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> the report, thai would not meet the situation. I see that, in connexion with the cost of living, it is estimated, from official figures, that the purchasing power of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> in  1904  was reduced to  16s. 3d.  in  191 1.  A salary of£190 in  1904  is only equal to £154  7s. 6d.  in  191 1.  A despatching officer in receipt of£100 in  1911  received an equivalent of <inline font-style="italic">£162</inline> 10s.  in  1904.  It may be added that the State of Victoria increased the pay of all members of the Police Force who had had fifteen years' service1s. per day, or <inline font-style="italic">£18</inline> 5s.  per annum; and those who had had less than fifteen years' service were increased  6d.  per day, or£9  2s. 6d.  per annum. In South Australia, increases were also granted in consequence of the increased cost of living. There, again, I point out that, even if the Commissioner was correct in his estimate, and even if the full report of the Royal Commission was accepted, still, the recommendations fall short of the necessary remuneration to the men employed. The Royal Commission recommended that a board" of control or management should be appointed. That raises a very vexed question. For my own part, I support the recommendation. I consider that our Postal Service is too big for one man to administer it. But, not only has the Commissioner to administer this service, but also the Customs and the Defence Departments. There is no man breathing who is capable of grappling with the various problems that present themselves in. connexion  with all those Departments. View the matter from whatever stand-point honorable senators choose, we can only come to the conclusion that, unless we adopt the recommendations of the Royal Commission, our Postal Service will not reflect credit upon Australia. It is true that we have reduced the price of telegrams and adopted penny postage. It is true that, in many respects, the Commonwealth Postal Service is exemplary. But it is also true that it is wanting in other respects ; and it -is because of the  unwieldly  nature of the service, and the fact that one man has to govern it and other services, that there is a weak link in the chain. I do not advocate political control, but I do desire that every one of our services shall be properly and ably administered. I do not reflect, in the slightest degree, on the personal ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan;</inline> quite the contrary. He may be a Napoleon in his way, but the Postal Service has proved to be too big for him. That is the reason why I think we should centre the administration in a board of control. We must remember that at present there is no appeal beyond the Public Service Commissioner. No man dare say him nay, be he member of Parliament, Minister, or employe. It is high time that such a state of things was remedied. The only way that 1 can see for remedying it is to accept the recommendation relating to the establishment of a board of control. The Government of the day have brought down a Bill, the intention of which is to give public servants the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court. I welcome that project, and hope that it will become law. lt has been said that the postal servants are not desirous of appealing to the Arbitration Court. That may or may not be correct. But, claiming to have a wide knowledge of the postal servants of Australia, I venture to say that, if their own wishes were consulted, we should find that the majority of them were anxious to have this power of appeal. I refer particularly to the general division. I have no desire to see any privileged class established in Australia; and whilst we have one law tor workers outside the Public Service, we should not have another law for those within  it. I believe that the present Government are considering the pensions phase of the question. </para>

                        <para>- There is a desire to legislate on the subject, which I think will receive favorable consideration from the Government. In conclusion, I shall mention only one other point. It was not fair to a section of the Postal Service that the Public Service Commissioner should have issued a final reply when the lips of the members of the Commission were sealed. I cannot lay too much emphasis on that point. If 1 were to consult the dictionary, the only word which I could find to describe such conduct would be the word " despicable." I am satisfied that, in the hands of the present Government, the intentions of the Royal Commission will be honorably and faithfully observed. So far, the Government have met them, lt is their intention to go further. Our public servants must have the same freedom of thought and speech as the man who is today their autocrat; and I hope that the day is not far distant when the powers vested in him will be taken away, and when more power will be given to "Parliament and to the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> in recognising the work done by the Postal Commission. No Commission of which I have any knowledge has sat so long, made such exhaustive inquiries, or presented so full a report and recommendations as this Commission has done. I should have preferred that the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had not committed us to an absolute indorsement of every recommendation. When the adoption of a report was moved in another place, the words, " in a general sense," were used. It would have been better if those words had been adopted in the motion before us. A number of the recommendations have already been acted upon. Probably we shall all admit that it is impossible to carry out others. Generally speaking, however, the recommendations are sound, and have been submitted with a genuine desire to improve the service. I wish to address myself to one or two matters only. One has reference to those public servants who came over from the State service to the Commonwealth. They were transferred with the full assurance that no officer would lose his rights or his accruing rights.  More than that, any one who reads the debates of the Convention, will find that very great stress was laid upon this point. It was recognised that if the public servants did not feel sure that their rights would be conserved under the Commonwealth, they might refuse to vote for Federation, and their influence through- out the Commonwealth might be large enough to defeat the carrying of the referendum upon the Commonwealth Bill itself. I do think; that some of those officers! and especially some of the South Australian officers, have been shamefully used in this respect. They have cause for very serious complaint in regard to the treatment which they have received. I notice that their case was put before the Commission in very clear terms, and I am sorry that the conclusion at which that body arrived was not more favorable to them. Their case is thus put upon page 65 of the Postal Commission's report - </para>

Officers were assured before Federation that the Constitution effectively preserved rights accrued and accruing, but the compact was  broken by the Commonwealth authorities in every instance, except in the matter of retiring allowances. Consequently, a very large proportion of the South Australian officers have suffered monetary losses ranging from <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> to£150 per annum, and. loss of status to such an extent that in some cases postmasters with thirty-five and forty years' service are junior to officers who served under them as messengers. </para>

                <para>That is a point which I wish to emphasize. The emoluments which they received in excess of their salaries were not gratuities. Had they been, these officers would have been placed in a very unsatisfactory position so far as the rest of the service was concerned. More than that it was made abundantly clear by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd that these emoluments were not gratuities, but were regarded as part of the statutory salaries. ' </para>
                <para>Under the State, the officers in question were remunerated partly by statutory salary., and partly by sundry emoluments, such as Savings Bank salary, rebate on sale of stamps, and free quarters, which were regarded as part of their salaries. </para>

                <para class="block">So that the amount involved was not a very serious one after all. I would also point out that the existing and accruing rights which should have been preserved to transferred officers, would have been confined to a gradually decreasing number. One of these officers, the late John Bastard, who suffered more than did anybody else, died some years ago. Others.  such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder,</inline> have retired from the service.

It is a very bad thing for any Government to break faith with their servants. Such an act creates dissatisfaction, just as in the South Australian branch of the Post and Telegraph Department it has created very serious discontent. This dissatisfaction has been simmering in the minds of these officers for years, and I think they have very just cause to complain of their failure to receive that consideration which was due to them. They are in a position to say, " We were transferred to the Commonwealth Service with the full assurance that all our rights would be preserved. Those conditions have not. been complied with, and as a result we are suffering seriously to-day." I should have been glad if the Commission had been able to recommend parliamentary action with a view to abolishing this dissatisfaction, and doing justice to some 200 men. Another very important recommendation made by the Commission relates to the establishment pf a board of management. I am thoroughly in accord with that recommendation, which reads - </para>

                <para class="block">I do not wish to say a single word in depreciation of the Public Service Commissioner. I believe, from what I have seen and heard of that gentleman, that he is a very capable, conscientious officer, who endeavours to discharge his duties impartially. But the Postal Service is a very large one. It is divided into two branches the postal on the one hand, and the telegraphic and' telephonic branches on the other. It is almost impossible for one man to thoroughly grasp and efficiently administer the whole of this vast service. I am quite sure that the officers generally would be satisfied if an expert were appointed , to control the Postal Branch of the . service,, and it ought not to be impossible to select from the large number of officers available, a man of high qualifications, and one . who would enjoy the complete confidence of that division of the service. On the. other hand, we might take a man from the Telegraph and Telephone Branches equally high in his own. profession, and possessing in an equal degree the confidence of the officers of those branches, and we might then put the Public Service Commissioner, or some other man, at their head, and give these officers a voice in the management of this great Department. If I can lay any grievance I. have before a man who understands my trade, and all the conditions surrounding it, I can at least be sure that he will thoroughly understand my complaint, will be able to accept any suggestion I make, or give a valid reason why he does not accept it. I believe that the servants of this Department would have a feeling of much greater confidence if they could be sure that in connexion with its management there was a man thoroughly conversant with the whole of the details of their work. They would know that if their grievances were put before him he would be able to understand them, and would probably consider them sympathetically. I mean by that to say that he would desire to do what was right, not only in the interests of the Commonwealth, but also in the interests of the servants of the Department. I am very glad that the Postal Commission have made this recommendation. I believe it to be worthy of consideration and adoption. There is one matter in connexion with this recommendation upon which I am not quite clear. It is suggested that provision should be made for an appeal from any decision of the proposed board of management. I understand that the servants of the Department all desire that even if the proposed board be appointed, they should have a right of appeal from the decisions of the board. I say frankly that I am not quite sure as to what authority could be set up which would satisfy them on appeal, if they were dissatisfied with the decisions of the board. There is another matter which is the cause of dissatisfaction in the service, and it is connected with the practice of examinations for promotion. I dare say that in many cases examinations are very good things. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But there are occasions when they work a good deal of injustice to men who have been long years in the service. There are men who know the practical details of the service from A to Z. But if you set them down at a table and ask them to answer questions in a literary fashion, they may not be able to do so as well as a young fellow who has just come from school or college. I had brought under my notice only a little time ago the case of two men who were line foremen, and desired to apply for a vacancy for a line inspector. These men had served for twenty and twenty-two years respectively as line foremen. They had also, on occasion, done the work of line inspector so satisfactorily as to secure the commendation of their superior officers. Naturally, they thought that the way was open to them to step up from the position of line foremen to that of line inspector. But they were suddenly confronted with the fact that they must pass an examination. I do not wonder that -such men should feel that it is hardly fair that they should be expected to pass an examination when they had the whole of the practical work at their fingers-ends, had satisfactorily carried it out for years, and were capable of taking up the duties of the superior position. I do not think that such men should' he asked to pass an academic examination in which they may fail, while a younger man with scarcely any practical experience may pass and secure a position over their heads. I believe that I am right in saying that there have been cases where, as the result of examinations, younger men have been put over the heads of practical men who have been many yea rj in the service, and when difficulty has arisen, and the man possessing the theoretical knowledge has been unable to do the work, the practical men, over whose head he has been appointed, have had to be called to do it for him. I do not think that that is a state of things which ought 'to exist. Whilst I am not averse to examinations in a general sense, I do think that men who have rendered long years of service, and are capable of doing the work required of them, should not be subjected to examinations of that sort, and to the possibility of losing status by having a junior passed over their heads. </para>

                        <para>- I may be wrong about that. But, in my opinion, other things being equal, the man with seniority should receive promotion. I do not say that a man should go up in the service simply because he is senior to others. If he is an inefficient man, he ought not to expect to be preferred to a man better qualified for promotion. It is no injustice to an inefficient man to put over his head a man possessing more merit. I think the Government might very well take this matter into consideration, and modify the provision with respect to examination to such an extent as to secure that men who have been long in the service, have acquitted themselves well, and done their work satisfactorily, shall not lose the result of their years of labour simply because they are unable to pass academic tests. There is another matter which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and that is the suggested superannuation fund. I mean by a superannuation fund a fund to which the officers of the service shall be obliged to contribute, and, having done so, shall have the right to claim certain benefits in certain cases. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. We have such a system in operation in South Australia. There is a superannuation fund there, which is under the control of the service itself. The officers have to contribute to the fund according to the salary they receive, and, in certain cases, they get relief from that fund, and. on retiring, receive a superannuation allowance of so much for each year of service. I believe that the establishment of such a fund in connexion with this Department would give satisfaction throughout the service. A man would then know, on entering the service as a young man, that if he served for thirty or forty years, when he reached the age of sixty-five and would be obliged to retire, although he might be still capable of service, he could fall back upon the fund to which he had contributed, and from which he would have a perfect right to receive a yearly amount to prevent his falling into destitute circumstances, or even having to apply for an old-age pension. There are some other matters, especially connected with buildings, to which I should like to have referred, but, as it is growing so late, I do not wish to keep honorable senators longer. An opportunity may be afforded to discuss one or two matters in connexion with the Postal Commission's report later on, and I shall therefore say no more at the present time. I wish to repeat, however, that I hope something will be done for the South Australian officers to whom I have referred, and that, so far as the control of this service is concerned, serious consideration will be given to the recommendation of the Commission, and some scheme devised which will give general satisfaction. </para>

But I should like to submit the motion which has been standing in my name on the business-paper for some weeks. Paragraph 23 of section 51 of the Constitution provides that this Parliament shall have the power to legislate for the payment of invalid and old- age pensions. If my amendment were carried, and acted upon, it would involve merely the inclusion of the word "widows" in the paragraph referred to. The passing of this motion will commit the Senate to nothing. If it be carried here and in another place, I take it that it will be regarded as an instruction to the Government to bring down a Bill within the statutory time before the close of the last session of this Parliament to provide for the taking of a referendum of the people on the question whether section 51 of the Constitution should be altered as I propose. . As the section stands, it gives this Parliament power only to pass legislation granting invalid and old-age pensions. Legislation has already been passed under section 51 for the payment of pensions to persons who have reached a certain age, and also under certain conditions to invalids. My desire is that that section of the Constitution shall be so enlarged that this Parliament will have the power to provide for the payment of pensions to widows, irrespective of age, and that is how my motion is worded. Of course, I do not mean to suggest the payment of pensions to all widows, but that it should be in the power of this Parliament to provide for the payment of pensions to widows in certain conditions analogous to those which now surround the payment of pensions to persons of a certain age and to invalids. If this motion were carried, and it were desired by a majority of each House of this Parliament that this provision should be made, it would still be necessary to get the consent of the people of Australia, which, of course, could only be obtained by  means  of a referendum. If my motion were carried, I would follow it up, within the prescribed time laid down in the Constitution, by asking, next session, for leave to bring in a Bill to refer the matter to the people at the next general election. It is hardly worth while to go into the merits of the question to-night, but I may mention that, since I placed the motion On the notice-paper, I have learned, through the daily press, that New Zealand, which' was, I believe, the first British country to pass an Old-age Pensions Act, proposes to extend the principle of pensions in the direction indicated in my motion. I have read that notice has been given by the New Zealand Government of their intention to bring in a Bill to extend the principle of paying pensions to widows under certain conditions j and the conditions outlined in the necessarily brief notice which we get in the  press were similar to those which I had in my mind. My idea is that, if it is necessary that men and women of a certain age, and invalids, should be able to demand a pension, not as a charity, but as a right, there is equal justification for widows who are left penniless and with children of tender years to support, to draw some weekly or monthly payment from the Commonwealth or State Treasury. No doubt every honorable senator, in travelling through his own State or through Australia, has frequently come across cases of very great hardship - cases in which widows have been left penniless, and with two, or three, Or half-a-dozen young children, not one of whom is able to earn anything. These widows, if they have not any relatives or friends who are able to assist them, are thrown on the charity of their kindly neighbours, or on the charity of the State. I know that it will be argued in some quarters that it might be better for this Parliament to leave each State to provide for such cases than to seek this power from the people. But the very same argument was used, and could be used just as properly, when the question of granting old-age and invalid pensions was first brought before the country. There is equal justification for the payment of a small sum from the Commonwealth or State Treasury to widows who are left with young children in .indigent circumstances. This is not the right time to discuss the amount of the pension. What  1  desire is that the people shall have an opportunity of saying whether or not this Parliament shall have the power to legislate in this direction. </para>

All these, however, - are matters of detail which would necessarily have to be dealt with in the Bill which would have to be passed after the Constitution had been altered, by inserting the words ' ' and widows ' ' in paragraph 23 of section 51. The Parliament would then have the power to grant pensions to widows in certain conditions. </para>

I feel thoroughly satisfied that there will be a majority in each House of this Parliament in favour of taking a referendum on this subject. It has been argued, many and many a time, that our legislative power in regard to old-age and invalid pensions could be better exercised by the States, owing, perhaps, to the varying conditions which obtain. But the argument which was used to combat that argument might be used in connexion with my motion. </para>

                        <para>- That might well be left to the Government, and it would be a very simple matter to deal with. What I wish to get affirmed now is a great human principle. I am quite satisfied that every member of this Parliament has in his mind a number of instances where splendid citizenesses - women of the finest type, and mothers of young families - have been thrown upon the world, and have to depend entirely on the charity of their neighbours, or the State, or a local body. This is a matter which I think could be dealt with better by the Commonwealth as a whole than by a particular State. I do not mean to suggest that the States do not provide in a more or less haphazard way for these cases. But they only provide for individual cases. In Tasmania individual cases have been dealt with by the State Government, only under compulsion - only when a number of friends have represented that something ought to be done. It is not satisfactory to the recipients of the State relief that they should be dependent entirely on the whim of the Government. I have tried to get something to guide me in the matter, but I do not think that there is any British country which has legislation providing for the payment of pensions to widows in these conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Since I placed this motion on the business-paper, New Zealand has taken some steps. I do not know whether a Bill has been brought before the Dominion Parliament, but f know that some weeks ago a proposition was made that a widow should be allowed a certain sum for each child under a certain age up to four or five children. I am not going into details to-night. As the hour is late, I ask the Minister whether he has any objection to allowing' rae to continue my remarks on Thursday next. </para>

                    <para>. - May I suggest that if the pressure of public business prevents <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> from proceeding with this question during the present session, my honorable friend should endeavour to obtain from the Government (an assurance that their sympathy io in favour of his motion, and that they will take action in .the matter? lt that were so, the Government might at the next election submit a referendum question to the electors for an alteration of the Constitution to enable Parliament to legislate. The exact form in which the question should be submitted might be safely left to the Government. Having once obtained the power, Parliament could exercise it if and as it chose. I venture to say that if the motion were pressed to a division, that there would be but one opinion as to making some such provision as that moved for. If the Government would give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> an assurance that they are willing to take the course that has been indicated, he would achieve his object, no matter if the pressure of business crowded out a further discussion of the subject this session. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has said, in reply to interjections, he is not so much concerned about the exact form in which the constitutional amendment is framed, believing that the subject can be safely left to the Government and the Crown Law officers to draft what is required in proper form. They would know exactly what was aimed at. If the people of Australia approved of an alteration of the Constitution, it would be for Parliament to determine what subsequent action should be taken. I  agree  entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> object. The amount granted to widows might be a pittance in the sense that it would be a small sum; but at the same time it would not be a matter of charity or sympathy. Widows would be treated exactly as the Commonwealth now treats invalids and persons of old age. </para>

                    <para>. - It is rather a difficult matter to reply to the question which has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> It must be recognised that the matter contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> motion must be submitted to the Treasurer, who will inquire in'to it. Then the Government would have to take it into consideration. It is impossible off-hand for me to make any statement such as has been suggested.
