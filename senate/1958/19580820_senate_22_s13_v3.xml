                        <para>-  Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General inform the Senate whether it is a fact that a recent application for salary increases by senior officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was heard by the Public Service Arbitrator in the board room of the commission in Sydney instead of in one of the conference rooms of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? Is it also a tact that no representatives of the press or members of the public attended the hearing? Is it further a fact that Mr. Moses, the general manager of the commission, argued the case against salary increases, and that the arbitrator rebuked him several times for his hostile attitude towards the witnesses? Will the Minister table the transcript of evidence taken at the hearing, for the information of honorable senators? Will the Minister also direct the commission that there is to be no victimization of any member of the commission's staff as a result of evidence given before the arbitrator for higher salaries? </para>

                        <para>-  I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has he read item 150, at page 101, of the Auditor-General's report, in which reference is made to a government airline - presumably, Trans-Australia Airlines - and the accumulation of large sums of money for unused travel tickets? Does the lack of reference to any privately operated airline indicate that no similar problem exists in relation to it and that the great bulk of airline passengers using govern ment vouchers travel by T.A.A.? If this is so, could it indicate that this Government's policy of giving freedom of choice to voucher holders as to which airline they may travel by has not been widely  and  continually made known within the Commonwealth Public Service, the armed services and business undertakings? Will the Government ensure that its policy of freedom of choice is widely publicized? </para>

                        <para>-  I have not read the Auditor-General's report but I have seen press reports about the matter to which the honorable senator has referred. I read the press reports with more than passing interest. They referred specifically to government airlines, so I assume that only government airlines were involved. As to what action should be taken, I do not know. The Government has, I think, made it more than plain that it is a matter entirely for the passenger to choose the airline by which he is to travel. For my part,  I  nominate and make plain the airline by which I wish to travel. I think the remedy is for each public servant and member  of  Parliament to do the same thing. </para>

                        <para>-I preface my question to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General by stating that some time ago I asked a question regarding the possibility of direct telecasts to Canberra from Sydney. At that time, in view of the direct reception of television in Sydney from Canberra during the Queen Mother's visit, I asked whether the Government would explore the possibility  of  making permanent television reception available to Canberra and the surrounding areas coming within the scope of reception. Since then, I have been informed by technicians that permanent reception could be obtained by the erection of relay or booster masts at a cost of something less than Â£200,000, which amount would soon be recouped by the revenue received from the thousands of new licences which would be taken out. I now ask whether the Government has pursued the question of arranging television reception in Canberra. If so. with what result? If not, will the Government make the necessary investigations? I understand that very soon there will be an influx of public servants from Melbourne who are accustomed to television, and naturally, in addition, it would be a great boon for the residents of Canberra and the surrounding areas if television reception were possible in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

Is it a fact that recently an agreement was reached between the Commonwealth Government, the United Kingdom Government and mining companies' operating in the South Alligator River field, for the sale of a' substantial quantity of uranium oxide at a good commercial price? Can the Minister advise whether the price of uranium oxide has fallen over the last two years? If so, what is the percentage of the fall? What is the position in respect of other companies anxious to produce uranium oxide in Australia? Can they go ahead confidently, believing that the whole of their production of this mineral will be sold at satisfactory commercial prices? </para>

                        <para>- It is true that a contract was recently completed between the mining company operating on the South Alligator River and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Commission. The price at which the uranium will be sold is a matter between the vendor and the purchaser, and does not concern the Commonwealth Government, nor is it within the Government's province to make any statements or give any information about it. This is an ordinary commercial contract, and it is the business of the parties. It is true that the price of uranium oxide on a world parity basis has fallen, but I would not be willing offhand to attempt to estimate the extent of the fall. </para>

                    <para>As to other companies anxious to produce uranium oxide, the Commonwealth Government is encouraging in every way possible the search for uranium. We should like to see more large-size deposits discovered. At this stage I cannot state what arrangements will be made for its purchase, or whether the Government will guarantee to purchase up to a certain amount, but I give the assurance that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission will do everything it can to help any one who discovers a good uranium deposit. </para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is he aware that Vickers Viscount aircraft with which Trans-Australia Airlines is almost fully equipped have met with great success, as is proved by the popular support they have been given? Is he aware that many T.A.A. flights using the Viscount are completely booked out and that overflow traffic is passed on to other airlines by the T.A.A. staff? I might mention that I have been unable to get a booking on a T.A.A. Viscount on the last three occasions when I have travelled from Launceston to Melbourne on my trips to Canberra. Will the Minister have inquiries made to find out whether T.A.A. can handle, with its present limited fleet of Viscounts, the business available to it? If it cannot, will the Government allow T.A.A. to order more Viscounts and so give the general public the right to choose the type of aircraft in which they fly? </para>

                        <para>- On 6th August, Senator Hendrickson, referring to a question addressed to me on 11th March last regarding the distribution of the Australian Encyclopaedia, asked me to take the matter up with the Minister for External Affairs. In reply to Senator Hendrickson's question on 11th March, I promised to make representations to the departments concerned with the supply of the Australian Encyclopaedia to the places suggested by the honorable senator. This has been done, with the following result:- </para>

                        <para>-I should  like to direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. It relates to the contentious subject of the law of the sea. I have previously asked questions relating to the continental shelf and allied matters, and the answers given have indicated that the Australian Government adheres to the antiquated 3-mile limit, although most other nations disagree with that point of view. Some months ago two Victorian fishermen were fined Â£50 each because they were fishing outside the 3-mile limit. That appears to me to be somewhat of a contradiction. At the recent Geneva Convention no proposal relating to the breadth of territorial waters was adopted. In view of the discussions which took place, and of </para>

Will the Government, when selecting representatives to attend conferences of this character, which consider such subjects as safety at sea, registration of shipping, the pollution of the sea and the laying of cables and pipe lines on the sea bed, include in the delegations legal officers, representatives of shipowners and representatives of maritime unions, who possess a profound knowledge of these subjects? </para>

Because a man is a good practical fisherman, it does not mean that he would be a valuable man to have at a fisheries conference where highly technical matters are discussed. At the conference to which the honorable senator has referred we were very strongly represented by the Solicitor-General. </para>

To make that comprehensible, it is necessary for me, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, to</inline> take you to happenings in the Senate yesterday when debate was proceeding on a motion that certain papers be printed. The papers in question represented a statement made by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> and repeated in this chamber by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan).</inline> The statement largely concerned itself with the international crisis in the Middle East. That whole debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> it is necessary to understand, was highlighted by references to the threat that was poised by international communism at world peace and at the democracies, and that theme pervaded the whole of the debate. With that introduction, perhaps I may recount very briefly the events that led to the motion. </para><para>I quote from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> during which, at one stage, he said - </para><quote><para>If we are not prepared to employ armed force to keep the Middle East clear of Communists, we should say so now and get out, because I firmly believe that the only solution to preservation of peace in the Middle East is a good bayonet with a rifle on the end of it. </para></quote><para>At that stage of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> speech he was interrupted by an interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> who said, " The old sabre rattler! " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> then replied - </para><quote><para>That is called sabre rattling by interjectors like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> who preaches the Communist doctrine in this Senate at every possible opportunity. </para></quote><para>Objection to that remark was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> who asked that it be withdrawn.

First, I want to examine its literal meaning. Next, I should like to state what I consider to be the proper inferences to be drawn from the statement. Then I propose to invite the Senate to look at the international background and the run of current events in which that statement was made, in order to put the statement in its proper context. </para><para>When it is said of an honorable senator that he preaches the Communist doctrine in this Senate at every possible opportunity, that plainly means what it says. It means that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> takes, not some opportunities, not frequent opportunities, but every possible opportunity to preach, and the word "preach" has an implication of advocacy, and of urgency. He takes the opportunity to preach what? He takes the opportunity to preach the Communist doctrine, not any part of it, but the whole of the Communist doctrine. I am not referring now to what, in my view, was in Senator's Vincent mind, but that is plainly the literal meaning of the words used. </para><para>I turn now to the second point  -  the proper inferences to be drawn from a statement of that kind. While I detail them, I am not suggesting that all or any of them were in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> mind when he made the statement that he did and which I have just quoted. At least that statement means that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> was doing the work of the Communists in so preaching communism from this high platform at every possible opportunity. I submit that is a proper inference to be drawn from the statement. I think it is a proper inference flowing from that, accordingly, that he is a Communist. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>101</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PEARSON, Rex</name><name role="display">Senator Pearson</name></talker><para>-  No. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>101</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCKENNA, Nicholas</name><name role="display">Senator McKENNA</name></talker><para>-  I suggest that is a proper inference to be drawn from the fact that he takes every opportunity in this chamber to preach the Communist doctrine.

The honorable senator has just interjected that I am drawing on my imagination when I point out that an inference to be drawn from the promulgation of the Communist doctrine is the overthrow of society by revolution. Surely that is the Communist doctrine. Surely it is the first plank in the Communist doctrine. The Communists do not believe in proceeding by evolutionary or constitutional means; they are openly revolutionary in their approach to achieving their ends. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>102</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PEARSON, Rex</name><name role="display">Senator Pearson</name></talker><para>-  There was never any suggestion of that. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>102</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCKENNA, Nicholas</name><name role="display">Senator McKENNA</name></talker><para>- Not in actual words, but when an honorable senator is presented in this chamber as advancing or preaching - preaching is a much stronger word than merely advancing - the Communist doctrine, and no exception is made with respect to any particular part of the doctrine, then it relates to the whole of the doctrine, and that doctrine at least includes revolution. It plainly includes revolution. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I am putting this as a logical argument; I am not seeking to be imaginative, and I submit that any honorable senator who listens to me with objectivity must concede that the Communist doctrine does include, first, revolution, and secondly, the destruction of religion, which, in other words, means atheism, or the destruction of all that Christianity stands for. Those are the two main elements. There -is no need for me 'to pick out any -elements other than those two in order to demonstrate how exceedingly serious an allegation of -this nature can be to anybody who addresses his mind objectively to 'it. In view of all the talk of indirect aggression by the 'Communists - and that communism exists all over the world is not denied - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is accused of being part of the softening up process - part of the advocacy of the cause of communism in &gt;this country. In effect, he is accused 'Of being false not merely to his party, not merely to his oath, but to his country. Those are, I would submit, four inferences which may be drawn from a statement that the senator in question has, on every  possible occasion, preached the Communist doctrine in this chamber. </para><para>The next point I make is that words change their meaning in accordance with changes in world affairs.. Time was when it was regarded as unparliamentary to refer to any one in this chamber as a " Prussian " or a " German ". It was offensive in the context of the first world war, and honorable senators who used those expressions were obliged to withdraw them. But I venture to say that in the context of current affairs - with the Germans as the partners of the democracies in Nato - thenuse would not be regarded as at all offensive. I recall myself accusing some one of jack-booted Prussianism because of some government procedure which I did not like. No one objected to that expression, though there would have been the strongest objection to it in the context of the 1914-18 war. To-day such remarks are allowed to pass. </para><para>Let us consider now the attitude to communism in the world as it is to-day. We have had the hot war; we have had the cold war. We have a world disturbed, at the instigation of international communism, from one end to the other. Communism is, in the view of the democracies, the one great threat to peace. The expression " communism " is associated with unscrupulous methods, with spying, with infiltration, and with sabotage of the most ingenious kind that the world has ever seen. So that when, in a country such as ours, any person is accused of preaching the Communist doctrine in the context of present events- </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>102</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PEARSON, Rex</name><name role="display">Senator Pearson</name></talker><para>-  Is the Communist party an illegal organization? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>103</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCKENNA, Nicholas</name><name role="display">Senator McKENNA</name></talker><para>- As the honorable senator knows the answer, I can only assume that his question is purely rhetorical. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>103</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KENDALL, Roy</name><name role="display">Senator Kendall</name></talker><para>- Who made it a legal organization? </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>103</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HENDRICKSON, Albion</name><name role="display">Senator Hendrickson</name></talker><para>- The electors of Australia. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>103</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCKENNA, Nicholas</name><name role="display">Senator McKENNA</name></talker><para>- I am not to be diverted by such interjections, hut <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> has supplied the answer that the honorable senator seeks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> will also recall that six out of the seven High Court justices declared .the Government's attempt to outlaw the Communist party to be unconstitutional.

I took my stand with the High Court and with all those people who believed in upholding the Constitution. Since I am asked about it, I will go ahead and say that every time I feel a little bit bankrupt spiritually in this Parliament and concerning my performance in politics, I console myself with the thought that at least I played some part in preventing Australia being turned into a police state, because that was what was involved, and it was on that basis that the people of Australia rejected what this Government proposed should be done. But I did not start out to talk about that. I am afraid, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the honorable senator's interjection diverted me from the particular matter under consideration. </para><para>I refer now to one other ruling which was made back in 1918 or 1919. </para><para class="block">I  thought the interjection which gave rise to the ruling was a fairly mild one. The interjection was that a senator was associated with a party advocating repudiation of loan obligations - particularly overseas obligations. I do not have to argue, surely, to this chamber that compared with the allegation under consideration now that a man is preaching the Communist doctrine at every possible opportunity, the repudiation of obligations to repay loans was a relatively mild matter; yet that was held to be offensive and the Chair ordered that it be withdrawn. It stands as one of the presidential rulings governing considerations in this Senate. If the Chair could order that such a remark should be withdrawn as offensive, who will stand up and say that the allegation made against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is not infinitely more offensive in its nature, having regard to all the factors I have outlined? </para><para>I should like to spend a moment or two in considering the matter at this stage, apart from the particular facts, to try to pinpoint just what is the position regarding offensive statements. Standing Order 418 deals with it, of course, and states, amongst other things, that - </para><list type="lowerroman-dotted"><item label="."><para>. all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. </para></item></list><para class="block">Well now, in the context that I previously explained in this particular matter, there is the gravest of imputations against the conduct and the integrity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> and I personally could not imagine anything more offensive. If one refers to " Australian Senate Practice " for the various rulings of various presidents, it iscompletely clear that the practice - -it is called the rule in some of the books upon the subject - is for an honorable senator who makes a personal allegation against another to withdraw it when the senator against whom the allegation is directed claims that he finds it offensive. That has also hardened into a rule that the  President  always favours the person who is aggrieved. It must be for .the  President  to determine, in tact, whether a particular statement is or is not offensive, but he very properly, almost as a matter of rule, does uphold the request for withdrawal when an honorable senator claims that he finds it offensive. There are two rules to which I advert, or practices that I claim have hardened into rules. They are that a senator ought to withdraw a remark when another senator finds his statement offensive to him personally, and that the  President  always will lean strongly to the aggrieved senator in those circumstances. The broad practice that governs parliamentary institutions is set out in " May ". 1 quote from the sixteenth edition, at page 458, where, under the heading " Allegations against members ", this appears - </para><quote><para>Good temper and moderation are characteristics of Parliamentary language. Parliamentary language is never more desirable than when a member is canvassing the opinions and conduct of his opponents in debate. </para></quote><para>That is the position that governs the question of allegations in debate throughout the whole of the British Commonwealth. </para><para>Let me carry it one step further. When an honorable senator makes an allegation against another, and that other claims that it is offensive to him, I suggest the first senator is faced with three positions if he declines to withdraw. The first position is that he does not think that the honorable senator in question is really offended. That is one position, and I will come back to it after a few moments.  His  second position is that he is indifferent as to whether the senator is offended or not. That is not a good stand. And we come to the third position, which is that he means to be offensive. I put it to the Senate that that would be an exceedingly bad standard. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>104</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7A</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SPOONER, William</name><name role="display">Senator Spooner</name></talker><para>- You have missed the point also that he might be justified in being offensive. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>104</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCKENNA, Nicholas</name><name role="display">Senator McKENNA</name></talker><para>- I take leave to say to the honorable senator through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the rules of this chamber require that at all times no senator shall be personally offensive to another.

Obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> did not have the opportunity to sit down and analyze the matter coldly and logically as I have attempted to do.

Would we abide by the President's ruling or by the Acting.  Deputy  President's ruling? Would a decision depend on who is in the chair at a particular time? A decided embarrassment would arise there. How could a far lessoffensive statement made in the House of Representatives be regarded as unparliamentary and the statement made here not beso regarded? We would get to a contradictory position in the Parliament, and that would be bad for the parliamentary institution. </para><para>I suggest there is a very high standard of behaviour in this chamber.

I hope that those who seek some amusement will turn back to some of the earlier debates, and read particularly the incident of the senator who was accused of associating with a party pledged to repudiation. I am delighted to say that the Senate has improved out of sight. Our debates may not be as amusing or as raw as those of former days, but they are better. </para><para>I feel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that it would be a very happy solution to the problem if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> were to withdraw his statement. None of us on this side is happy at any time to dissent from a ruling of the Chair. That is never a pleasant matter; it is always unpleasant.

Brown, who had just returned from the Nineteenth International Conference of the Red Cross at New Delhi, had stated that 84 governments had supported the Red Cross ban on nuclear weapon attacks against civilian populations. The Prime Minister's reply, which was published in " Hansard " of 5th December, 1957, shows that no such resolution had been passed. That, of course, could be found in the Communist " Tribune ". </para><para>The Communists have a certain line of approach to summit talks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne's</inline> approach is identical. That can be ascertained from reference to " Hansard " of 12th March, 1958, at pages 133 and 134. Reference to those pages will show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> was very critical of America and the Secretary of State, but, by inference, was not ill-disposed towards Russia. I am mentioning just a few examples to show where the Communist line runs. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>108</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">O'BYRNE, Justin</name><name role="display">Senator O'Byrne</name></talker><para>- It is a case of smearing me by slander. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>108</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">O'SULLIVAN, Neil</name><name role="display">Senator O'SULLIVAN</name></talker><para>- No, it is not.

I agree with some of his argument, but unfortunately I do not agree with the background or premise from which he started. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggested that three inferences could be drawn from the words that I used. He said that the first inference to be drawn was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> was doing the work of the Communists; the second inference was that he was a Communist; and the third inference, a far more serious one, was that he was a Communist and, at the same time, ostensibly a member of the Australian Labour parry, thus living a double life. I think that that expresses <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> propositions. </para><para>There is a fourth inference, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> forgot. It is just as important, and, I think, a more readily understandable one, a simpler and more obvious one. It is that the words that I used mean exactly what they say, and that is, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> at every possible opportunity - 1 emphasize the word " opportunity " - preaches the Communist doctrine. There is only one inference to draw from that. The words mean exactly what they say, and with the very greatest respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> there is no other meaning attachable to them. If I had meant to say that I believed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> was a Communist, I would have said so. I did not say that, and I no more believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is a Communist than I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna, Senator O'sullivan,</inline> or anybody else in this chamber, is a Communist. To suggest that I inferred that is both wrong and unfair. I said exactly what I meant, and while I have a great personal respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> I still mean what I said - that on every possible opportunity the honorable senator preaches the Communist doctrine. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>then proceeded to argue the technical weakness of the Acting  Deputy  President's views, and I want to say a few words about that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggested, although he did not argue it strongly, that the  Chairman  should have upheld the motion for dissent, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> felt that the words were offensive, or believed that they were. We have had' this argument in the Senate many times. All I want to say on this aspect of it is that I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> really presses that argument strongly: The words must do more than make the honorable senator aggrieved; they have to be offensive per se, as it. is called or in themselves; otherwise you get the most impossible and outrageous situation: in this chamber that at any time any honorable senator can take exception to any expression that is used by rising, and saying that that particular expression is offensive. Why, if the proposition1 that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is arguing is correct, some honorable senator could rise now and say that the very words I am using at the moment are offensive to him and therefore I should withdraw them.

" Who could preach the Communist doctrine except some one who was a Communist, or some one who was a hypocrite ?

The party has sought to denigrate that service, because it has always been a thorn in the party's side and has done its best to prevent Communists from penetrating into important positions in the defence or policy making fields. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>113</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HENDRICKSON, Albion</name><name role="display">Senator Hendrickson</name></talker><para>- The Australian Labour party set up that service. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>113</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KH5</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GORTON, John</name><name role="display">Senator GORTON</name></talker><para>-  The Communist party has always made it an object of attack. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>113</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HENDRICKSON, Albion</name><name role="display">Senator Hendrickson</name></talker><para>- But we set it up. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>114</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KH5</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GORTON, John</name><name role="display">Senator GORTON</name></talker><para>- The Australian Labour party did set it up, and it has been the object of attack by the Communists, who wanted to denigrate it in the minds of the Australian people. They attempted to do this by comparing it with the secret police in Communist-dominated or fascistdominated countries. They attempted to persuade the Australian people that the Australian security service, as set up by the Australian Labour party - and not materially altered since - has powers of arbitrary imprisonment, of arrest, of entry without warrant such as are possessed by the secret police of the fascist and Communist countries. Honorable senators will agree that that service has been the object of Communist party attack and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> - unwittingly, I know - has furthered that Communist attempt. If you read the debates we have had on the security service - I think they occurred about two or three years ago - from which I have taken that extract, it will be seen that he does equate the Australian security service with secret police organizations of that kind. And that is one example I give of the way in which I believe he has unwittingly furthered in this place that which the Communists wish the Australian people to believe. On other occasions - indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, yesterday</inline> - he made a statement by way of interjection, which I do not believe he believes in for a moment.

I do not believe there is any person on the Opposition side of the chamber who is readier to call senators on this side warmongers if their opinions are different from those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> and to call senators on this side fascists if their opinions are different from those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> himself; and I am compelled to think that there is some force to be placed on the argument that was put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> that those who are prepared to dish it out ought to be prepared to take it. But there is this difference in this case: There is not one scintilla of evidence of any kind that those on this side called warmongers want war, or those called fascists help the fascists; but there is evidence in this case that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> though not a Communist, has over a period of time on matters of foreign affairs - not all matters - and matters concerning the security service, preached the same line as the Communist party was then preaching. That is all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> said, and that is a matter of public moment and ought to be a matter for discussion, but not invective. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>114</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3R</name.id><electorate>QUEENSLAND</electorate><party>ALP; QLP from 1957; DLP from 1968</party><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BYRNE, Condon</name><name role="display">Senator BYRNE</name></talker><para>. - As one who stands on his own in this chamber, I think it is important for a separate point of view to be expressed on the matter under consideration. It is not my purpose to go into the merits or the demerits of the allegations and counterallegations concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.</inline> The two points to which I shall confine my contributions to this debate are possibly within a narrow compass. </para></talk.start><para>Looking through the precedents - the rulings of Presidents in the past - I find that there was a much greater sensitivity and resentment, and, therefore, a much wider definition of offensive terms in previous years than there is to-day, and I think that that is a good thing. While agreeing that in the ebb and flow of debate argument might be advanced with force, and refuted with equal force, I do not know that going beyond a certain point is necessarily in the interests of this chamber. All of us  have  a duty to preserve the standard of debate and the decorum of this democratic institution. </para><para>When I look at these precedents to which I have referred, I feel that our predecessors had a greater concept of the necessity to preserve that standard than perhaps we have to-day. My stand in this debate, therefore, is actuated by the thought that that sensitivity should be revived whilst allowing for the ebb and flow of debate, allegation and counter-allegation. </para><para>The terms which have been used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> are quite specific terms, and it is on the specific nature of that expression that I take my stand. To say that a person is a Communist, of course, is to make a very definite allegation of an embracing character, but there are many ways in this community in which the same allegation can be made without using that express term. I am one who, in his own conscience, has a very great regard for the character of all other people. I have often been asked, "Do you think so-and-so is a Communist? ' To such a question I am most scrupulous in the reply I give. Terms such as " following the party line " and things like that are, in the minds of most people in Australia to-day - because this thing is such a tremendous evil and works with such subtlety - alternative terms to the allegation that a person is a Communist and can be interpreted in almost the same way. </para><para>I think, therefore, that we in this chamber should show a sensitivity to the terms in which we describe each other, particularly in regard to communism, a sensitivity perhaps greater than is enjoyed by the rest of the nation. We should be particularly scrupulous not only of the characters of one another but in our choice of terms to see that nothing derogates from the standing and the character and the status of every one of us. </para><para>When I look at the precise terms in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> made his allegation against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> I cannot help feeling that, in the concepts of any expressions which are current in Australia, that could be given an interpretation which v/ould he very little less than a direct allegation that a person was. a Communist. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> did not think that in his own mind. In his speech to-day in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> he expressly denied that the idea was in his mind, and said that he would not make such a suggestion because he does not believe it to be true. Nevertheless, his words were dangerous and could be interpreted in that way. As I say, this Senate has a particular responsibility in respect of the choice of terms we select in such a dangerous field as this, and when we are dealing with the very sacred character of other members of "the Senate behind the impregnable wall of parliamentary privilege. </para><para>The second point is the use of the word  offensive ". I do not know whether it must lie in the term being offensive per se. I think that the word " offensive " must be construed rather as whether a term is reasonably capable of an offensive meaning and, of course, if that would not apply I think the argument goes out completely, and I would expect the  President  to rule that an expression was not offensive in any specific circumstance unless it could reasonably be capable of an offensive meaning. But with anything less than that, I think it rests with the person who feels himself aggrieved to take the stand that it is offensive to him; and if we are to preserve the standard of debate in this chamber, I think that that stand having been taken, resentment having been expressed, and a request to withdraw having been made, it is very wise for the person making the statement to withdraw it. </para><para>I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> and other honorable senators face a difficult situation which has already been canvassed. It was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan.</inline> These are allegations about ideas and the conflict of ideas, and it is not easy to debate whether a person expressed an idea and somebody expressed a contrary idea or challenged the first expression. But I think that by the application of good sense and commonsense in this chamber by all honorable senators, it will be possible for a completely free and untrammelled debate to proceed without any unreasonable impediment to the discussion, while keeping within the confines and the boundaries that I have suggested. The third point I make is that in this case I feel bound by precedent, and by the ruling which has already been handed down in relation to a direct allegation that a person is a Communist. In the ordinary concept of the people to-day the terms in which the offending words were expressed lie so close to a charge that a person is a Communist that they are tantamount to such a charge. In my view the ruling in the previous case might well have been applied in this instance, and because that was a ruling of the  President  himself, as distinct from what may be described, perhaps, as a court of lesser jurisdiction, though for the time carrying the President's jurisdiction and status, it would be wise for us to regard this allegation, having regard to the terms in which it was expressed, as being tantamount to the allegation on which the  President  previously ruled. </para><para>For those reasons, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> I support the motion for dissent without canvassing in any way the merits or demerits of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> whose character and position have been cleared completely by all honorable senators on both sides of the chamber who have contributed to the discussion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>116</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0L</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PEARSON, Rex</name><name role="display">Senator PEARSON</name></talker><para>. - When I was in the chair of the Senate yesterday afternoon in the capacity of Acting  Deputy President,  I gave a ruling which is the subject of debate at the present time.

On 7th August, a debate commenced in this chamber upon a certain motion relating to the printing of a paper. That debate took the form of what is commonly known as a debate on international affairs. On that day, at least two speakers contributed to the debate, which was adjourned until Tuesday last, 19th August. When the debate was resumed a change in temperament and demeanour on the part of honorable senators was evident, and the reason for that change was very easy to discover. During the period from 7th to 19th August, when the Senate was not sitting, the United Nations had discussed the very problem that was before the chamber on the 7th August. Every honorable senator was fully aware that the United Nations would establish a proper tribunal to deal with the Middle East, and to date at least some of the 81 members of the United Nations have participated in that debate. The representative of Lebanon mentioned the problems of his country; the representative of Jordan mentioned the problems of his country; and other prominent representatives, such as General Eisenhower and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Selwyn</inline> Lloyd also discussed the subject. </para></talk.start><para>Every honorable senator who took part in the debate yesterday was fully aware that he was engaging in a futile discussion and that he may as well have been talking about a fishing club.I am sure those honorable senators felt like the people who set out to look at turbulent flood waters in the district but. on arrival at the bank of the stream find that all the waters have passed away to the sea. Honorable senators were manufacturing and introducing foreign ideas into the debate and were completely lost. Most of them were wool-gathering and did not know what they were talking about. lt was in that setting that the incident now before us occurred. Had the debate taken place in this chamber before the United Nations dealt with the matter, 1 am sure this unpleasant incident between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> would not have occurred. However, we must deal with the facts as we know them. </para><para>During <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> made the mild interjection: " The old sabre rattler!

That opportunity is not offered on a plate to any senator. In my view the action of the Acting  Deputy President  showed a deliberate weakness on the part of the Chair.

The Standing Orders applicable to this matter are Standing Orders 418 and 438. Standing Order 418 reads - </para><quote><para>No <inline font-weight="bold">Senator shall</inline> use offensive words against either House of Parliament or any Member of such House, or of any House of a State Parliament, or against any Statute, unless for the purpose of moving for its repeal, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. </para></quote><para class="block">Was a personal reflection on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent?</inline> That, I submit, is the only question that has to be answered by the Senate. The issue is not whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> called <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> a Communist. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> say at the particular time? He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is always preaching the Communist doctrine. </para><para>I turn now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.</inline> I must analyse him somewhat to see whether such a statement would be offensive to him. This is what I find. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> has had a Christian .upbringing and a careful Christian education. He is devoted to the principles of his church. Every one knows that you cannot be a pagan and a Christian at the same time; you cannot practise the principles of your religion and at the same time preach paganism. You are preaching a form of paganism if you preach the doctrine of communism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is a member of the Australian Labour party, which is a political reform party. To say that he preaches the doctrine of communism is to say, in effect, that he supports revolutionary methods for the correction of economic and social problems, that he believes in the extirpation of all religious bodies and in the persecution of teachers of religion. Has any one in this chamber, or any one in the Commonwealth, ever heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> preach such things? </para><para>Preaching the doctrines of communism is not just replying by way of interjection now and again to something said in respect of legislation that this Government has brought in on various occasions. It does not mean that a man is preaching the Communist doctrine if he shows vocally that he is opposed to legislation of the Government. This charge goes further than that. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> did not realize the seriousness of his statement when he made it. He said, in effect, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> stands for the mass murder of those opposed to him politically. If he preaches the Communist doctrine, he must preach along lines similar to that. If he is a supporter of the Communist doctrine, he must also support the separation of wives from their husbands, the removal of children from the care of their parents and the concentration of all in conscripted labour camps. Will anybody assert that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> preaches that that is the doctrine to be implemented in the Commonwealth, or anywhere else in the world? </para><para>I have pointed to the seriousness of the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent,</inline> and I turn now to what may be termed the penal machinery associated with Standing Order 418. Standing Order 438 provides - </para><quote><para>If any <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline></para><list type="loweralpha"><item label="(c)"><para>uses objectionable words, and refuses to withdraw such words . . . the  President  may report to the Senate that such <inline font-weight="bold">Senator has</inline> committed an offence. </para></item></list></quote><para class="block">I submit that at present <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> is charged before the Senate with having committed a breach of Standing Order 418, and that his reply to the charge made against him is far from satisfactory. </para><para>I now turn to some of the comments that have been made. It is rather humorous to review some of the statements that have been put forward to-day in extenuation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> stand and in order to distract attention from the incorrect ruling, as I submit, given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearson</inline> yesterday afternoon. What the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> had to say to-day was paltry piffle. I have never in my life heard such stupid replies made to such a serious question. As a matter of fact, I find myself in the position that I have nothing to say in respect of his speech; I brush it all to one side. I feel sure that not one point he made has remained in the minds of honorable senators. </para><para>I now turn to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> had to say. I totally disagree with him, just as all other honorable senators on this side disagree with him. You cannot introduce the law of the jungle into the Senate. This is a parliamentary chamber. If a man attacks you, you should nothold that in the back of your mind so that on some future occasion you can attack him. If we were to adopt that as a principle, we would never be able to conduct our affairs in this chamber. It happens frequently that a man who has spoken is attacked by a subsequent  speaker  and has no opportunity of replying until another occasion. Are we to move around Canberra, or wherever we may be, carrying a grudge in our minds, with a fixed determination that when we get an opportunity we will attack the senator who attacked us? That is  not  the Australian spirit. I leave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus'</inline> remarks at that.

It was particularly offensive to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> and he asked for a withdrawal of it. It was then that the Acting  Deputy President  fell down on his  job.

                            <para>.- The motion before the Chair, which seeks to have the papers in question printed, serves no purpose other than to enable the Senate  to  fill in time. The Government has no legislation to bring before the Senate. It does not matter whether or not the motion is agreed to, because in fact the papers have already been printed. No amendment that may be agreed to will have the slightest effect on the Government's financial proposals for the year, because at the moment there is no appropriation bill before the Senate. </para>

Since then, we have had, perhaps, eight of the most bountiful seasons that any people could have. Prices for our export commodities, in some instances, have been higher than we ever dreamed they would be. The only year in which we were unfortunate enough to strike a partial drought was last year. When the economy was handed into the custody of the present Government, economic conditions were expanding and the Budget had been balanced. </para>

                            <para>- It was balanced in 1949. There were high overseas reserves. Now, we find that the economy is contracting. There is growing unemployment, exports are declining, and there are almost permanent import controls. I suggest that one is justified in claiming that the position to-day is the most dangerous since the 1930's. </para>

                    <para>Let me turn to the promises that this Government made shortly before it came to office, including the famous, or infamous, one about putting value into theÂ£1. Of course, the Government parties also promised to get rid of all controls. I have often wondered, in recent years, whether the supporters of the Government have not been sorry that they made that promise, particularly those who are interested in the rural industries of Australia. Surely they must appreciate what that undertaking, followed by action to eliminate controls, has entailed. According to the price indexes, the value of money to-day is only half what it was in 1949. In 1949-50, the C series index figure was 1,669, whereas in March this year it was 2,907. Therefore, despite all the good seasons that we have had, the economic position to-day is worse than at any time since the bad years of the depression. </para>
                    <para>Let us see what this Budget does so far as the States are concerned. We all recognize that the States have important work to do. For instance, they control education, health, agriculture, roads, railways and housing, all most important services for the people. Instead of the Commonwealth treating the State as partners, from a financial point of view it treats them as competitors, although they are serving the same people. </para>

                            <para>- I will let the honorable senator make his speech in his own way, as I propose to make mine. Since we have already wasted considerable time this afternoon, I shall take all the time to which I am entitled. This year, the States will have available Â£14,000,000 less for works than they had in 1951-52, despite a cost rise of more than 50 per cent. On the other hand, the Commonwealth will spend Â£18,000,000 more on its works than it spent in 1951-52. The Commonwealth is the gatherer of the money, and it seems that this Government certainly has looked after itself to the detriment of the States. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>In respect of the same period, let us consider the public debt. The State public debt has increased to an alarming figure, while that of the Commonwealth has decreased. The Commonwealth debt at June, 1951, speaking in millions, was Â£1,771,000,000. In 1958, it was Â£1,589,000,000, a decrease of Â£182,000,00. On the other hand, the debt of the States in 1951 was Â£894,000,000, but it has since risen to the stupendous amount of Â£1,965,000,000, an increase of Â£1,071,000,000. Is it aÂ»y wonder that people say that the policy of this Government, in relation to the States, is wrong? lt makes one shudder to think that the Commonwealth, which has the right to gather practically the whole of the money that is used for governmental purposes, both State and Federal, has forced the States into the position that I have indicated. In the period from 1951 to 1958, the Commonwealth has been able to pay at least Â£180,000,000 off its debt, while the debt of the States has increased by Â£1,071,000,000. </para>
                    <para>In recent years, the ruling rate of interest has been charged on the amount by which the Commonwealth has supported the loan programmes of the States. This year, however, there will be a deficit of Â£110,000,000. The money that the Commonwealth Government receives from the Commonwealth Bank and from its deficit financing at 1 per cent., in turn will be lent to the States for their works programmes at between 4 per cent, and 5 per cent. On that deal alone the Commonwealth Government is making a profit of something like Â£4,000,000 at the expense of development in the States, despite the fact that we all belong to the one nation. In those circumstances, one can readily appreciate the attitude taken by the States towards the federal system of government. It is time to review the whole practice under which loan moneys are expended on State works and funds from revenue are provided for Commonwealth works, and make a fairer allocation in order to prevent the curtailment of development in the States. </para>
                    <para>Let us now examine the injustices being done by this Budget to the families of the nation. The Government still makes no attempt to bring child endowment up to a level at which it will have real purchasing power. There can be no half-way measures about child endowment. The Government either believes in it, or does not believe in it. If the Government does not believe in child endowment, it should say so, and should not seek to take advantage of the inflationary spiral to deprive the mothers of the nation of the benefit of a child endowment with real value. After all, child endowment was introduced by the Government in the first place to protect the employers against having to pay a reasonable basic wage to the workers. Just before its introduction, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Beeby told the government of the day that if some system of family income were not introduced he would be compelled to award a very large increase in the basic wage. </para>
                    <para>Further, the Budget makes no provision for increasing the maternity allowance, although I have no doubt that when the Appropriation Bill 1958-59 comes before us we shall see that Â£9,000,000 or Â£10,000,000 is provided for immigration. The majority of members of this Parliament agree that the best immigrants this country can have are our own children, yet, despite mounting costs, the Government does not indicate any intention to help the mothers in this direction. </para>
                    <para>On perusing the Budget I find no provision for improved health and medical services, despite the fact that there can be no doubt that those who are unfortunate enough to become ill and need such services find the cost crippling. Only last week I received from the secretary of the Swan Hill Hospital, in Victoria, a letter in which he said that although the Government's policy is to provide free hospitalization to age and invalid pensioners, it pays to the hospital only 12s. a bed a week whereas, according to him, the weekly cost of a bed is Â£4 4s. Id. If this Government really believes in free hospitalization for age and invalid pensioners, surely it is only reasonable that the Government should bear the full cost. It should not be content merely to espouse the policy, take unto itself the plaudits for such a policy and then place the onus for meeting the cost, first, on the States and secondly on the shoulders of charitable organizations and charitablyminded persons. </para>
                    <para>The Budget makes no provision for improving the housing position. If there is one vital need in this country it is the provision of houses for the people. Only recently, the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> was very happy to answer in the Senate a Dorothy Dix question about the housing position in Western Australia, but he did not say anything about the housing position in New South Wales or Victoria. No extra provision is made for housing the men for whom this Government, for political reasons, promised to provide houses upon their return from service in defending their country. Although the Government may point to the fact that Â£35,000,000 has been spent on war service homes, the true position is that there is still a cruel lag  ot  between eighteen months and two years  in  the granting of applications. During the period between the time of making application and the time of the granting of the loan, the unfortunate soldier-applicant  is  required to pay as much as 10 per cent, and 12 per cent, interest for temporary accommodation. </para>

                            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was giving the quarterly figures of houses commenced, completed and under construction, and the number of people engaged in the building industry, between June, 1955, and April, 1956. The official figures showed a drop in the number of persons employed, even in June, 1957, to 212,000. This was followed by a drop in April of this year to 205,000.  I  pointed out that as the proportion of nonresidential building was increasing rapidly, especially in the main cities, one could truthfully say that the home building rate was declining even more than was shown by the figures. </para>

                    <para>The Budget fails to help the family man in another way because it makes no provision tq attempt to cope with the hire-purchase problem. It may be doubtful whether the Commonwealth has jurisdiction in the matter, but when the last Budget was debated it was pointed out that if the Government were keen to do something it could sanction the entry of the Commonwealth Bank into this field. It was further pointed out, that the Government could at least have called a meeting of the State Premiers and attempted to tackle the problem of high interest rates. </para>

                    <para>What worries me more than anything else is the way in which the indebtedness of the people increases month by month. The hire purchase figures are staggering. In June, 1955,. the outstanding balance amounted to Â£182,000,000. In June, 1956, the figure was Â£202,000,000. In June, 1957, it was Â£235,000,000 and in June, 1958, it rose to Â£293,000,000. That represents a very big increase in public indebtedness. The " Institute of Public Affairs Review " suggests at page 55, volume 12, that hire purchase instalments now absorbed between 6 per cent, and 7 per cent, of all personal income remaining after tax has been deducted. The effect on the family can be seen when it is realized that household goods worth Â£67,200,000 were obtained on hire purchase in the year 1957-58. That figure does not include the expenditure on motor vehicles, which was Â£25,500,000 more than the previous year's figure. </para>
                    <para>I admit that I would not favour the abolition of hire purchase for that would create chaos in industry, but at least something should be done to regulate it. If that is not done, the public will have to accept a debt burden which will produce tremendous hardship in time to come. Future governments, irrespective of their political colour, will have to meet a social service bill of staggering dimensions. The present trend seems to be for retail firms, by clever advertising, to persuade people to owe twice as much, as they earn, content in the knowledge that they can get the credit they need. In 1920, about 56 per cent, of persons eligible in age for social services were found to have sufficient means to care for themselves, but in recent years the figure has dropped to as low as 33 per cent. The hire-purchase racket is so rampant that we will some day have to meet staggering social service burdens. </para>
                    <para>As has already been pointed out in another place, the basic wage earner with two children will, under this Budget, pay in tax 5s. 6d. a week, or 5 per cent, more than he paid in the year 1954-55. I remind honorable senators that in the immediate postwar years such persons paid no tax at all. The government's failure to check inflation has resulted in wages chasing prices. Wages have not, of course, won the race, but the average wage-earner has, in the process, been carried into a higher income bracket. The single basic wage earner now pays in income tax from 1 <inline font-style="italic">0i</inline> per cent to 1 1 per cent, of his wages. In 1954-55 he paid 9Â£ per cent. A family man on the basic wage will pay <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent, this year, as against 4i per cent, in 1954-55. And remember, this was after the Government's promise that taxation would be reduced! </para>
                    <para>Let us have a look at the injustice to age and invalid pensioners because they, in common with other recipients of social services, are entitled to expect the purchasing power of their pensions to be kept abreast of increased costs. If the age pension had been maintained at its relative 1948 value, it would now be Â£4 17s. 6d. a week. All that the Government is doing in this Budget is to give an increase of 10s. a week to certain pensioners who are paying rent. What will that mean? It will mean increases of rents. Even the Liberal Government of Victoria  ha9  already increased by 2s. 6d. a week the rent of housing commission premises occupied by age pensioners. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it was the cause of the fall. All I am saying is that we have priced ourselves out of .the overseas markets. I shall speak further about that matter before I conclude my speech. One would have thought that  in  these times some semblance of justice would be given to those who are  lea9t  able  to  fend for themselves. </para>

                    <para>Let us have :a look at the injustice that is being done to the small businessmen and the middle businessmen in the  community.  I know that Government senators are not interested in these people because they do  'not  contribute to their parties' funds. Between now and 22nd November, the only people they will be interested in are those who are prepared to dip deep into their pockets to contribute to electoral expenses. Last year, company income fell by Â£9,000,000, although monopolies like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, General Motors-Holden's Limited, hire-purchase companies and big retail organizations made record profits. In the result, the small businessmen are being driven out and replaced by big concerns. I know that Government senators are not interested in the small business people, but at least they are part and parcel of this nation and, in their small way, they have helped to build this nation. It is not  too  much to expect the Government to treat them justly. </para>
                    <para>Let us consider the injustice that is being done to the farmers. The income of farms not registered as companies was Â£359,000,000 last year, compared with Â£448,000,000 in 1949-50 and Â£756,000,00.0 in 1950-51. In fact, farm income last year was less than half what it was in 1950-51, and it was the lowest for nine years. Furthermore, money is worth only half what it was worth in 1950-51. The income of farmers last year was Â£390,000,000 compared with Â£426,000,000 in 1948-49 and Â£707,000,000 in 1950-51. This Budget makes no attempt to help the farmers. The Government is not worried that to-day the dairy farmer has to sell  a  proportion of his produce at less than half the cost of production. It is not helping him at all. What is more, the Government recently connived in an increase in the price of butter by 2d. per lb. Statistics, show that less butter is now consumed in this country than for years past. Therefore, it seems that more butter will have to be sold on the export market although, as I have pointed out, it is selling on that market at about half the cost of production. </para>
                    <para>I come now to a consideration of falling export incomes, leading to falling international reserves and necessitating, probably, drastic import cuts in the near future. A review of the prices of exports in June, 1958, shows that wool was down 33 per cent, compared with June, 1957; butter was down 42 per cent.; meat was down 13 per cent.; sugar was down 26 per cent; and metals were down 16 per cent. It is true that in the same period overseas prices for wheat increased by 14 per cent., for dried fruits by 3 per cent, and tallow 4 per cent. The overall export prices for all commodities were 24 per cent, lower than last year. </para>
                    <para>The fall in prices is reflected by a 'fall in our overseas trade balances. Between May, 1957, and May, 1958, our overseas balances fell by just over Â£200,000,000. For every month of this year, except March, we have had an unfavorable balance of imports as against exports. Here are the figures. In January, 1958, the unfavorable balance was Â£10,700,000. Up to July this year, the total deficit was Â£38,000,000. These figures do not take into account freight and insurance payable on imports which, according to the Commonwealth Statistician will amount to Â£125,000,000 for 1957-58. </para>
                    <para>Other factors that have to be considered in relation to balance of payments are gold production, overseas payments of dividends, profits, interest, royalties and overseas investments here. As we had an adverse balance of payments of Â£178,000,000 last year, at the present rate of imports and exports the adverse balance of payments this year will be between Â£250,000,000 and Â£300,000,000. Since current reserves are only about Â£500,000,000, further drastic import cuts are certain while this Government remains in office. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can talk about New Zealand if he wishes, but let us look at the position from an internal point of view. We have overproduction and under-consumption, a classic indication of bad times ahead. Our factories are reaching the stage at which they are not working at full capacity simply because the consumers do not have the money to buy the goods produced. The secretary of the textile union in Victoria has informed me that most of the factories in that State are working short time. That statement is borne out by an article in the April issue of the Department of Trade survey of industry which states - </para>

                    <para>Let us look now at the unemployment position. It is admitted that to-day approximately 70,000 people are looking for jobs but, according to the Government's official bulletins, there was a slight fall in the number of unemployed in July last due to seasonal work in Queensland. The Government has admitted that 30,000 people are receiving unemployment benefits, but of course there is a much greater measure of concealed unemployment in the form of, for example, married women who previously were employed but now are not. So the figures quoted by the Government do not give a true indication of the number of unemployed in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Over the last few years our population has increased by between 200,000 and 220,000 persons a year. In normal times the work force from that number would be between 60,000 and 70,000 a year. In the period between June, 1954 and June, 1955 the number in employment rose by 91,000, while in the period between June, 1957 and June, 1958 the number in employment increased by 21,000 over the previous year. Those figures indicate conclusively that neither the natural increase in the work force of between 60,000 and 70,000 persons, nor the usual number of young people who leave school to go to work, was absorbed into industry. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> said in another place that we cannot improve the position in Australia until things right themselves in the United States. He was speaking on that occasion about our export markets and the prices we were receiving for our exports, which have a great bearing upon the unemployment position in Australia, because if the farmer receives a reasonable price for his products, not only on the home market but on the export market also, the factories in the cities in turn reap the benefit. </para>

According to an article I read in a publication issued by the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the United States, the Government of that country does not expect to be out of trouble until 1961. If, as the Minister for Primary Industry said, we have to wait until the position in the United States is rectified before we can return to normal, we shall certainly have to wait a very long time. The article to which I referred was based on very reasoned thought, but let us hope its forecast is wrong. So far as the primary producers are concerned, the position seems to bring to mind the old saying, " Live, horse! and thou shalt have grass ". </para>

                    <para>Summing up, let me say that this Budget has been presented by a government that has been in office for too long. It inflicts injustice on the States, on the families, on wage-earners, and, particularly, on the farmers. It fails to take account of serious trends in the economy of the nation. Farming income is the lowest for nine years, and in real terms is only one-half of what it was in 1949-50. The rate of home construction is greatly below what it was seven years ago. Honorable senators opposite attempted to convince the people that more houses were not being built because there was not sufficient man-power and materials, but they got away from that excuse pretty quickly when it was proved conclusively that the only factor retarding home construction at that time was that the Government would no provide enough money. </para>

                            used some rather extravagant phrases in his speech, and I shall refer to one or two of the things he said before I forget them. He referred briefly to election funds, but he forgot to mention that some people get their election funds by compulsory levies.

                                <para>-  I will tell you about both of them, because they are great landmarks. The fact that we are prepared at this juncture to use Â£110,000,000 worth of central bank credit is one of the most interesting features of the Budget as far as honorable senators on this side are concerned. It has been said that our parties are all right in good times, but if ever we were faced with a position like this we would never use bank credit. It has been said that rather than do that we would reduce wages and kick people out of their jobs. But the Opposition is now faced with the fact that, confronted with adverse world conditions, we are prepared to use this type of finance. </para>

                                <para>-  I would not miss it for the world. I will even write it down for you, if you wish. The other thing of which I am proud is that in this Budget, the last budget which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden will present to the people, he resisted what must have been the very great temptation, in an election year, to go out with flying colours, making all sorts of promises to the people. That must have been a very great temptation. It stands to the credit of our great Treasurer that, because of the financial position of the country, he has resisted that temptation and has given us a sound, solid and stable Budget. </para>

Let us have a look at what the Government has done for the States this year in addition to their ordinary allocations. At the meeting of the Australian Loan Council on 13th February, an additional Â£5,000,000 was made available to the States for the period ended on 30th June last. That was equal to Â£15,000,000 for a full year. At the same time, local government authorities were given permission to increase their borrowings by an additionalÂ£3,000,000. </para>

                                <para>- They have some of it.I shall tell you in a minute how they will be getting the rest of it, if you will wait. At the meeting of the Loan Council in June, the six States were given an additional Â£23,000,000 to spend on works and housing. That is not just chickenfeed, you know. I beg your pardon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President;</inline> I should not have used the expression " chickenfeed ". That is not a small amount; it is a considerable sum of money. An additionalÂ£2,600,000 has been made available from the Commonwealth Aid Roads Fund, making a total of Â£35,000,000 for the year. An additional Â£4,000,000 has been made available to universities, bringing their total to Â£7,150,000. Altogether the six State governments will have received Â£510,000,000 of Commonwealth revenue and loan money to spend mainly on works and housing. Those figures represent large increases. That is some indication of what we have done for the States. In addition, I can show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> how the States will receive Â£30,000,000 this year in addition to their tax reimbursements. If that is an injustice to the States, it is the kind of injustice that I would like to have a little more of. </para>

                                <para>- He knows the answers, all right! There is no need to worry about him! In the week ended 25th April, the Government advanced from central bank funds anotherÂ£20,000,000 for credit purposes, in the week ended 23rd May an additional Â£15,000,000, in the week ended 27th June another Â£15,000,000, and a further Â£10,000,000 at the end of July. Altogether Â£75,000,000 of additional credit has been pumped into the economy since February this year. Yet the Opposition has the audacity to move an amendment to the effect that the Government is doing nothing to correct adverse trends on the Australian economy! What utter nonsense! I repeat that within those few months we have pumped into the economy an additional Â£75,000,000 of bank credit. </para>

                                <para>-  I have never known the people of Australia not to be able to use all the bank credit that can be made available to them, and to use it to good purpose. Moreover, an additional Â£80,000,000 from war loans will be paid back to the people in cash to spend as they will. The Government is also making available an additional Â£1,000,000 in the form of a copper bounty. That interests my State of Tasmania, where there is a very large copper mine. Instead of adopting the Tariff Board's recommendation for a duty on copper, the Government is making provision for a duty and a bounty, the bounty being designed particularly to offset the social problems. that arise in a mining centre when a mine is in difficulties. The bounty of Â£45 a ton is designed specifically to help mines like those at Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan. The provision of that bounty is a great step forward. The measures to which I have referred have been taken by the Government swiftly. Yet the Opposition comes here with this charge that the Government is making no contribution to correcting the trends in the economy! </para>

                            chided us for having paid back Â£180,000,000 worth of treasury bills over the last few years. I should have thought it was good, sound, prudent business to pay back borrowings when things were going well so that when a rainy day came you had something to put aside. Where would we have been if the people had listened to all the nonsense that was spoken in 1954 when the Australian Labour party tried to bribe the electors with its policy about the means test, and other promises which, if given effect, would have meant squandering every penny that we had put aside for a rainy day? Where would we have been if we had accepted all those gilded promises? It does not matter whether this Government or a Labour government is in office; it cannot stop a drought, nor can it prevent overseas prices from falling. Where would we have been if honorable senators opposite had been in office and had squandered all that money? The Australian people know you only too well. Consequently, they would not give you the opportunity to govern, in spite of those terrific promises. The people want stability, above everything else, and that is what they have had over the last few years.
                        </para>
                        <para>I was also interested to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> chided us about having run down our overseas balances. I have never thought that having Â£700,000,000 or Â£800,000,000 in banks in London was of much good to us. I like to see money transformed into capital goods that are brought out to Australia to provide employment for our people. </para>
                        <para>Where have honorable senators opposite been during the last few years? Have they been asleep? Have they not seen the development that has been taking place in Australia? I could take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> to his own City of Melbourne and show him many things that he apparently does not know about. Does he know where Dandenong is? Has he ever been there and seen the factories and the way in which development has been taking place? Has he seen the factories in South Australia and New South Wales? He should go into them and see the modern machinery in them. Where does he think that machinery came from? You do not bring it from overseas by keeping Â£700,000,000 or Â£800,000,000 in a bank in London. You get it by turning overseas earnings into capital goods. To-day, the factories of the Commonwealth are better equipped to employ our people than ever they were before. </para>
                        <para>If honorable senators opposite get out of the cities and go about the countryside, what will they see? The face of Australia has been almost completely changed in the last ten years because of the importation of modern machinery which has been responsible for great increases in the area of pasture land, the construction of dams and irrigation systems, and so on. Where do honorable senators opposite think that the capital equipment to do those things came from? It came, of course, from the money which our primary producers have provided for us overseas. They do not want to see the money kept in banks over there. Of course, we want to keep sufficient funds overseas to make sure that, with our exports, we can always pay for our imports, to the ceiling of Â£800,000,000 that has been set. </para>

It is rather interesting to find that we are now being chided for not keeping money in the banks in London far in excess of our immediate needs.

                        <para>I want to spend the last few minutes of my time in answering the awful pessimism that we have heard from the other side. Australia, in the last decade, has developed into the eighth greatest trading nation of the world. That has been achieved with a mere handful of people - fewer than 10,000,000  -  and despite the tremendous job of development that we have had to tackle. The fact that we have become the eighth greatest trading nation is no mean achievement. In fact, it is an achievement of which any young nation could be proud. </para>

You learn to live with a nuisance and eventually take no notice of it. The great achievements and developments that I have mentioned cannot be hidden. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> might like to be able to put a handkerchief  over the beautiful I.C.I, building in Melbourne and pretend, until after the election, that it is not there, but it is there, and so are many other huge buildings in that city. If he goes to Adelaide he will see other great buildings and factories. Let him go to Sydney and have a look at the tremendous development there. You cannot hide these facts from the people. Propaganda will not take them away. Every week-end you see streams of motor cars all over the place. You cannot hide those motor cars, because every one can see them. You cannot hide from the workers of Australia the fact that to-day a great percentage of workers travel to work and go home in their own motor cars. Bless them! I wish they all could do that. Why should they listen to these dismal Jeremiahs opposite who try to say that Australia has not developed in the last eight or nine years? I have never heard such arrant nonsense in all my life. </para>

                                <para>- Here he comes back on the hire-purchase story. If you people over there have any real interest in stopping unemployment you will be very careful before you damage something that is providing a tremendous amount of employment in Australia, which in turn provides the wherewithal for the goods that are purchased under hire-purchase arrangements. If you have any sincere and honest wish not to cause further unemployment, be a bit careful. I believe quite sincerely that it is time that the State governments had a look at the interest rates. I was rather interested to hear it said that we should tell the State governments what to do. I thought that the State governments were quite capable of running their own show; but I understand that the Opposition, if returned, is going to tell them what to do. I say that we have no authority to tell the State governments what to do, but in due course they will, I hope, pay attention to this matter. The evil of hire purchase lies in its abuse. </para>

                        <para>Whatever else we say about Australia, we must admit that, with a modest population of about 10,000,000 people, it has made tremendous headway in the last eight or nine years, and it will go on in that way. We have to face the fact that next year, probably, our incomes will be no greater than they have been this year. </para>

                                <para>-  I do not think that the overseas price of metals is going to rise, nor do 1 think that the price of wool will rise to any great extent. I cannot see that world conditions are going to improve in the coming year. All that we have done during the last eight or nine years, in  the  clays of prosperity, has prepared Australia for a rainy day, and it has been with great pride that I have seen us doing that. I have no fear about what the people will do at the forthcoming election. They have resisted the golden promises of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> and his party before, and they" will resist them again. I realize, that this occasion is regarded as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt's</inline> swan song. For him it is go or bust this time. There is no doubt that it is a case of Sydney or the bush with the Labour party's leader. If he does not make the grade this time, then outskil That being so, there can be no doubt that the elector will be tempted with a tremendous number of promises which, if fulfilled, would wreck the finances of this country. Fortunately, however, the Australian people are as wise to-day if not wiser than they were in 1954. They will not take any notice of the tommyrot the Labour party puts over. Just as they did on a previous occasion, they will vote again for stability. Next November, they will return a government which has proved that it can develop the country, a government which has developed Australia at a greater pace than ever before in its history. </para>

                            <para>. - The Budget under review has made no impact upon the nation. It gives nothing, and it takes nothing away. The Government claims that it is a budget of economic necessity brought about by falling markets. As a national budget, it is an abject failure. It does not take into account our national well-being, especially in the light of our present perilous position in South-East Asia. National development and increased immigration are essential to our future welfare. We have the man-power and the materials available, and now is the time for unprecedented national development. I have no desire to see this Government retire into its shell just because of a cool deflationary breeze. Controlled inflation means progress, and we want progress in this country at the present time. We must not be afraid to gamble with Australia's economic future. If we are afraid, if there is no development, we shall not be able to hold this island continent for very much longer. It is essential that we plan for eventualities, that we do more than just hold the status quo. But, in my view, this Budget does no more than seek to hold the status quo. We cannot afford to allow this young country to stand still. As I pointed out earlier, we are in too perilous a position as a SouthEast Asian country to stand still, but I am afraid that this Budget seeks to do no more than have Australia stand still. </para>

                        <para>Having made those general observations, I should like now to particularize. I take social services first, not because they are the most important consideration - we know that the maintenance of Australia as a free country is the most important of all considerations - but because I think that this is one direction in which the Government could have done something to raise the standards of our needy people. Australia . feels let down, and this failure to do anything in this direction emphasizes to me and to the people of Australia the utter futility of the Evatt Opposition in this Parliament. Honorable senators know the feelings of my party about social services. Suffice it to say that when the social services legislation comes before this Parliament the Government can expect short shrift from us. </para>
                        <para>We are in rather a quandary about the whole matter. The Government has introduced a Budget which does nothing to help the pensioners and which does nothing to help progress, and, in view of the fact that this is an election year, such a Budget puts us in a quandary. Because the Budget seeks to do nothing, my party has to weigh the position and decide which is the lesser of two evils - the economic policy of the Government or the Evatt party's foreign policy. </para>
                        <para>I should like to state here and now that it is impossible for my party to support the Evatt Labour party, especially under its present leadership and management. We have several reasons for that decision. The first is that the Evatt Labour party's policy follows pro-Communist lines. </para>

                        <para class="block">Having heard those statements, honorable senators will see why it is impossible for my party to support the Evatt party in any election while it is under that management and leadership, and while it is following those policies. We have to choose the lesser of two evils. That is why we are in a quandary in this matter. </para>
                        <para>I pass now to the social service field. The Budget offers a pittance, in the way of rent assistance, to the single pensioner. It is something, but as even the State governments propose to filch some of it, I cannot imagine what will happen when the landlords get to work. At this point,I would like to state my own party's policy - a policy which I have put forward in two successive Budget sessions, but which has never been supported by the Evatt party. Our policy is that pensions should be taken out of the realm of politics. They should not be used as electioneering propaganda year after year. An independent tribunal should be set up to ascertain the needs of the pensioner if he is to have a reasonable - not a luxurious - standard of living. That done, it is the Government's duty to find the money. Moreover, if, as a result of inflation, the cost of living rises, the necessary adjustments must be made to keep the pension effective and provide a decent way of life for the pensioner. I hope that when we move to introduce the appropriate legislation we shall at least have the support of the Evatt party. </para>
                        <para>There has been a small increase in war pensions, but no effort has been made to accede to the very reasonable requests of the partially blinded soldiers. The means test must be liberalized. In fact, it is high time that legislation providing for the complete abolition of the means test was introduced. </para>
                        <para>To-night, I wish to put forward a scheme which,I believe, would have far-reaching effects.It follows the policy that my party intends to pursue if ever it gains the treasury bench, and the chances are that that will come about. If it does, my party will introduce a national dependants assurance trust, embodying age, widows and invalid pensions, funeral allowances, and pensioners medical payments. </para>
                        <para>The method in operation to-day of providing allowances for those members of the community who are aged, widowed, or invalided and not able to provide effectively for their everyday needs - they are, in fact, dependants of the nation - has been proved and recognized as being totally inadequate to cope with the fluctuating wage and living costs structure. Probably the most iniquitous part of the pensioners' plight is due to the fact that the relatively few and insufficient increases of pension have usually followed a general election. The pensioners' need for justice in the way of increased pensions has been used by electioneering politicians as a means of securing votes from unsuspecting pensioners on the promise of pension rises. </para>
                        <para>As a prelude to outlining the plan for a national dependants assurance trust, I consider that a review of some facts and figures will be of benefit to honorable senators in understanding the benefits that are at present available to the Australian citizens. </para>
                        <para>The national income in 1956-57 was approximately Â£4,686,000,000. The Commonwealth revenue for the same year was Â£1,312,000,000 - approximately 28 per cent, of the national income. Pension payments in 1956-57 totalled Â£121,400,000, or approximately 10 per cent, of revenue. In view of the economists' opinion that income taxation of individuals has reached saturation point, it can be seen that there is little likelihood of a rise of any consequence in the present pension rates under the existing system. </para>
                        <para>A further guide lies in the following figures. There are to-day a number of businesses that recognize for the benefit of their own well-being the advantage to be gained by offering a measure of security to their employees on retirement. To this end, the businesses are operating private superannuation schemes. In all, 61.3 per cent, of private businesses are providing for 388,600 persons out of a total work force of approximately 2,750,000. The average pension paid was Â£5 9s. a week, or Â£1 9s. a week more than the Government can provide, while those on retiring' allowances averaged Â£6 10s. a week, or Â£2 10s. a week more than the Government pays. </para>
                        <para>The total assets of these private superannuation funds totalled Â£168,000,000, and in 1955-56 the income from those assets was about Â£26,500,000. Of this income, the employers contributed about 50 per cent., amounting to Â£13,750,000. The employees contributed Â£5,700,000, or 21.5 per cent. The remainder of the income, amounting to Â£7,300,000, or 28.5 per cent., came from investments. The most impressive aspect of the figures that I have cited was the return from investments in that period of twelve months of Â£7,300,000, or 28.5 per cent. </para>
                        <para>To explain the plan, I point out that figures were collected from life assurance offices superannuation schemes in existence, and the Commonwealth Statistician. A general average of these has been applied in the following. It was established that the average weekly wage in 1956-57 was Â£18 9s. In order to provide a pension of Â£10 10s. a week at 65 years, prior death, or total permanent disablement, a man at the age of 30 years would need to pay a weekly premium of Â£1 14s., or 9.2 per cent, of the weekly wage. The prinicpal. or sum assured, Â£3,094, plus bonuses or interest at the present rate of 2.2 per cent., will provide a capital amount of Â£5,457. It is proposed that the weekly premium of Â£1 14s. required - or better still, 9.2 per cent, of the weekly wage - should be provided by three groups, namely, the employer from profits, the Federal Government from revenue, and the employee from savings. In that order, the share of responsibility would be: Employer, 5 per cent., the Federal Government, <inline font-style="italic">3i</inline> per cent., and the employee, .7 per cent, of the weekly wage. </para>
                        <para>These percentages were based on the average amounts that employers are contributing to the various private superannuation schemes, the Federal Government's contribution average of pensions to wages, and the employees' contribution to private superannuation schemes, taking into consideration ability to pay. This is measured by the fact that employees under private superannuation schemes are, in the main, in the higher wage groups, while in the national scheme consideration must be given to the earnings of men on the lowest part of the wage structure. At the same time, every person should be encouraged to increase his own contribution if he is able to do so. </para>
                        <para>It is suggested that the method of operation of this national dependants assurance trust should be through the medium of the mutual life assurance offices, as these organizations are non-profit-making and they are set up to put the scheme into immediate operation. This would also allow those businesses which have private schemes to come in with the Federal Government and employees in their contribution without costly transfer of their schemes to another body. </para>
                        <para>The interesting point about this scheme is this: Housing and the subsequent finding of rent represent probably the greatest problem of pensioners, both present and future, under the present system coupled with the existing and the foreshadowed further housing lag, caused entirely by lack of adequate finance being available to the average wage-earner. It is seen that the finance will be available to cope with this problem through the national dependants assurance trust. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland, at the the National Housing Convention convened by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, pointed out that Australia was still short of 100,000 houses and he suggested that a building rate of 75,000 houses a year, increasing to 82,000 in three or four years, would overcome the problem within five years if based on the anticipated marriage and birth rate, and a net capital cost of Â£3,000 for each house, or an overall cost of Â£22,500,000. </para>
                        <para>It will be seen, therefore, that the financing of housing is well within the scope of the national dependants assurance trust inasmuch as the income of the trust, based on an average contribution of Â£1 14s. a week, or Â£88 8s. a year per person, for a work-force of 2,750,000, would amount to approximately Â£243,000,000. The sum of Â£22,500,000, as envisaged by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Copland, would not present any problem. On the contrary, it is felt that his estimate of Â£3,000 a house is more than a little conservative. There is no reason why the full amount of Â£4,557 required to build a house should not be provided through the national dependants assurance trust. </para>
                        <para>The borrower would be required to repay the loan by amounts equivalent to the contributions paid, plus an interest charge to maintain the 2.2 per cent, rate required to sustain the ultimate pension. By means of this scheme loans at a low rate of interest would be available for housing. The present Government could well implement the scheme, which would not only eliminate the pensions means test, but would also help greatly in relieving the housing shortage in Australia. </para>
                        <para>Having dealt with the ills of the social service legislation, and having provided what we think is a cure, I now stress the position of the family man. The whole of our economic thinking is based on the family, and that is why we say that socialization will not cure the ills of our economic system. The State should be subservient to the family, not the family subservient to the State. </para>
                        <para>With our present wage policy the single man receives the same wage as the family man who does the same job. I cannot see any way in which that system can be altered to provide for a man being paid according to his responsibilities. The only solution is to increase child endowment and provide marriage loans. The plan of the Australian Democratic Labour party is to increase the child endowment for the second, third and fourth children from 10s. to Â£1; for the fifth child to 22s. 6d.; for the sixth child to 25s.; for the seventh child to 27s. 6d.; and so on, until the maximum of 40s. is reached. Thus, a family with six children would receive Â£5 12s. 6d. child endowment instead of Â£2 15s. as at present. </para>

                        <para>Full employment is an integral part of our economy. We know that unemployment is wasteful, particularly in a young country like Australia. The only way to stop this long-term unemployment is to step up our national development to take up the slack that cannot be taken up by private enterprise. Automation has already been introduced into Australia, particularly in the boot factories in Melbourne, and steps must be taken to overcome the displacement of labour that has followed. To halt the rise of unemployment, it is essential that co-operation exist between the Federal Government and the State governments. The Australian Democratic Labour party suggests that the Government should train, or re-train, displaced factory workers who may have been employed on a certain job for 10, 20, 25 or 30 years, and equip them to take their place on some other job. </para>
                        <para>Legislation must be introduced to ensure that the purchasing power of our incomes increases proportionately to the increase in production. Automation has been introduced into Australia and its use will be widened as time progresses. We want to initiate moves to ensure joint consultation between employers and employees, with the object of planning the introduction of automation. Where unemployment arises as a result of the introduction of automation, displaced workers should be compensated at least to the extent of the basic wage. Automation will mean greater production and greater profits, but we cannot sit idly by and allow people to become unemployed and eventually live in squalor and then die, as happened during the industrial revolution of the last century. If automation is coming we must be prepared for it and ensure that the profits obtained from it do not go to only a few. We must also ensure that it causes no hardship to workers. </para>
                        <para>Before leaving the economic aspects of the Budget, let me say that the family man must be protected against the hire-purchase racket that is absorbing our national income.  I  was asked a moment ago how the benefits  I  have been suggesting could be financed. At present our public works have to be financed from revenue because money that should be going into loans is pouring into the hire-purchase companies, due to the attrac tion of the high interest rates that can be obtained. The result is that loans are not being filled, so the Government has to finance from revenue national works that will be used by the people of the future. Seeing that these public works will advantage people in the future, those people should carry their share of the financial responsibility. National projects are generally revenue earning and thus will enable the people of the future to meet their commitments. The hire-purchase racket is absorbing money that should be going into national development. I understand that last year only about Â£19,000,000 went into government loans, and that the rest of the loan money required by the States was supplied by this Government from revenue. I believe that if the diversion to hire purchase companies of money that normally would go into government loans could be diminished, the social service benefits I have suggested could be financed from revenue now given to the States to make up their loan money deficits. I also suggest that additional money could be made available by curtailing governmental administrative expenditure. </para>
                        <para>I now wish to deal with the very important matter of defence. This Budget provides the usual Â£190,000,000 for defence. That is not a large defence bill. My party is in agreement with such a vote, provided that the money is expended wisely. On a percentage basis, we are not spending nearly as much on defence as is spent by other countries, especially America and Great Britain. If there is one thing we need in Australia, it is adequate defence. Without it, we could find ourselves left out on the proverbial limb in the Pacific. </para>
                        <para>We must be prepared to meet local contingencies. Australia, of course, will not be involved in an aggressive war, but at any time in the not far distant future we could find ourselves involved in a defensive war. That defensive war would be fought with conventional weapons, so it is essential that our training should be along conventional lines and that the weapons we buy or make for our Air Force, Navy and Army should be the conventional weapon. We do not want to waste time on developing nuclear weapons. If a nuclear war comes, it will be just too bad for the world. We must, however, be prepared for the outbreak at any time of a conventional war in the South-East Pacific. </para>
                        <para>Our expenditure must be devoted to those things that are necessary. I understand that the 25-pounder gun is becoming obsolete, and that there is talk of introducing the American 105 mm. howitzer. The trouble is that the 105 mm. howitzer is becoming obsolete in America. I believe that the Australian Government should consider the use of the 4.2-inch mortar, which has a range and a fire-power equivalent to those of any of these other weapons, and at the same time has greater mobility. It has no need for motor transport. Those are matters that should be considered when equipping our forces. </para>
                        <para>As far as our Air Force is concerned, I believe that we should have some of the best fighters that America and Great Britain can produce. At present we rely on the Sabre jet, but we should be considering the kind of opposition we would encounter in a more or less localized war. We have Sabre jets, but nations to our north may have some of the faster Russian planes. Even though I think that the quality of our pilots would enable them to overcome that disadvantage, they should not be in a position where they had to do so. They should be able to meet an enemy on equal terms as far as machines are concerned. </para>
                        <para>We completely approve of regional pacts and agreements such as Anzus and Seato. We realize that they are essential to the wellbeing and security of Australia, and we are wholeheartedly in agreement with them. We believe that there should be a great determination to make the maximum possible contribution to our own and to regional defence. We support the system of national service training, which has been cut down considerably by this Government. We believe that national service training is something worth while as a means of preparing the youth of this country for any eventualities. We think it essential that the system be re-introduced and that it embrace the Navy, Air Force and Army. Under conditions of modern warfare, it is essential that there should be complete co-ordination between the three services and that every effort should be made to eliminate rivalry. A Ministry should be established to supervise and co-ordinate the development of all aspects of Australian defence and to eliminate the needless waste of public moneys. </para>
                        <para>I should now like to say a little about Dutch New Guinea. 1 understand that last night in another place the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wight)</inline> delivered a very fine speech on this subject. I advise all honorable senators to read what he had to say. He, too, realised that we were up against a very grave danger in South-East Asia. In spite of that, people say we must ship everything we can to red China and must recognize the Government of that country. If we adopt that policy, we will be cutting our own throats. We read in the press the other day that the Lysaght organization, a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, was sending steel to red China. But I have not heard any expressions of disgust from the Government about that. </para>

I understand that that steel consists of galvanized and flat steel. What will happen to it? It will be manufactured into finished articles which will be distributed in the South-East Asian countries at a price that will undercut Japanese goods. As honorable senators know, the Japanese have a very large trade in that area. But the future trade will not be competitive. The Peking Government will send its representatives to that area, as it has to Australia, and they will ask the South-East Asian countries, " What are you paying for these various articles you are receiving? " They will be told the price, and they will then say, " We will give them to you for 25 per cent, less." In other words, there will be a cold trade war. Red China will not care if it loses money on the proposition; but the Japanese will be forced out of those markets. </para>

                        <para>How will that affect Australia? That will be discovered at the next wool buying season. The Japanese will not have the necessary finance to enter competitively into our wool market. If that happens, all because of a measly Â£1,500,000 worth of steel, what will we do? We will lose millions of pounds on our sales of wool. Once the Japanese are forced out of Australia's wool market, we will be in for great trouble and the level of unemployment will rise. We must remember that Australia still depends upon the product of the sheep's back for her livelihood. </para>
                        <para>I  have not noticed any reference in the Treasurer's Budget speech to recognition being given to Formosa, otherwise known as Taiwan. It is time that the Government realised its responsibility to Australia to establish a diplomatic post or even a trading post in Taipeh. The Formosans are our friends; yet we are afraid to recognize them. I believe that the Government is doing a great disservice to this country by its continual refusal to recognize the Formosan Government. Formosa is part of the bulwark that is protecting, and will continue to protect, Australia against attack. Moreover, Formosa is America's outer line of defence. If that line is breached, America can pull back to her inner line of defence and we will no longer be necessary to America from the defence viewpoint. Once again, we will become the lonely island in the Pacific. </para>
                        <para>Australia's population, numerically, is very small. Time and time again I have emphasised that it is absolutely essential for Australia to be populated, even if there is to be a cool blast of unemployment. If we want to hold this country, we must populate it. Therefore, we must make sure that the rate of immigration is increased and not reduced. If the Evatt Labour party's policy on immigration were to be adopted, the intake would be cut to the bone with the result that, when the time was ripe all that would have to be done would be to hand over Australia to any Communist invader. We would not have the will, the power or the numbers to fight against our attacker. We must carry on with our migration scheme, and I am pleased to note that the Government is doing so. Indeed, I should like to see the Government step up the migrant intake. </para>
                        <para> Let me outline the immigration policy of the Australian Democratic Labour party. We declare that the maximum encouragement should be given to the migration of family groups; that special encouragement should be given to those people who are best fitted to assist in national development, with particular emphasis upon meeting the needs of rural industry; that the progress of European migration should be continued without regard to criticsm based on racial and political antagonisms; that the present effort to obtain a more reasonable balance between the sexes should be intensified; that particular efforts should be made to obtain migrants with special and technical skills; that the Government should campaign vigorously to obtain all the necessary sponsorships for migrants; that the moral, physical and mental standards of migrants should be ensured by efficient medical examinations and screenings, the authorities to have power to exercise discretion in special cases of hardship; that migration, on a community basis, of complete industrial undertakings should be encouraged: that chain migration of relatives of migrants already settled in Australia should be assisted actively as being the most effective means of happy and permanent integration into the Australian community. </para>
                        <para>Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I should like to deal with the question of housing. We have an abundance of materials, and we have the necessary labour. Those things have been available for quite a long time, but we have not sufficient finance to go with them. I think that it is time the Government did something about this matter. In the short time at my disposal, I want to bring before the Senate the housing policy of my party, a policy which I hope that the Government, when it is re-elected at the forthcoming general election, will introduce. We want to foster a housing programme that will enable every family to own the home that it wants, at an economic cost not exceeding the average weekly rental. We propose that the Commonwealth Government should through the appropriate agency, such as the permanent co-operative building societies- </para>

This is, of course, hardly the occasion to take that policy apart for examination. After all, we are engaged in a Budget debate and we have limited time. but briefly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole,</inline> in giving us the policy of his party, gave us a panacea and promises which probably would cost the economy hundreds of millions of pounds. In answer to an interjection as to how all the things that he promised were to be financed, we were told, " You will get that later." We had from the honorable senator the proposition that all the suggestions that he put forward were to be financed by drawing off money now spent on hire purchase. I want to remind the honorable senator, and also the Senate, that whatever else may be said about hire purchase, it cannot be said that it does not in fact provide the opportunity for the humble man, the low income man and, indeed, the middle class man, to buy consumer goods. </para>

                                <para>- At a price. If you draw off the finance that is provided for hire purchase through a free economy you threaten the livelihood and the very existence of the hundreds of thousands of people who are engaged in the manufacture and sale of consumer goods. We have heard talk in this chamber, and also in another place, regarding the interest rates charged by hire purchase organizations. I remind the Senate that in New South Wales, a Labour government has already introduced legislation to fix interest rates for hire-purchase transactions. It is a rather extraordinary thing that the ceiling rates that it has fixed are higher than the rates that are being charged by all the bona fide hire-purchase companies in Sydney. So that we should be very careful when we start to dabble in this problem of hire purchase. It is something that needs to be looked at very carefully indeed. </para>

                            who led for the Australian Labour party, made some extraordinary statements. Quite frankly, I found it difficult to follow him and to accept what he said. Often, he seemed to be arguing against himself. I have time only to make two references to his remarks. Since he led for the Opposition, I think that he rates that degree of attention. The honorable senator went to great pains to try to establish that he was quoting from official documents. Almost the very first thing he did was to quote figures regarding unemployment. He said that he was quoting from official information and official documents. The Senate may remember that he said that the registered number of unemployed was more than 70,000.  Totest  the accuracy of his statement, I  have  obtained and have in my hand a release from the Department of Labour andi National Service dated 18th August  last.  This document states, in part -

                        <para class="block">This Budget is not designed to appeal to the mercenary instincts of the community. Quite clearly, it is not a vote-catching attempt by the Government, despite what the Opposition has said. The date of the next general election has been declared; nevertheless, the Government has not seen fit to bring down a Budget deliberately designed to catch votes. Instead, the Budget has been based on a proper appreciation of the state of the nation and of its economic position. It has been designed to maintain and hold the degree of prosperity and stability that Australia enjoys and which is the envy of every other country in the free world. We have heard all sorts of subjects discussed. We have even had a speech on foreign affairs, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole,</inline> despite the fact that we had a debate on that subject and are now discussing the Budget. In view of that fact, I feel that there is need now for a re-statement of some of the basic principles and facts connected with the Budget. </para>
                        <para>During the financial year just concluded, the value of our exports fell by Â£164,000,000. This drop was caused partly by the drought experienced in a number of the States, but mainly by the heavy drop in the prices overseas for such products as wool, wheat, meat, butter and the base metals. It is true to say that as a result of these things, and other influences, the income of the Australian farming community dropped by no less than Â£180,000,000. This has obviously meant that the taxes paid last financial year were lower than in the previous year. It also means that during the current financial year the people will pay approximately Â£40,000,000 less in ordinary taxation. </para>
                        <para>Here, it is appropriate to point out that the previous Budget gave concessions of the order of Â£50,000,000, and it is only during this financial year that the full effect of those concessions will be reflected in the amount of taxes paid by the people as well as in the amount of taxes paid by companies and other organizations. </para>
                        <para>Despite this fall in Commonwealth revenue, the Commonwealth expenditure for the year 1958-59 is expected to rise by approximately Â£71,000,000. The reasons for this are not hard to find, but, in view of the attack that has been made upon the Government's proposed expenditure, I think those reasons should be re-stated. </para>
                        <para>First of all, we should realize that expenditure on both war and civil pensions, indeed the expenditure on all payments from the National Welfare Fund are estimated to increase by no less than Â£28,000,000 during this financial year. This increase is the result of the concessions this Government gave in the last Budget as well as the increase in the number of persons eligible to receive benefits through the fund. Surely no one suggests that there should be a reduction in this amount? If the Opposition believes that there should be such a reduction, then honorable senators opposite have the opportunity to say so here and now. </para>
                        <para>Payments from consolidated revenue to the State governments are to increase by Â£16,900,000 this financial year. This is due partly to the amount which they are paid by way of tax reimbursements under the Commonwealth-State agreement and partly to the payment of an additional Â£15,000,000 to some States in which severe drought conditions prevailed.I do not think anybody would suggest that we could reduce that amount. If the Opposition believes that it should be reduced, now is the time to advocate such a reduction. </para>
                        <para>The question of the redemption of loans also invites consideration. During the year, war loans amounting to something like Â£337,000,000 in Australia and another Â£26,000,000 from overseas will fall due. There might be a short call of something like Â£80,000,000 for renewal and conversion of those loans. Provision has to be made for that. Our national solvency depends upon our making provision for it. If we did not make that provision, Australia would become a bankrupt country. For that reason, nobody can challenge that provision. </para>
                        <para>The approved programme of borrowing for State works and housing is Â£10,000,000 greater than that of last year, and I do not think the increased provision can be challenged. The Government proposes to budget for a deficit of Â£110,000,000 on this occasion. To have done otherwise would have necessitated either increased taxation or substantially reduced expenditure. I suggest that either course would have caused unemployment and lack of confidence in a period of deflation, and could have laid the foundations for a period of recession. </para>
                        <para>We should all have regard for what is happening in other parts of the world, and we should all realize that as our economy is based on the vast primary industries, we are dependent upon what happens overseas. It has been suggested that a sneeze in Wallstreet has a serious effect upon Australia's economy. On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly's</inline> figures, about 12,000,000 people are unemployed in the United States at present, and Canada's unemployed total something like 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, of the work force. Great Britain herself is passing through a very difficult economic period. New Zealand is also confronted with all these difficulties. If I have the time, I want to make special reference to New Zealand, a country which is on the brink of disaster. </para>
                        <para>The situations in other countries have a bearing upon our economy but, despite that bearing, Australia can boast a standard of living, a standard of enjoyment for the people, a state of prosperity and opportunities for work which are the envy of every other country in the free world. </para>
                        <para>Reference has already been made to unemployment. I have pointed out that, as shown by figures quoted by the Minister for Customs and Excise, the position in Australia is becoming stabilized and, indeed, is improving. We all hope that it will continue to do so. </para>
                        <para>Our housing policy has been mentioned. The rate of building construction in Australia is recovering, as is proved by the fact that the number of houses completed for the year ended 30th June, 1958, was 74.333, an increase of 8.6 per cent, over the figures for the previous year. These things are pointers to the present Government's success during a period in which every other part of the world has experienced great difficulties. </para>
                        <para>Within the framework of the economic position, the Government, in its Budget, has met some very special situations. I shall state them briefly. The totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners are to receive an increase of 10s. a week There is to be a supplementary pension payment of 10s. a week to certain age and invalid pensioners who are in difficulties about the payment of rent. Every encouragement is being given to investment capital employed in prospecting for oil. We all realize that the one thing we need to set us right on top of the world is to discover oil in this country. At present, we have to find something like Â£100,000,000 each year for the purchase of crude oil overseas, and this Budget makes special provision for the encouragement of the discovery of oil in the same way as the Government made special provision for the establishment of oil refineries which have resulted in reducing by something like 50 per cent, the amount we have to pay for oil imports. </para>
                        <para>We have also co-ordinated the health scheme. Honorable senators will know that the present health scheme combines voluntary self-help and government assistance and also provides hospital, medical, pharmaceutical and tuberculosis benefits. The Budget proposes to ensure that these benefits will be made available in cases of pre-existing and chronic illnesses. Every one must agree that this is a very desirable and excellent step in our progress. </para>
                        <para>I want to refer to the position in New Zealand because, as I have said, that country is at present confronted with economic disaster. Also, it provides some very real comparisons with the position here in that, very recently, when an election was held, the New Zealand Labour party went to the people with an extravaganza of promises not unlike those that were offered to the people of Australia in 1954 by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> - and no doubt similar to those which will be offered again in the battle which is about to be joined. </para>
                        <para>Another reason why we should make a comparison with New Zealand is that it is a primary producing country. In the shadow of falling prices in primary industry, in the shadow of difficulties with overseas balances, and in the shadow of a crisis in all the other countries of the free world, the New Zealand Labour party went electioneering with extravagant promises. I have before me some details of the promises that it made, and of the result of those promises. </para>
                        <para>The first thing that the Labour party in New Zealand promised - the piece de resistance - later became known as " Walter's hundred quid." The man who is now Prime Minister of New Zealand promised that the first Â£100 of income tax need not be paid. Honorable senators may be interested to hear the details of the Labour party's advertisement on the subject. It read - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Return a Labour Government on November 30th and most of you can tear up your income tax demand and use the money you have set aside for income tax payments as a Christmas benefit for the family. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That was the type of political advertisement it used to win votes. In addition to that extravagant promise the party said that it did not believe in overseas borrowing, in import controls or restrictions of any kind. It promised to increase pensions and abolish the means test; increase child allowances; give equal pay to the sexes; give 3 per cent, housing loans; allow a huge depreciation on machinery, and offer extensive health benefits. It promised also to increase scholarships and so on, ad infinitum. It won the election by a very narrow margin. </para>
                        <para>It is interesting to note that retribution was not long in coming. Within a month the new government was forced to sell some of its securities in England to meet debts for essential imports. The Labour party had said that it did not believe in borrowing and would not even join the International Monetary Fund, but within two or three months it borrowed something like Â£20,000,000 in England. Within six months we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister of New Zealand coming to this country and in all humility asking the Australian Government - the Australian people - to provide money to help New Zealand in its hour of trouble. It is to the credit of this Government that it did provide Â£10,000,000 by way of credit to help overcome the trouble that had been produced as a direct result of stupid, brazen promises which could not be kept. </para>
                        <para>The real day of reckoning came on 26th June, which was later to be described as "Black Thursday". The Budget provided for increases in income tax of up to 20 per cent. Personal exemption concessions were removed, and dividend taxation was increased by 7 per cent, in the Â£1, although company profits were already taxed to the extent of 10s. in the Â£1 at the source. Estate duty was heavily increased; government duty and stamp duties were raised substantially; sales tax on motor cars was doubled - up to 40 per cent.; and petrol tax was increased by ls. a gallon to 2s. 3d. a gallon. Cigarette duty was doubled, as also was tobacco duty. The duty on spirits was doubled, from Â£3 to Â£6 a gallon. In all, the rise in tax per head of population in the short space of six months was from Â£108 18s. lid. to Â£125 6s. 5d. </para>

                                <para>- As the honorable senator has reminded me, the New Zealand Budget hit practically every section of the community, but placed the heaviest burden on the traditional targets of the socialists - the investors, the companies, the smokers, the motorists - in short, the humble man. That is the story of a Labour party which was prepared to promise the sun, the moon and the stars, but in the end had to send people home in the dark. </para>

                        <para>I have gone to some trouble to describe what happened in New Zealand because the policies applied there followed the pattern of those enunciated by the Australian Labour party in 1954. I know that the people of Australia will look at the New Zealand scene and realize just what would happen here if they were so innocent as to fall for such nonsense. I realize that honorable senators opposite, who are trying to interject, will be glad when 1 have sat down, because I have been hitting them hard. </para>
                        <para>In conclusion, let me say that Australia is a young and vast country with a small population, but in the short space of nine years - the lifetime of the present Government - it has taken tremendous strides. The Government has put its faith in a vigorous immigration programme. It has encouraged private enterprise to expand and get on with the job. We should never forget that private enterprise provides employment for three out of every four persons who work. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> has said, one can see on all sides evidence of great progress and great confidence in Australia's future. We must be at pains to maintain that confidence, because fear grows on fear. This Budget is designed to foster confidence. It is a declaration by the Government parties of their faith in Australia's future. If we continue along those lines and adhere to the principles which we have enunciated and carried out during the last nine years, Australia will go on from strength to strength and will justify the title " Australia Unlimited ". Indeed, Australia's future cannot be measured at this stage. We have all the ingredients for success and only need goodwill and faith in ourselves. !f we have those qualifications there is a place in the sun for all who come after us. </para>

                            <para>. - Before I proceed to deal with the Budget, may I say on behalf of the Australian Labour party that we accept the apology for that document that was offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson?</inline> I shall endeavour to correct a couple of misstatements by the honorable senator in his references to New Zealand. He omitted to mention that the Labour Government in New Zealand succeeded the Holland Liberal Government which had been in office for eight years. That Government did exactly what the Australian Government is attempting to do in the Budget. Any one who cares to look through the records will find that the Holland Government in New Zealand did exactly what a Liberal government did in this country during the 'twenties. It went out of office in 1929 after introducing a Budget similar in tone to the Budget that has been brought down in Australia this year. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I have never heard a greater condemnation of a Liberal government than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> voiced, because the Holland Government left utter chaos in New Zealand when it went out of office. The honorable senator outlined at length what the incoming Labour government had to do in order to save the country from bankruptcy as a result of eight years under a Liberal government. I think I have said sufficient on this issue to let the listening public know the truth behind the misleading propaganda to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> resorted. </para>
                        <para>Let me correct the honorable senator in relation to another matter. He said that this Government had given an assurance that it would improve conditions under the national health scheme in relation to chronic cases. I emphasize that the Government said that it endorsed certain principles, but it gave no assurance at all. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The Government has endorsed the principle of Commonwealth assistance to special insurance funds established by registered health insurance organizations for persons who cannot be insured at normal rates because of age, pre-existing or chronic illness. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">There is a vast difference between endorsing a principle and taking action to give relief to chronic cases. There is no information in the Budget to show that the Government will do anything under the iniquitous national health scheme to assist chronic cases. It is evident, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> engaged in propaganda. After getting off his misleading propaganda, he jumped up and ran out of the chamber, as he usually does when a stunt is over. </para>
                        <para>Let us consider the contents of the Budget. It does not provide any check on the amount of credit that can be channelled into hire-purchase finance, or in relation to interest charges. As we know, there has been a release of credit this year. Government senators have referred to the release of Â£75,000,000 worth of bank credit to the general public, but there has been no stipulation that this money shall be applied to increase production and not channelled into the hire-purchase field. </para>
                        <para>We find that the Government lacks confidence to approach the general public for all the loan money it needs. Instead of going to the loan market, it proposes to utilize treasury-bill finance to the extent of Â£110,000,000, which amounts to a further release of credit. There is plenty of money available in Australia. Make no mistake about that! But no action has been taken to direct it into correct channel's. Through the associated banks, the greater proportion of the available money finds its way into the hire-purchase field. We say that the hire-purchase system is a good thing, provided it is properly controlled; but at the present time hire-purchase money cao be used over and over again within a period of twelve months, resulting- in interest rates of from 70 per cent, to 80 per cent, being obtained on the payment of the first instalment. I say that this is legalized robbery. This Budget has been designed to assist the big financiers who are engaged in hire-purchase activities and things of that nature - not the general public at all. As I have said, no measures are proposed to direct the credit that has been released into productive fields. It is left to the wild imagination of the banks to decide how the money may be used. </para>
                        <para>The Government does not propose to introduce any measure to check the falling-off in home building. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> said that home building was increasing, but a study of the relevant statistics will show that the rate of home building has been steadily declining for years, and that it is still declining. It is of no avail for government senators to shake their heads, because they cannot get away from the figures that have been published by the Commonwealth Statistician in relation to the number of building workers who are unemployed. There has been no check to the ever-increasing pool of unemployed. Responsible Ministers recently admitted that there is an increase in the pool of unemployed persons. </para>
                        <para>No measures are proposed to meet adequately the needs of the State developmental programmes. The States have been humbled and the stage has been reached at which year after year the Premiers ask the Commonwealth, " Please, may we develop this project or that project." Repeatedly, the Commonwealth has dictated to the States as to what projects shall be completed and those that shall not be completed. In other words, the States are being deprived of their local autonomy. They are not being permitted to govern their own affairs. </para>
                        <para>We are considering a record Budget, which discloses that Â£337,000,000 is required to meet maturing loans in Australia this year, and another Â£26,000,000 in London. An amount of Â£210,000,000 is required for State works and housing, and another Â£7,000,000 for war service land settlement. A total amount of Â£1,575,000,000 is needed, of which Â£1,302,000 will be provided from Consolidated Revenue. But the Government is not game to approach the loan market for any more than Â£115,000,000. This in a time of great prosperity. Government spokesmen have said that the country was never more prosperous, yet the Government is not game to try to raise, on the open market, the money that is needed. The so-called notorious Labour government in 1943, when about 40 per cent, of the population were engaged in war and in war production, asked the people to subscribe Â£215,000,000 in loans, and they did so. Despite the fact that this Government stated in earlier years that the issue of bank credit would cause wholesale inflation, it now proposes to resort to treasury-bill finance to the tune of Â£110,000,000. Instead of raising the money on the loan market at a restricted rate of interest, the Government is to channel another Â£110,000,000 of bank credit to the general public. That amount could be obtained readily from the peopleif they had confidence in this Government. The Government is resorting to a method of finance that it has condemned for many years. </para>

I made a note of the things mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty.</inline> He said he was very proud of the issue of Â£110,000,000 of national credit, but. he did not say he was proud of the stand taken by his party in relation to the Â£18,000,000 worth of fiduciary notes that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> wanted to issue some years ago in order to save hundreds of thousands of people from starvation by giving them a meagre allowance. Not at all. The then Opposition said that the proposed fiduciary issue of Â£18,000,000 would bankrupt the country. To-day the Liberal-Australian Country party Government says that a treasury-bill issue of Â£110,000,000 will not have an adverse effect. upon our economy. Isay it will have an even greater adverse effect than would have flowed from the implementation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore's</inline> proposal. </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>This Government has failed to do what it  has often chided the Labour party for not doing, that is, first, to control the extortionate rates of interest being charged to-day by hire-purchase companies which are crippling Australia's economy, and, secondly, to see that the credit issue of Â£110,000,000 is channelled into reproductive works. Nobody can deny that the States have not been treated in such a way as to permit them to carry out their programme of developmental works, yet they are expected to absorb the increasing number of immigrants coming to this country. The works programmes of the States have had to be reduced to the 1950-51 level. If that is not designed to tripple the States, I should like to know what is. </para>
                        <para>The Budget before us brings to my mind the Budget presented in 1929 by the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, who stated that unemployment was of no account provided the economy could be maintained at a stable level. In 1929, when the country had a pool of unemployed, the public works programme was reduced to one-third of the previous year's programme. The Bruce-Page Government admitted that its revenue from direct and indirect taxes would be reduced, just as this Government is admitting to-day. Just as in 1929 the people did not trust the Bruce Page Government sufficiently to lend it money, so the people to-day do not trust the Menzies-Fadden Administration which has now resorted to the issue of bank credit. No one could complain at that course of action provided that action were taken to ensure that the credit issued would be used on reproductive works or to control interest rates charged by hire-purchase companies. But it is not to be so used. The money will be thrown willy-nilly to the general public, and those who have much will get more, while the masses which have little will get less. That is inevitable under the Government's scheme. Not only State public works but also Commonwealth public works have been pruned. </para>
                        <para>Government supporters say that the fiscal position will correct itself, and they quote the economic situation in other countries in an effort to dodge the issues raised by this Budget. One honorable senator opposite said that America spends 36,000,000,000 dollars on defence, which represents Â£100 in Australian currency per head of the American population. Does he suggest that we should spend Â£100 per head of population on defence? If he does, on the basis of 10,000,000 people, the amount would be Â£1,000,000,000, or practically the whole of the revenue the Government is budgeting for this year. That is an illustration of the stupidity of honorable senators opposite. </para>
                        <para>The honorable senator said that unemployment in Australia represented only about 1 per cent, of the population, while in America it was 7i per cent., and in Canada 9 per cent. Does he suggest that our percentage of unemployed should reach the American and Canadian figures before the Government begins to sit up and take notice of the position? It is all right for honorable senators opposite sitting in smug security to make such statements; if they were among the 67,000 unemployed they would tell a different story. </para>
                        <para>Honorable senators opposite have said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> had analysed the income of the primary producers on an incorrect basis. The Government itself has admitted that the income of primary producers last year was Â£180,000,000 less than it was for the previous year. That reduction in income will have severe repercussions throughout the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> mentioned the drop in value of our overseas exports. The very same thing happened in 1929. History is repeating itself. When we say that the Government has not taken the necessary steps to remedy the position, we are ridiculed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> mentioned the promise of the Labour party to eliminate the means test. I challenge any Government supporter in this chamber, or in another place, to quote one promise made by the Labour party during an election campaign that was not fulfilled when we came to office. Long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> had grown his political teeth, we heard exactly the same kind of criticism from his party. </para>
                        <para>During the war years, the Labour government introduced widows' pensions and unemployment and sickness benefits, and raised other social service benefits. The Opposition of the day laughed at us and said that the provision of such benefits was impossible, but we provided them. To fulfil the promises we now make would be as nothing compared to what we did during the war. </para>
                        <para>In order to illustrate my point regarding the economy of the country, I shall read a paragraph from an article by a leader of the Labour party of whom we all are very proud. This particular man was chided over and over again, particularly by members of the Liberal party, for his financial policies. </para>

Every one of them will live in history to the great credit of this country. It is with great gratification, pride and joy that I stand here, still a supporter of men who steered this country through its greatest crisis after a Liberal government had run away from its responsibility.

                        <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was Treasurer he would not issue unlimited credit unless he had some control over it and was able to channel the money into reproductive work. Because he kept controls on so that money could be channelled into reproductive work, he was criticised from one end of the country to the other by the predecessors of the gentlemen who occupy the benches on the other side of the Senate to-day. Although they jibed at him, nobody can say that under the financial policy of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> there was a degree of inflation in any way harmful to this country. Immediately he went out of office, inflation began to increase under the present Liberal Government, and it has been running riot ever since. It has now reached breaking point. </para>
                        <para>If this Government had been doing its job, it would by now have enough revenue stored up to enable it to meet the situation that is confronting Australia to-day. but it is not ready to meet the situation.

                        <para>I give a complete denial to the honorable senator opposite who said that we do not want to bring immigrants to this country. We believe in bringing as many immigrants to the country as we can possibly get. T am sure that honorable senators will agree that when we were in charge of the affairs of this country, we scoured the world for ships to bring immigrants to Australia, but before the immigrants landed here we made perfectly sure that there were jobs to which they could go. There are 67,000 unemployed people in Australia at the present time. It is certain that many of them are immigrants whom the present Government brought to the country. They were brought here under a misrepresentation. If we were in office, we would bring in immigrants up to the figure of 1 15,000 a year but we would see that there was a job waiting for each and every one of them when he arrived. Nobody can really say that we are opposed to immigration when we are prepared to do that, but we would control interest rates and channel the enormous amount of surplus cash that is available here into the right channels so that it could be used for the benefit of the country and provide jobs for immigrants and others. </para>

However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> has been in this Parliament long enough to have checked the history of the Labour Government. He knows what Labour did during the war years in relation to social services, health  services and other such things. He knows perfectly well that it would be no hardship for a Labour government to lift the means test completely. He is merely trying to get in early before the election in an attempt to ridicule the policy of the Labour party. The fact is that honorable senators opposite did promise to progressively lift the means test, but that promise will not be honoured until many of us have passed on to the great beyond, and perhaps not even then. It is one of the principles that they claim to support but which they are not prepared to put into effect. </para>

Apart from referring to those two things, he had' little or nothin" at all to say in regard to the Budget. M-nv savings could have been made bv the Government. If honorable senators opposite read the Auditor-General's report, they wi!' not have to ask me where savings could he made. They could be made, for instance, in the administration of closer settlement. I am not contending that the policy of closer settlement should not be continued. I had to put up a fight here for some time on behalf of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Shea,</inline> whom I claimed was badly treated, and at this stage I want to thank the Minister for conceding to my request, calling the dogs off and withdrawing all his actions against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Shea.</inline> The little bit of money that was involved in that case is a drop in the ocean compared with the money that could be saved in other directions. </para>

AfterI had been successful in my fight for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Shea,</inline> and had obtained for him the kind of justice that he fought for in the last war, I received the following letter from the secretary of the King Island Soldier Settlers Association.

                            <para>. - Two years ago I asked the Senate to withdraw permission for the broadcasting of proceedings of the Parliament, but unfortunately my motion was never brought to a vote. As I listened to the speeches from the other side of the Senate to-night, I felt more and more that I was right in my action then. It is nauseating for people to listen to such tripe and trash, which not even faintly resembles the truth. </para>
