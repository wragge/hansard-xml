                        <para>-  I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs whether it is a fact that a Mr. R. E. G. Cunningham has stated that whilst the Colombo plan is a necessity, Australia has wasted millions of pounds on impractical aid to Pakistan, ls it also a fact that the Minister for External Affairs has denied the charge? Further, is it a fact that Mr. Cunningham has renewed his charge, and stated in the " Sun-Herald " of Sunday last that 215 tractors, worth about £3,000 each, and huge ploughs and combines sent from Australia would never be used on Pakistan farms; that each farm consists of a few acres divided into small plots surrounded by low earth banks, and that mechanical equipment is useless on these small plots of land? Is it a fact also that the Australian High Commissioner in Pakistan has reported on these matters to the Minister? If so, will the Minister make the report available to honorable senators? </para>

                        <para>-  On the same subject, I ask the Leader of the Government whether his attention has been drawn to the serious adverse publicity directed to the contribution of the Menzies Government to the Colombo plan. Is it a fact that farm equipment is rusting on dumps, and that in some cases natives have dismantled harvesters and reapers to make knives and other implements from the steel? What experience qualified the diplomatic staff to supply such equipment as tractors and diesel-electric machinery which is being stripped while lying in the open? Will the Government consider the appointment of an all-party committee of Parliament, to include farmers and other practical men, to visit South-East Asia so that the needs of each country in that area may be examined with a view to avoiding the present wastage of farm and other equipment that could be used to advantage in Australia, and providing food so badly needed in portions of South-East Asia? </para>

                            <para>-  I have read what purports to be the criticism of Mr. Cunningham of Australia's contribution to the Colombo plan, and I have also read the reply of my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, who, I think, adequately and completely disposed of the allegations made by Mr. Cunningham and proved them to be without foundation. I am not aware of any other criticism that has been levelled at the administration by Australia of contributions to the Colombo plan. I am aware, however, that the best available brains - commercial, industrial, grazing and farming - were consulted, both here and abroad, as to the form assistance by Australia under the Colombo plan should take. 1 can quite appreciate that it must be very hurtful to honorable senators opposite to learn how well we are doing in our contribution. </para>

                        <para>-  I preface a question directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer  by  stating that a discussion has recently taken place in the House of Commons relating to the establishment of a bank for the British Commonwealth of Nations. It was stated that the Commonwealth , would wane unless its economic strength continued to increase. The " Daily Express " declared that a bank for the British Empire should cease to  be  a mere idea and should now become a definite plan. Can the Minister inform  me  whether any discussions have taken place between the nations of the British Commonwealth on this matter? If they have, does this proposal meet with the approval of the  Australian  Government? </para>

                        <para>-  My understanding of the position is that something in the nature of an informal debate has taken place in the House of Commons, but there has been no government decision upon the matter in the United Kingdom- That being so, there would not have been any representations made  by  the United Kingdom Government to the Australian Government, and it would  be  premature to express any views until  we see  exactly what the proposal,  if  any,  is. </para>

                        <para>-  By way of preface to a question addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, I should like to point out that a large woollen mill in Launceston, Tasmania - that of Patons and Baldwins Limited - has found it necessary to reduce its working week to four days because of the very intense competition it has to meet as the result of the importation of Japanese textiles. In the southern part of Tasmania, the textile printing industry is in dire straits because of the inadequacy of orders from its normal customers. This reduction in orders is due to uncertainty as to what quotas will be allowed into Australia from Japan. Is the Minister aware that the delay in presenting to Parliament the Tariff Board's report on the textile and textile printing industry in Australia is causing gave concern to the manufacturers and loss of employment to workers engaged in the textile industry? Is it a fact that the report was completed some time ago and is now in the hands of the Minister awaiting consideration by the Government? As this delay is costing both workers and employers many thousands of pounds, will the Minister indicate when the report will be presented to Parliament and when the recommendations contained in it will be implemented? </para>

                        <para>-  I have to admit that I do not know the circumstances regarding this report. I do not even know whether it has been completed by the Tariff Board and presented to the Minister. However, I assume from the honorable senator's question that he has knowledge that it has been completed, and I accept his assurance on that point. But I ask him not to urge over-speedy or incomplete consideration of a report such as this because I know the difficulties and the problems that have to be considered in connexion with reports of this kind. I also know how carefully my colleague, Mr. McEwen, considers the views of the Tariff Board before putting proposals before the Government. I suggest to the honorable senator that the best thing to do in the circumstances is to assure those who are concerned that, in their own interests, the matter will be, indeed I have no doubt it is, receiving mature consideration from the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that I can answer the honorable senator only in general terms. We are very short indeed of nickel ore and the discovery of deposits in Australia, Papua or New Guinea would be of national significance. When I was in Port Moresby recently, specific arrangements were being made to investigate reported nickel ore deposits in that area. I am afraid that I have no information concerning the reported deposits at Beaconsfield. As the honorable senator is aware, mining and related matters are primarily the responsibility of the State Government. The Bureau of Mineral Resources is meticulous in not encroaching upon the activities of State departments of mines. I am sure that the bureau would not investigate the position at Beaconsfield without first receiving a specific request from the Tasmanian Department of Mines. I do not know whether that has happened, and 1 have no knowledge of the Beaconsfield area. I shall obtain what information I can and pa.°s it to the honorable member. </para>

In view of the fact that the ever-increasing cost of basic commodities and services reacts unfavorably against pensioners and persons on fixed incomes, will the Government give early consideration to liberalizing the income test, and thus allow pensioners to supplement their pensions to a greater degree than is now permissible? </para>

If the sale has been finalized, does the Minister agree that Australia and the Australian wheat industry might well benefit from such trade? Does the Minister agree that this deal may well have been lost to Australia, and that similar deals in the future might also be lost because we have no representation of any kind on Formosa? Does he further agree that our present practice of relying on our representative in the Philippines to cover our trade interests in Formosa has been shown, by this example, to be quite inadequate? If the Minister cannot give me a detailed reply now, 1 ask him whether he would be good enough to bring my questions to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Trade. </para>

Is it a fact that, under the Colombo plan, Australia is giving aid to our Asian friends? If so, could not butter consignments be included in our contribution to that aid? Does not charity begin at home, and should not some of our export butter quota be made available at the English price to age pensioners who, according to recent articles in the Melbourne press, are suffering grave malnutrition as a result of lack of butter fat? </para>

In relation to the honorable senator's inquiry as to the fate of pensioners and the way the Government is treating them, I can only repeat what my colleague, Senator Spooner, said a rittle time ago. Year by year this Government has taken care of the pensioners and has seen that adequate increases have been made of pension rates. </para>

What are the geographical limits of Australia's claim to territory in Antarctica and the adjoining ocean? What are the circumstances upon which Australia's claim to such territory is based?

If so, was the base established with the consent of the Australian Government? Has the Australian Government any information on the numbers of personnel at the Soviet base? Finally, has the Government any evidence to suggest that the base is being used for other than scientific purposes - possibly in conjunction with the deployment of Soviet submarines? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to direct a question to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. With your permission, Sir. and with the concurrence of the Senate, I shall make a brief statement in order that the purport of my question will be understood. For some years in South Australia there have been long delays in the installation of telephones in residences and business houses after applications have been lodged with the Postmaster-General's Department in Adelaide. Let me say that I honestly believe that the South Australian branch, at any rate, of the Postmaster-General's Department, is doing all it can to overcome the difficulty, As far back as last October the general manager of a plywood mill in a thickly populated part of one of the suburbs of Adelaide told me he had lodged an application with the department six months previously for a telephone to be installed at his place of residence. To date, a telephone has not been installed. I am sure the Senate will appreciate the danger of fire and other risks that are associated with a timber mill. Therefore, I ask the Minister, first, whether he is aware that in South Australia many applications for telephone installations have been lodged for six or even twelve months but that telephones have not yet been installed. Secondly, will he say whether the technical and material shortages which have been given as the reason for such delay have been overtaken? Thirdly, are large quantities of materials and equipment necessary for telephone installations being imported?  Fourthly, if such materials are being imported, why? </para>

                        <para>- The Government is aware that there is some delay in the installation of telephones. However, the delay at the present time is far less than it was one, two, or even three years ago;, it has been greatly reduced. In the past, some delay was caused by the lack of materials, but 1 understand that problem has been overcome. The honorable senator has related the experience of a certain' person. I suggest that the honorable senator get in touch with the Director of Postsand Telegraphs in South Australia- </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Earlier this year, tobacco-growers in north-eastern Victoria suffered serious losses just before picking because of disastrous hailstorms. It is estimated that the losses in the Myrtleford and Ovens Vale areas near Wangaratta amounted to about £60,000. As the tobacco-growing industry is a big revenue producer for the Commonwealth Government, will the Minister give some financial assistance to those growers whose financial return for this year's harvest has been seriously affected and thus assist them to plant next year's crop, from which no doubt the Government will derive considerable revenue in due course? </para>

                        <para>- lt is true that, when the child of a war widow reaches the age of sixteen years, certain benefits are lost; but, on the other hand, if the child is proceeding to higher education, the child's allowance is very materially increased. Up to two years ago, when a child reached the age of sixteen years the widow's pension reverted to the ordinary rate; she did not get the domestic allowance.  But  this Government saw the need to give widows something extra to help them along, and the act was amended to provide that, when a child proceeded to higher education, an education allowance would be paid to the widow until the child was earning. That meant that, in the case of a child going on to a university, the domestic allowance would be paid for six or seven years after the child had reached the age of sixteen years. I know that representations have been made in regard to dental treatment. The matter is under consideration, and if we can help war widows in this direction I am certain that we shall do so- </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry seen an article published in a pamphlet, issued at Canberra by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, criticizing the change-over, in respect of the fixation of the f.a.q. standard for wheat, from the corn trade section of the chambers in each city to the Australian Wheat Board? Was this action taken because the service performed by the various chambers of commerce was unsatisfactory, or is it a prelude to a new system which will lead to a better classification of Australian wheat? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I have seen the article to which the honorable senator refers. I did not gain the impression that the change-over was made because of any degree of dissatisfaction with the service performed in the past by the chambers of commerce. I am not, however, familiar with all the details of the reasons for the change-over, and, that being so, I shall refer this question to the Minister for Primary Industry and let the honorable senator have a reply as soon as possible. </para>

By way of preface, I produce a publication on the front page of which are photographs of the Minister for Trade and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Trade. Invariably, with these publications, the early pages are adorned by photographs of the Minister and departmental heads- In fact, such photographs are now nearly as common as is the parrot on the " Rosella " jam label. I now ask the appropriate Minister: What Commonwealth departments and ministerial and other such bodies issue publications? What is the number issued weekly or monthly? What is the cost, including the cost of materials and publication outlay? How many journalists are engaged in the preparation and publication of these journals, and what is the yearly cost involved in  this respect? How many persons other than journalists are engaged, and what is the annual cost? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, from his past ministerial experience, might well know that most careful procedures are laid down to ensure that none of these publications is lightly authorized. Neither a Minister nor a department may issue a publication unless full details of it have first been submitted to a committee representing the major departments, including the Treasury and the Prime Minister's Department. I assure the honorable senator that the fact that that committee has given its approval to the publication of a journal is an indication that the journal is well worth while. As to whether any one could answer all the questions the honorable senator has asked, I do not know. I shall make some inquiries to see whether it is possible to answer them, but I shall certainly not allow a situation to be reached in which a flock of clerks would be needed to supply information of no interest to anybody other than Senator Ashley.</para>

               <para> (a) Section 107 of Division 2 of Part VII. of the Social Services Act provides that to qualify for unemployment benefit persons must be capable of undertaking work of a type that is considered to be suitable for them. When claiming benefit they are required to make a declaration that they are capable of undertaking and willing to undertake work. Persons who cannot make this declaration do not qualify for unemployment benefit but may produce the necessary certification of temporary incapacity from a legally qualified medical practitioner and apply for sickness benefit, (b) At all times when dealing with persons claiming or in receipt of unemployment benefit, officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service are careful to take into account any disabilities these persons may have that could affect their ability to work. Persons who have such disabilities are afforded the special facilities which the Commonwealth Employment Service provides to assist the physically handicapped to obtain suitable positions. By arrangement with the Department of Social Services, persons who, because of their disabilities, are likely to continue without work, are referred to that department which considers whether rehabilitation treatment or training should be given, whether they should receive an invalid pension or whether some other suitable action should be taken. </para>

                    <para class="block">Comprehensive inquiries were made into the proposal to erect the new power station, and the evidence showed that Darwin will tend to grow increasingly as a commercial centre. A vigorous building programme of both government and private premises is proceding, new banks are being erected,  and  confidence is felt that the rice project and metalliferous ore production in the hinterland will be very important features of the commercial life of Darwin in the future, these being superimposed on the basic primary industries of the Territory. </para>
                    <para>The field of inquiry covered the various types of electricity generation, and opinions <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> given to the committee on the efficacy of diesel engines, gas turbines, free power gasifiers, hydro-electric power and nuclear power. It was of great interest to the com  mittee  to learn that, for the first time, a genuine case can be put forward for the future introduction into Australia of nuclear power. Alhough larger areas could be economically served by nuclear power stations, generators of the size required in Darwin, to the extent of upwards of 15,000 kilowatts, are not a commercial or economic proposition at the present time. </para>
                    <para>After wide investigation the committee decided that an oil-fired steam plant is most suitable for the generation of electricity to meet the immediate and future requirements of Darwin until about 1970. </para>

A report of  this  nature <inline font-style="italic">creates</inline> a good deal of interest in the question as to whether the Commonwealth Government should investigate the  field  of generation by nuclear power, or whether the orthodox methods should be continued for a period. However, the committee recommended in the report that an oil-fired steam plant is the most suitable to meet the requirements of Darwin at the present time. </para>

                    <para>. - by leave - The following statement was made in another place by the Prime Minister to-day: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>The House will recall that, when I made my statement on Defence organization recently, I said that arrangements were in progress to amalgamate the Departments of Supply and Defence Production into a single Department of Supply. </para>
                    <para>By Executive Council action taken last week, that amalgamation is now complete. Henceforth, the Department of Supply will, in addition to its  own existing functions, carry out the functions of what was formerly the Department of Defence Production, that department having been abolished. </para>
                    <para>My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Townley,</inline> will continue to be Minister for Supply. There will be no major change in his administrative responsibilities, although he will relinquish responsibility for the Aluminium Production Commission to the Minister for National Development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Townley</inline> will continue his present ministerial duties under the single title of Minister for Supply instead of under his former dual titles of Supply and Detence Production. </para>
                    <para>For the present, as 1 have announced, the Minister for Air will continue to act as Minister for Supply until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Townley's</inline> return from abroad. </para>
                    <para>The amalgamation of the two departments has resulted in a reduction of 64 positions, which means savings of £80,000 per annum. These are chiefly administrative. </para>
                    <para>The special Commonwealth Gazette recording the abolition of the department lists the abolished positions. These savings are real and indeed the reduction has already occurred, because in anticipation of the amalgamation, the departments and the Public Service Board over the last few months have co-operated to avoidfilling jobs as they fell vacant. </para>
                    <para>The savings to be gained in the administrative field from amalgamation are not extensive immediately, because a substantial degree of common service has always operated between the two departments. However, in other fields there will be other and larger savings. For instance, savings of the order of £100,000 per annum should eventuate from the operation of combining the stores function, which is already under way. </para>
                    <para>Also, as I said in my earlier statement in this House, Cabinet has decided that the work of the Aircraft Maintenance Branch, formerly in the Department of Defence Production, should be limited to the allocation and planning of essential production and resources, leaving the Royal Australian Air Force to order directly from suppliers of services and spare parts. By this and other means, and by reducing the substantial store holdings, a saving of the order of £250,000 per annum is expected. </para>
                    <para>Other economies can be expected to arise from unified control, as the new organization shakes down and duplicated services are eliminated. We shall pursue these possibilities energetically. </para>
                    <para>These arrangements have coincided with the conclusion of a thorough-going re-examination of the functions of departments as expressed in the Administrative Arrangements Order. The Administrative Arrangements Order is a formal document of State. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which has devoted some useful attention to the order, understood this and expressed the view that the primary legal purpose of the order is to identify the Minister in whom a power is vested, and that the secondary legal purpose is to provide evidence, where necessary, in legal proceedings that the power has been exercised by the appropriate Minister. </para>
                    <para>The order has a history running back to the early days of federation. It was first issued in 1906, and the last general revision was made in 1951. The Constitution provides that the Governor-General may appoint Ministers to administer such departments of the Commonwealth as he may establish. </para>
                    <para>The statements which now appear in the second column of the order are simple in form, and are intended to indicate the general functions of each department, without being so specific as to appear to give authority to departments to carry out any functions without reference to higher authority. </para>
                    <para>Authorizations to carry out any part of these functions must be found elsewhere, as in specific legislation of this Parliament, or in government decisions supported by Appropriation Acts, or by the approval of funds by the Treasurer. This also the Public Accounts Committee recognizes in its Report of 1953. </para>
                    <para>The third column of the order sets out, by departments, the administrative responsibility for acts of Parliament. It will be kept up to date by regular amendments to indicate the administrative responsibility for new acts. Honorable members will note that in its new form the order adheres more closely to constitutional terms. </para>
                    <para>Furthermore, with a form of words so general it will be necessary from time to time to make interpretations or to establish demarcation lines between the functions of departments. This is a function of the Prime Minister, and I shall carry it out by letter to Ministers as necessary. </para>
                    <para>His Excellency the Governor-General has approved the new Administrative Arrangements Order, which includes the enlargement of the functions of the Department of Supply. Copies are available for honorable members. </para>

As honorable senators will have noticed, this clause is a very extensive one, running over many pages of the bill, and it includes the definition provisions. If I were to proceed immediately with the amendment I now have before the committee, the Minister would be debarred from proposing an amendment to an earlier provision in the clause until the clause was recommitted for further reconsideration.

                    <para>. - When the committee adjourned last night we were discussing sub-sections (2.) and (3.) of proposed section 6e. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> moved an amendment designed to delete sub-sections (2.) and (3.). A long debate ensued, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> expressed great apprehension as to the extent of the discretion which was to be given to the port superintendent in determining disputes as to the proper return port. Overnight and this morning I have had a chance to re-consider the whole matter, and am now prepared to accept the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> In doing so, I point out that the Government still has in mind the possibility of a dispute over the determination of the proper return port as between the port from which a seaman ships and the port which is, in effect, his home port. In order to cover that situation I propose to move that sub-sections (2.) and (3.) be omitted and that the following sub-sections be inserted in their stead: -  (2.) A master, seaman or apprentice, and the owner of a ship, may agree to refer a question which has arisen between them as to the proper return port of the master, seaman or apprentice to a proper authority for his decision. (3.) Section 81 of this act applies to, and in relation to, such an agreement as if it were an agreement to which that section applies, and the reference in that section to a superintendent were a reference to a proper authority. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It will be seen that proposed sub-section (2.) restricts the authority of the superintendent to the determination of a matter of fact - as to what is the proper return port. That provision, and proposed sub-section (3.), where it refers to section 81 which, in turn, relates to the reference of differences to the superintendent, will, I think, cover the situation. These provisions will meet the strong objection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and should give fairly general satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>. -  On behalf of the Opposition I should like to express my appreciation of the Minister's objective approach to the very strong arguments addressed to him yesterday. It is very gratifying to find him open to argument in that way. The obnoxious clauses will be deleted. That is the first, and most important, thing. The Minister is surely now qualified for membership of the Diplomatic Corps because he has met the objections of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> has accepted the excellent suggestion - put in a sentence - by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> and has met the wishes of the Opposition. The objection from the union was of a major kind. It was one of the major matters which disturbed its members - that a man could be returned otherwise than to his proper return port. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The whole of the machinery considered objectionable has gone. I should like to put my understanding of the matter to the Minister for confirmation. The proper return port - under the proposed law - will be either the port of engagement or the port agreed upon between the master and the seaman as the home port. The Minister envisages a possible argument over this matter when a ship is abroad. It is not likely to arise where the port of engagement is deemed to be the proper return port. Where there is an agreement to the contrary, there could be a difference of opinion as to what has been agreed upon. I take it that that is what the Minister envisages, and that he now proposes that if the seaman and the master are in dispute they may agree to refer the matter to a proper authority for final determination. Section 81, to which the Minister has referred, and which clause 54 of the bill amends, provides for a reference to a superintendent and also that, by agreement, his decision shall be final. The Minister proposes, in sub-section (2.), to incorporate those provisions in the bill - substituting the term " proper authority " for the term " superintendent ". I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the views put to him on this particular matter and see no objection at all to the new subclauses proposed. </para>

I understand that there is some general concurrence that the committee should address its mind to amendments, proposed by senators, or to cases in which a senator indicates that he wishes to oppose, by vote, a particular clause. That would enable the remaining matters to be disposed of far more satisfactorily in the limited time available. Accordingly, I move: - </para>

If the honorable senator will look at sub-section  (2.),  dealing with permits, he will see that it refers to foreign-going ships only .when it refers to a master.

                        <para>-  No, I am not. If the honorable senator will look at the first part of sub-section  (2.),  he will see that it provides -that if the only thing that prevents a .man from getting a certificate is 'the fact that he is not a British subject, the Minister may -.discard that requirement and issue .him with a .permit. </para>

Of course, the Minister would be satisfied that he could speak and write English and act intelligibly in that language. I ask this question before I proceed: Are there any reciprocal arrangements as to the recognition by Australia of certificates of competency granted in foreign countries, or is the only way to qualification through examination? If a highly qualified person coming from abroad seeks to take a ship out of Australia and can be deemed to be qualified, I think we have gone a bit too far in making this provision available for the benefit of new Australians. The purpose of the Opposition's amendment is to ensure that anyone who takes such a responsible post as that of senior officer of a ship at least should have some base in Australia. </para><interjection>

I wanted to be assured that we were protected in the situation in which a qualified foreign master or mate might come to Australia and immediately take charge of a ship without ever having shown his form in this country. Did I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> to say that a person may offer for examination in a Commonwealth country without being resident in Australia? I understood the honorable senator to say that, but I may have misheard him. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise only because my understanding of the situation is quite different. I should like to be corrected if I am wrong. Proposed section 17 provides that a person shall not be admitted to examination for a certificate unless he is a British subject or has been continuously resident in Australia for twelve months, and complies with certain other  Conditions.  Section 18 of the act provides for the issue of a certificate, proposed section 19 is a formal section, and proposed section 18a is to be sandwiched between them. 1 should have thought that the purpose of proposed section 18a (1.) was to make it quite clear that a certificate as extra master, master of a foreign-going ship, first mate of a foreign-going ship, extra first-class engineer or first-class engineer shall not be delivered to a person who is not a British subject. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I should have thought, too, that the purpose of proposed section 18a (2.) was to qualify sub-section (l.) and to enable the Minister to give a permit to a person otherwise unqualified by reason of residence or British nationality and that, for the purpose of the act, the holder of such a permit was to be deemed to be the holder of a certificate. I would have read these provisions as authorizing, by permit, an unqualified person to assume all the rights of a certificated master although he was not yet qualified to sit for the examination or had not passed it. That is my understanding of proposed section 18a. If I am wrong, I should like to be corrected. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps what I am about to say will help honorable senators to see whether anything is wrong with the proposed legislation. Let us take the case of a foreigner who holds a foreign master's certificate and who comes to Australia. As he is not a British subject, under proposed section 17 (a) he must wait for a year in this country before he can take any further steps. If, after having lived in Australia for twelve months, he can prove that he has had five and a half years' service at sea in any capacity at all, he is entitled, under the rules of examination, which are set down by the Board of Trade and are copied in Australia, to sit for the examination for second mate. Having passed that examination, he is entitled to apply for a position on the coast. He would probably be accepted as third mate or fourth mate, but certainly not as second mate. He would then have to serve a further eighteen months in a foreign-going or interstate vessel, or 27 months in local coast trade, before he could sit for the examination for first mate. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Having sat for the examination for his first mate's certificate, he then applies for a job. If he stays with the same company he may perhaps be promoted to second mate, and having served for yet another eighteen months, he could sit for his master's certificate. Having passed the master's examination, he would then be eligible to accept a position as master, but it is most unlikely that he would get one at that stage. Probably, he would be promoted to first mate of a ship, and over the years, by the effluxion of time, he would be promoted to master. But the shortest time in which anybody coming to this country could possibly reach the position where he was likely to sail as a master would be one year, plus eighteen months, plus another eighteen months, plus the wasted time when he was studying for examinations. Thus, it would &gt;be very close to the end of the five-year period before he became eligible for naturalization that he would be in a position to ask the Minister for a permit. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that that only takes it a step further and means that, until such time as he is naturalized, he can hold a permit to sail as first mate. That provision does not alter the position that I have already described. I suggest that such a man would be very fortunate to obtaina position: as first. mate -I am speaking: of actual practice, not of. the legal position- in less than three or four years. </para>

                <para>I interpret those words to mean that if he is qualified so far as his examinations are concerned, if he is able to speak English intelligibly and to write it intelligibly, if he has all the other qualifications, and that the only qualification that is lacking is that he is not British, then, and then only, may the Minister issue a permit. </para>

If the one disability that he has is that he is neither British nor naturalized, the Minister is free to issue a permit. The Minister might indicate whether or not he agrees with that interpretation. </para>

I propose to move them separately because I think that the Minister has some thoughts on the matter. The first amendment, which I have foreshadowed, proposes to omit the words " or seamen's inspector " from paragraph (a). On the information that has been supplied" to me; I understand that the office of seamen's inspector is really a dead letter. I am given to understand that there is only one of the kind leftin captivity in Australia: He is somewhere in Melbourne.

                <para class="block">Sub-section (2.) gets over the. difficulty, but it might be very burdensome if a man had. to get. a certificate for every engagement. The sub-section provides that a certificate shall hold goodfor twelve month's, and that is a very common-sense provision. However, the sub-section is to be repealed. It was not readily apparent what was happening, and the Opposition was concerned lest young people should not be medically examined. I need not pursue that topic now for the reason that, at the second-reading stage, the Minister indicated that proposed sections 123 and 124 were satisfactory. If honorable senators will turn to the bill, they will see that sub-sections (1.) and (2.) of proposed section 124 provide -  (1.) The regulations may make provision for or in relation to the medical examination of, and the issue of certificates of fitness to, masters, seamen and apprentices and persons proposing to engage in employment as masters or seamen or to become apprentices. (2.) The regulations made by virtue of the last preceding sub-section may include provisions prohibiting the engagement of a person as a master or seaman, or the taking of an apprentice to sea, unless he is the holder of a certificate issued under those regulations. </para>
                <para class="block">We go from a position where regular medical examinations of seafarers up to the age of eighteen years were mandatory to a stage where power is taken to make regulations requiring everybody who goes to sea, whether under eighteen years or over, to be medically examined periodically. The provision really covers everybody; this is a power to legislate for everybody. That, of course, takes the matter out of the category of a statutory requirement and makes it a matter of executive discretion. That is the first point. </para>
                <para>The second point is that there should not be discrimination either between classes of seamen or between seamen according to ages. I understand from the Minister that the intention is to provide, pursuant to the Safety at Sea Convention of 1946, for the examination of everybody who goes to sea. That is a wise precaution. If I get the Minister's assurance that that is what is in the Government's mind - that although the question of medical examination now becomes a matter for the Executive Council, not a matter of statutory obligation, nevertheless the Government has in mind the making of regulations that will apply without discrimination to everybody who goes to sea - I shall feel no difficulty about the repeal of section 40b of the principal act. That would be wider than the present provision, but not as strong as a statutory power, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall.</inline></para>
                <para>At the moment, the obligation arises under the act in relation only to apprentices and those under eighteen years of age. Now there is to be power to make regulations in respect of everybody. Is the Minister able to assure the committee that this regulation will be promulgated and that it will be made applicable to everybody, whether under eighteen years or over, and without discrimination between officers and men and between the various categories of officers? </para>

                <para>The broad approach of the Opposition is that ifa complement is determined for a ship, that complement should be the minimum with which a ship should go to sea. The complement would be fixed not lightly but with due regard, not only to safety but also to economy in running. One must assume that very careful thought was given to the fixing of the complement. It seems extraordinary that some official, in this case a proper authority, is in a position to discard the complement that has been fixed and allow a ship to go to sea with four-fifths of the engine-room staff and four-fifths of the deck complement. If such a margin exists by which the complement of a ship may be reduced, the margin is far too wide. </para>
                <para>If my omission is not accepted, I shall put to the committee other matters as foreshadowed on page1 of the amendments I have circulated, and the committee will then have the opportunity of following the trend of my thoughts. </para>

                        <para>-  I am aware  of  that. I am merely informing the honorable senator of the practical side of the matter. Perhaps the Minister found it necessary to re-write the provision in order to make it plainer. When I was working on the Australian coast, we always operated on the four-fifths basis and no alteration  is  proposed in the proposed amendment. The number of people of different classes required to be carried on board ship is normally about one-fifth greater than  is  necessary to man the ship with safety. However, I realize that is not an argument in favour of theproposed amendment in the bill. I merely make the statement. </para>

                        <para>-  Over the years, we have always worked on the four-fifths basis, and I think the principal point contained in the argument of the Opposition is that only fourth-fifths of the necessary crew would be on board ship. The proposed amendment contains a slightly different form of authority expressed in different words. Frankly, I have not compared the proposed amendment in the bill with the original section sufficiently well to say exactly where the difference  lies,  but obviously a difference in wording exists. I make the point that we have always worked on the four-fifths basis. </para>

                    <para>. - The consideration that appears to have determined the inclusion of the section originally, or its re-writing in substantially the same terms in the proposed amendment, goes almost to a question of the convenience of those associated with the industry. For example, if the  Deputy-  Director of Navigation is satisfied that the owner of a ship has made reasonable attempts to obtain the complement of the ship, that should not be the final determining factor. The paramount consideration, which seems to have been omitted from the original act and from the proposed amendment, is the safe minimum complement with which the ship may go to sea. Perhaps a convention of the sea, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> states, is that a ship's nominal safe complement is, say, 100, but in fact the practical safe complement is 85. If, in a crisis, such a ship is allowed to go to sea with a complement of 85, the ship is in fact being allowed to go to sea with a practical safe complement which is below the legal safe complement. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>If the original section is to be re-written with variations, the significance of which elude me, we should at least take the opportunity of including in the amendment some provision to the effect that a deputy director shall have paramount consideration for the safety of the ship before he issues a permit for the ship to go to sea, and that such minor considerations, to my mind, as being satisfied that the owner has made reasonable attempts to obtain the required complement, should not be one of the factors specified in the act when so many more important considerations are not even mentioned. </para>
                <para>I should be reluctant to support the. proposed amendment in the bill unless in some way it brought to the forefront the considerations of safety and other factors- to be taken into account, which apparently have been omitted since 1912. Those matters come to mind after a very quick glance at the proposed section now under discussion. </para>

After certain matters are satisfied, authority i&amp; given, for a  deputy  director, or proper authority, to give a consent to a master's taking a ship to sea without the prescribed complement, but with not less than four-fifths of the- engine-room staff and four-fifths of the deck complement.

                <para>That is completely answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall's</inline> contribution which, from the practical point of view, invokes- legal reference to section 43 (8.) of the act itself. That sub-section specifically authorizes the taking of a ship to sea with not less than four-fifths of the engine-room staff and four-fifths of the. deck complement. Therefore, the basis upon which the amendment has been submitted to us is completely answered. </para>
                <para>Now I come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne.</inline> Anybody experienced in engineering processes knows that the designed strength of a project is at least, double the safe strength. I should think that anybody with the slightest acquaintance, with the prescribed manning of commercial- shipping- would, know that it does not err on the side of a skeleton crew-. I should think- also that it is a very safe inference that when the minimum of four-fifths was prescribed as the minimum permissible proportion of the crew to take a ship to sea, that was regarded as the safe margin of reduction. After certain proportions had been satisfied, and after reasonable steps had been taken to get the full complement required by law in most favorable circumstances; the law permitted the minimum safe complement. Therefore, if I may say so, I think one would be tendentious if one were to suppose that the four-fifths contained any element of unsafety </para>

                <para>Having answered those two objections to proposed sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.), let me see what solid foundation of law they do qualify. For that, I turn to the preceding sub-sections of proposed section 43. There one sees a provision that a ship shall not be taken to sea unless it carries the prescribed complement; that is, the complement that is fixed by regulation. Sub-section (2.) says that until the energy is developed to promote the regulation, the old schedule II. of the act will suffice and the legal complement shal be as provided in that schedule. When we get round to fabricating the regulation, the regulation will prevail. </para>
                <para>Then I come to sub-section (3.). 1 have referred before to the process contemplated therein. Easy is the descent to hell! I find here that the Minister may, by order - he is going to condescend to publish it in the " Gazette " - direct that, from and including a date specified in the order, the prescribed crew may be varied in the manner specified, or shall be the crew specified in the order. Proposed sub-section (4.) says that the Minister shall not make an order under sub-section (3.) unless the application has been referred for advice to a committee of advice appointed under section 424, and the committee has furnished advice to the Minister with respect to the application. The happy situation regarding sub-section (4.) is that the Minister is required to refer the question to the committee of advice, and he is bound not to act until the committee has furnished the advice; but, as for accepting the menu prepared by the committee of advice, the Minister is free to reject it or digest it as he pleases. So he can give the complete go-by under proposed sub-section (4.) to the committee of advice. </para>
                <para>For greater freedom, proposed subsection (5.) says that the order which the Minister makes substituting the new complement displacing the complement that has been fixed by the regulations shall not be within the category of those executive instruments that may be disallowed by either </para>
                <para class="block">House of Parliament. It will be remembered that we had a similar provision in the Commonwealth Police Bill, and that I then took the occasion to bring to the attention of the Minister in charge of that bill a submission that such orders should not escape the scrutiny of either House of Parliament that is disposed to review it, and perhaps disallow it. </para>
                <para>The fixation of the complement of a seagoing ship is determined, first, in accordance with the old schedule. By regulation, that may be completely altered. By ministerial order, that again may be completely changed. So we have not a very concrete foundation for the basis on which th? deputy director, or the proper authority, may give consent to the reduction of this complement to four-fifths because the possibility is not beyond one's imagination thai even in this Parliament in our lifetime, we will get Ministers who will double the complement now prescribed, and the four-fifths, in relation to that doubled complement, will be not ample but superfluous by the standards that we propose to permit. </para>
                <para>Having answered, on the basis of their submissions, the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> I want to make another point. When we look at the more fundamental basis of these provisions whereby the prescribed complement may be varied ad lib. by regulation, and by ministerial order that may not be revoked by either House of Parliament, and when we realize that it is possible that a Minister may double the complement to-morrow, or next year, it does not matter whether a complement is reduced to four-fifths. I should have been much more interested in an attempt to lay the foundations of something like a stable rule of law. </para>

                    <para>. - I am greatly moved by the very logical argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and merely add the suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition, and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> are not reading sub-section (8.) correctly. The argument of the Opposition so far has been based upon the hypothesis that a  deputy  director would be bound to authorize the taking of a ship to sea if four-fifths of the complement were available. The subsection does not say that. Four-fifths is the minimum proportion of the complement required of the master before a  deputy  director can give a favorable ruling. Nothing in the bill places an obligation on a  deputy  director to give consent if even 99 per cent. of the complement has been found. He may withhold it if only one man is missing. Therefore, the circumstances of each case would have to be considered in isolation and where, four-fifths of the crew being available, it was considered palpably safe for the ship to go to sea, permission would be granted. If it were palpably unsafe, the  deputy  director would be perfectly entitled to withhold permission, and I trust that he would do so. Therefore, the argument of the learned Leader of the Opposition is not on all fours with the meaning of the sub-section. The consent of the  deputy  director would surely be governed by circumstances. I think that my interpretation of the sub-section would be accepted by any lawyer. </para>

                    <para>.- The clauses seem to differ little from the provisions in the principal act. Since 1912 a  deputy  director has been entitled, by writing under his hand, to authorize a master to take a ship to sea with such crew as is specified in the authority, being a crew of not less than four-fifths of the engine room staff, and four-fifths of the deck complement. If proposed sub-section (8.) is such a serious blow at industrial conditions' I marvel that we have heard nothing of it before; that disasters have not resulted from the existence of the provision in earlier years. Of course, ships will not be taken away with only four-fifths of their complement unless there is a serious reason for so doing. I think that in most cases only one or two men would be absent. I am influenced by my knowledge of the industry at present when I say that I cannot imagine anything more gratifying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> and the people who control the seamen's union, than to be able to hold up a ship whenever they like merely by persuading one man to vanish. To any one who says that that would not be done, I say. " Go and see what is happening on the waterfront to-day. Find out what has happened with these people already." </para>

                <para>I would support the elimination of these proposals if it could be shown that safety was affected, but we have often had Labour governments since 1912, and they have apparently not seen fit to adopt that course. That being so, the provision cannot be as bad as all that. The removal of the proposed sub-section would allow certain people to sabotage this industry with the minimum of inconvenience to themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that we were considering this bill objectively. I do not want to embark upon side issues. I hopethat the Opposition will continue to present its case objectively. I do not want to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> into a field of disputation concerning a particular incident or ship. That would not be appropriate to this debate. Under proposed sub-section (10.) the provision requiring four-fifths of the complement will remain, but the skipper will have to take the risk. If he is prosecuted he must be able to show that he has four-fifths of the ship's complement, and that objection was not raised by a single member of the crew. I understand that that was provided in the old legislation also. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> that the repeal of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.) does no more than say that if there is a prescribed complement it shall be filled, and places on masters the onus of satisfying the court that the required safety margin existed. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not in a position to reply to the -honorable senator at the moment. One look's at so many of these provisions, both new and old, that it is difficult to say offhand whether any one is a new provision. 1 will examine the position and indicate to the 'honorable senator presently, if the debate continues, whether the paragraph to which he refers is new or not. It may be that proposed sub-section (10.) (c) is new, but I think it is very proper to provide that a ship shall not be taken to sea with less than its proper complement when one -man makes a formal objection in writing. I propose to move an amendment, when we are dealing with another clause, to ensure that everybody on a ship will know well 'beforehand whether the ship is going to sea without its full complement, so that they will be in a position to lodge such an objection. We are hot throwing overboard, in our proposal to delete sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.), the possibility of a ship going to sea with as little as four-fifths of its complement. We have left sub-section (10.) alone. A ship may go to sea without its full complement but, under that provision, the master takes a risk. </para>

                <para>The position is also safeguarded by the provision "tha't any person on the ship, whether an officer or ordinary member of the crew, can veto the sailing. The Opposition is content to rest upon that. We say that 'there Should be ho question of consent by the officers. The prescribed complement should be adhered to, but if a master takes his ship 'to sea without a full complement, he will have to stand up to the provisions of sub-section (10.), which we do not intend to oppose. </para>

I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is arguing for or against his amendment. He may be arguing that his amendment is bad and that he is keeping sub-section (10.) in to make his amendment .good. 'I do not know whether that is the purport of his argument or not. </para>
                <para>Assuming that it is not, let us pursue <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> argument a stage further. He says that even if -his amendment is bad, he has retained 'the virtue of the proposals in sub-section (10.). I -say, with great respect, that he -has not done so, because the_*provisions of sub-section .(-10.) are very different from the overall provisions of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.). Sub-section (10.) merely gives a master a defence "to a .prosecution. That is much different 'from the provision of sub-sections (7.), (80 and (9.). </para>
                <para>Sub-section (-10.) provides three conditions precedent to a defence. They are all complementary; that is to say, they must all be in existence 'before a defence is available to a master. They are not alternatives. I suggest that tha't reduces the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to an absurdity. All that would need to happen would be for one member of the crew to absent himself. </para>

                        <para>-  I am referring to sub-section (10.) (c). One member of the crew might be absent. A Communist.inspired member of the crew would only need to lodge a written objection with the master, and bang goes the master's defence. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is not so naive as to suggest that the Communist-inspired element in the -crew would omit to lodge a written protest in pursuance of sub-section (10.) (c), or to suggest the waiving of any possibility of a defence that the master might have in taking his ship to sea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> argument is without much substance; it would not have the effect that he claims. </para>

                <para>The defence that is available to the master is 'not ah alternative 'to the effective provisions of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.). If it is proper arid safe Tor a ship &gt;to be taken to sea with a lesser complement, why should the master be forced to go into a court and be placed in the onerous situation of having to prove a defence? What is wrong with having in the act a provision that is complementary to sub-section (10.) to enable a master to go to sea with a lesser complement if it is safe to do so and if some outside authority with knowledge and experience is prepared so to certify? That is a fairly reasonable proposal. </para>
                <para>The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> does not want sub-section (10.) to be omitted indicates, to my mind, that he thinks it is reasonable. If the provisions that he seeks to have deleted were deleted, the only provision behind which a master would be able to shelter would be sub-section (10.). But, as I have said, a schoolboy could get around that provision by lodging a protest in writing. </para>

                    <para>. -  I rise to rebut the Minister's suggestion that my arguments have been rebutted by supporters of the Government. I wish to indicate very briefly how very much stronger the position would be from the viewpoint of control if there was a sensible, rigid complement that had to be adhered to. Let us so provide in proposed section 43 (1 . ), and let us not break it down by allowing somebody to consent to weaken it. That is the Opposition's viewpoint. If, then, anybody took the risk and weakened the provision - I agree that an escape clause must be left - he would do so at his own peril. </para>

                <para>The Opposition is contending for a stronger position in regard to safety than is permitted under the proposed provisions. I put that in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> in particular, because he sought to elaborate the argument that there was nothing logical about the Opposition's approach. I say there could be no stronger position from the viewpoint of safety than the one taken by the Opposition - that is, a complete prohibition against going to sea without a complement. </para>
                <para>What is the use of fixing a complement with a margin which is not the real complement, and which is not a bare minimum? Surely the approach of the legislature ought to be to say that no ship shall go to sea without a specified minimum. Why does the Government wish to set the complement so high that four-fifths will still be safe? </para>

                        <para>- I, too, am talking about ships at sea. The Opposition will press the amendment on the basis of the argument I have submitted. We want to ensure the strongest possible position. We want a defined complement. We accept the position, that, if an emergency arises and a skipper takes a ship to sea, he must be able to prove the things that are set out in subsection (10.) - that he did not have less than four-fifths of the complement, that failure to get the crew was not due to any default or neglect on his part, and that no member of the crew objected. I think that is a proper precaution. This is one matter that the Opposition will press to a division. </para>

                    <para>.- I could understand the attitude of the official Opposition if it proposed to vote against not only sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.) but also sub-section (10.). I cannot understand how it can take a stand on the question of safety, say that it seeks the deletion of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.) because they would permit a ship to be taken out under unsafe conditions, and then say that it is in agreement with the retention of sub-section (10.), which would allow a ship to be taken out under almost identical conditions. I emphasize, therefore, that, so far as subsections (7.), (8.) and (9.) of proposed section 43 are concerned, they appear to me to envisage the same state of affairs as that covered by sub-section (10.). If the Opposition is agreeable to sub-section (10.), I cannot understand its objection to the other sub-sections that I have mentioned. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am particularly amazed to learn that the Opposition will take its stand on the responsibility of the master to determine to take the ship out. I think that that is obviously wrong. Let us suppose that there is a dispute on a ship which results in a certain part of the crew not being available. I suggest that, frequently, the master is involved in such disputes. There can be arguments, hot words and all kinds of happenings, and his judgment, because of the circumstances in which he is involved, may not be the best judgment at the moment. Rather than cast responsibility on the master, who is concerned in the matter, would it not be better to say, " Since this is a question of safety, we shall not leave it in the hands of a person who is concerned. We shall place it in the hands of a responsible outside authority "? If that were done, instead of only one person making a decision which affected safety, there would be two persons making the decision. Instead of having a person concerned in the dispute making the decision, it would be made by a person in authority who was entirely dissociated from the circumstances. 1 was under the impression that, originally, the Opposition opposed any suggestion that a ship should be taken to sea without its full complement, but we now have been told that the Opposition agrees to sub-section (10.), which provides that, in certain circumstances, a ship may go to sea with only four-fifths of the complement. I must confess that .1 am unable to agree with the rest of the argument of the Opposition. It seems to me that once the validity of subsection (10.) is conceded, the Opposition concedes its whole argument in this respect: </para>

                    <para>.- I' express appreciation of the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> and illustrated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent.</inline> To prevent a boycott because of the absence of crew, provision is made for a master, with the approval of the proper authority, to take a vessel to sea with only four-fifths of its complement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> objects to that reduction, although the absence of one man could cause a boycott of a ship. In answer to that argument, the validity of which seemed to impress the honorable senator, he put forward an argument which seemed to amuse him. I say that because he appeared to be tickled by the conclusion to which he had driven himself. Let us suppose that one man was absent, so that there was not the prescribed crew. Then, by virtue of sub-section (10.), in which the honorable senator found great merit, any member of the crew then on board, and drawing wages while the ship was idle, could lodge an objection in writing and continue the boycott. There is something new that I want to add to this debate. I rise, despite the fact that by doing so we may not be able to have a division before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. However, I feel that it is of great importance that we should understand this matter. An argument has been submitted by the Opposition, carefully planned and circulated, for the elimination of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.) of proposed section 43. But not one single reference has been made to section 44 of the act. As 1 pointed out in my previous speech, no reference has been made by the Opposition to sub-sections (1.) to (6.) of proposed section 43. I- want to point to the subsequent context; contained in proposed section 44. I may be wrong, but my intuition tells me- that the original section 44 was incorporated in the act in 1952, following negotiations by the Minister for Labour and National Service of the day, and after the. measure had passed through this chamber under the guidance of the. late, revered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George.</inline> McLeay. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Proposed section 44 adds something to the prescribed complement requirements, because it provides that if the number of seamen of a particular description ordinarily carried on a ship in the coasting trade is greater than the number of seamen required by virtue of sub-section (1.) of proposed section 43; if the number of seamen of that description ordinarily carried have not been obtained; and if an officer or other member of the crew has lodged with the master an objection in writing to the ship being taken to sea from a port specified in the objection with less than the number of seamen of that description ordinarily carried on the ship; then notwithstanding that the prescribed crew for the ship is carried, the master shall not take the ship from the port unless a deputy director gives consent and the consent is posted up. </para>
                <para>Sub-section (2.) of proposed section 44 provides that a deputy director is not to give his consent unless he is satisfied that all reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the number of seamen of the particular description ordinarily carried on a ship. So, there is no recognition by the Opposition of the fact that, in 1952, we inserted these provisions to prohibit the exit to sea of a ship unless the ordinary complement was carried, even though that complement exceeded the legally prescribed complement. Now, despite the fact that proposed section 44 contemplates retention of the requirements relating to ships carrying their ordinary complement, we have submitted to us the argument that, to permit the legally prescribed complement to be reduced to four-fifths, with the consent of a deputy director, would be a shattering blow to navigational safety on the coast of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- When this matter was in its earlier stages of discussion I raised the question of safety, because I felt that some provision should' be inserted with a view to raising the matter to the point- of vital consideration that it should receive, in' preference to other factors. I thank, the Minister for directing' attention to subsequent sections of the principal act, in which the matter of seaworthiness of ships is referred to. It seems that a  deputy  director must take those provisions into consideration or suffer the pains and penalties of disregarding them by granting a permit for a ship to move to sea with less than its ordinary complement. 1 should be pleased if the Minister would advert to the reason for proposing to write in to the legislation sub-section (10.) (c). This appears to me to be an important matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has cast some light on it by his latest contribution to the discussion. He pointed out that a ship that ordinarily carried a certain complement could not move out to sea with less than that complement if any seaman objected in writing to that being done. 1 do not know whether or not that is a new provision. I take it that sub-section (10.) (c) is in the nature of a complementary provision to that already in existence, but it appears to me to embody an extraordinarily important principle. It was discussed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> and adverted to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent,</inline> in relation to circumstances in which there could be a sinister attempt to hold up a ship. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I roseprior to the suspension- of the sitting for dinner to deal with the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition- designed to omit sub-sections (7.), (8.), and (9.) of proposed section 43, and to thank the Minister for his explanation on the question of whether or not adequate provision was madefor the decision of a  Deputy  Director to allow a ship to proceed to sea with four-fifths of its complement. The- Minister kindly explained the significance of the provision to ensure safety. I also asked the Minister to explain the reason for writing in, apparently for the first time, the provision contained in sub-section (10.) (c), which provides that if an officer or- other member of the crew of the ship did not lodge with the master of the ship an objection in writing to the ship being, taken to sea, this would constitute a ground of: defence for a defendant charged, with taking the ship to seawith less than four-fifths of its complement. </para>

                <para>In proposed section 44, a similar provision is provided in relation to a ship going to sea with less than the number of seamen ordinarily carried. The extraordinary part about this provision is that it does not appear to be written in as a matter of substantive law. It appears from my reading of the principal act and the amendment that no express provision is made for a master or a seaman to register such a protest; it is taken for granted that such a protest can be registered and that, having been registered, it will be deemed to be an adequate ground for a prosecution to be launched against a master. 1 have risen particularly to ask the Minister to explain to the committee the reason that actuated the Government in writing :.n sub-section (10.) (c) allowing a member of the crew to take such action which would constitute a ground for a master to be prosecuted for taking a ship to sea in those circumstances. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline>
                    also mentioned that aspect of the matter. I think it is germane to the whole determination in relation to the amendment, and I would be pleased if the Minister would inform the committee, before the amendment is put to the vote, of the reason that actuated the Government in writing in that provision.

(c) is designed to facilitate a sailing where there is a minor shortage of crew and everyone on board is prepared to sail. Such a circumstance does occur when a ship suddenly loses a member at night. One instance of when it occurs that I can think of is at Christmas time. Everyone is anxious to get home then. This provides, in a sense, a defence for a master who has so sailed without a certificate. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 listened very attentively this afternoon to a most learned debate on the clause before the committee, and 1 was rather intrigued by the attitude of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition indicated by his statements that honorable senators on the other side recognized the right of a master to take his ship to sea with a certain percentage of the crew, as provided in proposed section 43, but they are opposed to the retention of the relevant sub-sections to give the master or the owner of a ship that authority. I feel that where a master or a shipping company has made every effort to get a full crew, there should be some way by which they can obtain authority for the ship to put to sea with a lesser number of crew. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>On the one hand, the sub-sections to which the Opposition objects give authority for that purpose. The Opposition is relying on sub-section (10.) and the defence aspect. In one instance a master can leave by authority with less crew, and in the other he takes a risk by going with a lesser number of crew. In these circumstances, he may be brought before a court to state his case and to prove that it was right for him to take the ship to sea. This is how the matter appears to me as a layman. </para>
                <para>I feel that it is not right that the legislation should not provide for some authority. We know that industrial courts can enforce certain things where authority exists, but under sub-section (10.) there is no authority. I doubt whether any industrial court would back up an order saying that a ship should have gone to sea with a lesser number of crew when it actually went to sea at the direction of the captain who considered that it was right for him to go. Sub-section (10.) (c) indicates very clearly that we have in mind the things that do happen in regard to ships. It opens up a very easy prospect for a member of the crew, for some reason or other that is of no great consequence, to thwart the desire of the master to take the ship to sea and carry on the trade that has been arranged. We know that these things do happen. Instances have occurred on the Australian coast which clearly show that, if the sub-sections to which the Opposition objects were omitted, sub-section (10.) (c) could be very troublesome. </para>
                <para>The Government should make this legislation as effective as possible for the proper, economical conduct of our seaborne trade. Anything which hinders the attainment of that, objective will detrimentally affect the conditions of everybody in this country. These matters may be far removed from many people who do not live on the seaboard to whom shipping has not the same application as to those closer to it. But the cost of transportation affects everybody in this country, and I believe that the purpose of the legislation should be to ensure that our maritime service has every power under the legislation to keep the ships moving continuously for the benefit of the trade and economic progress of Australia. </para>
                <para>I, therefore, support the retention in the bill of the provisions to which the Opposition objects because, to my mind, they constitute the only way in which a shipowner or master may obtain the authority he requires in such an instance. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was under the impression we had debated this matter adequately before the suspension for dinner. The amendment before the committee is to omit sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.). The debate necessarily has ranged outside the scope of those particular subsections, but I shall occupy a moment in restating the views of the Opposition. There is, and should be, a prohibition that a ship shall not put to sea unless it carries the full complement of crew prescribed by law. We heartily approve that prohibition, and do not want to see it cut down, in the terms of sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.), by enabling an officer,  a  proper authority, who might eventually be some obscure Commonwealth official in some remote port- </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite cannot deny that that situation could arise, may be in an extreme case, but it is possible. We object to any official, whether within or without Australia, being able to break down the complement set by law. If the complement is too high, let us cut it down to the minimum requirement for safety and comfort, but do not let us have a false complement and this system of consent which is a completely wrong system. </para>

                <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> that we want to keep the ships moving without hindrance, but this whole principle is based in antiquity upon a practice that has grown up in the mercantile marine of providing a margin of one-fifth of the crew. </para>
                <para>The whole situation would be much more definite if we set a clean complement from which no departure may be made. Should the master of a ship, in what he regards to be an emergency, be compelled to put to sea, he must be prepared to affirm that he did not have less than four-fifths of the crew and that no officer or member of the crew objected to the action he took. That is a completely clean, fair, safe and logical proposition. </para>
                <para>If honorable senators refer to sub-section (8.), which the Opposition seeks to omit, they will see the different treatment accorded to officers from that accorded to members of the crew. If a ship carries a number of officers below the complement, the authority, who may consent to the ship putting to sea in those circumstances, must be satisfied that the officers who will be carried on the ship are able to perform all the duties of the duly certificated officers who, but for the consent of the authority, would be required to man the ship. In short, where the full complement of officers is not carried, the proper authority may not give consent to the ship putting to sea unless he is satisfied that those on board can carry out the work of the absent officers. However, in the case of a deficiency in the complement of the crew, no such obligation rests upon the proper authority. </para>
                <para>That is the first very grave defect in the section. The second grave defect arises out of the point referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne.</inline> It is extraordinary that in subsection (10.) (c) the right of veto is given to any member of the crew but is denied in the case of a consent that may be granted by an officer. That is completely illogical and it appears to me that the Government is blowing hot and cold in the matter. </para>

                        <para>-  I did not say in the case of a consent of an officer. I am referring to the crew and dealing with the provisions of sub-section (8.) which the Opposition is seeking to omit. The consent of an officer is referred to in section 14a. (c) in another context where a complement higher than that prescribed is ordinarily carried. In that case consent is required. I shall advert to that later for another purpose. At the moment I am stating the defects inherent in sub-section (8.) which the Opposition seeks to omit. </para>

                <para>I am pointing to two extraordinary matters. If the complement of officers is below that prescribed, the consenting authority has to be satisfied that those who man the ship are able to perform the work of the total complement, but no such requirement exists in the case of the crew. That is a plain defect. I repeat that the Minister affirms the principle that the ship shall not put to sea with less than the prescribed complement without the consent of every member of the crew. I mention those two matters as additional reasons why the Opposition is opposing the section, and I feel I have again made our position clear. </para>

                    <para>.- I join issue with the Leader of the Opposition when he states that some obscure official in some remote port may be the proper authority. I can understand people thinking that that position could arise, but we are a responsible Government and no doubt responsible officers are stationed at the various ports. As an illustration, I refer to the Queensland Harbourmaster Service which performs a number of duties including the oversight of the safety of ships leaving port, small passenger craft and so on. I know from experience that the service does such a good job that one very rarely hears of an accident occurring in its line of operations. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>If members of that service, because they are responsible men chosen for the job, can do the work of overseeing the safety of people travelling in passenger craft, surely this Government will ensure that responsible persons will be chosen to implement this act. No officer would be so irresponsible as to allow a ship to put to sea without a necessary complement aboard; in fact the decision of such an officer would, no doubt, be on the cautious side. </para>
                <para>The same principle applies in civil aviation where certain safety restrictions are imposed and policed by the Civil Aviation </para>
                <para class="block">Department. In that case also we must rely on the human element and the respon  sibility  of human beings in their respective jobs. </para>

                    in his fear, is overestimating the dangers. I have more faith in the service and the officers chosen to carry out that particular duty, and I cannot imagine a  deputy  director or a proper authority who would make a decision that would involve a risk. I have sufficient faith in thetraining of those officers to say that we have nothing to worry about.

                    <para>. -  I regret that I must rise again to speak on this particular section, but, in my view, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> is labouring under a "misapprehension as to What constitutes a proper authority. The powerof consent that wearenow considering is vested in a  deputy  director or a proper authority. A  deputy  director would be an official in Australia, and I share the honorable senator's confidence in officials in thedepartment, but I invite him to referto the definition of " proper authority " as contained in the bill. It certainly covers the officials in whom he and I have confidence, but outside Australia, at a port in a Commonwealth country, it means a person who, under the law of that country, has duties similar to those of our own officers. Again, I might have considerable confidence in officers of other Commonwealth countries. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We come to sub-section (10.) (c) where, in relation to a port in a country other than a Commonwealth country - that is one outside the British Commonwealth countries - the officer who willmake the determination whether a ship can goto sea without its complement will be a diplomatic or consular representative of Australia, or a consul of any otherCommonwealth country.It could be the consul of any country at all. If the honorable senator knows anything of consuls he will know that there are consuls and consuls. It could come about that a very minor, inexperienced man with no knowledge of the sea or the maritime service in a port outside Empire countries, will determine whether a ship goes to sea without its proper complement. He is not tied up with the condition imposed in relation toofficers, that he hasto be satisfied that those who are left will be able to work the ship adequately.

                <para class="block">In short, the effect of that proposal is that a deputydirector or proper authority is not to give consent in either of two events. The first is the one that I now propose, namely, ifan officer or other member of the crew of the ship objects to its going to sea. The other is the one recorded in the provision,thatis,iftheeffectofsodoing would be to reduce the staff to lower than four-fifthsofthecomplement. </para>
                <para>A moment ago, in another context, I directed an argument to this point by comparison between sub-section (10.) and subsection (8.). I addressed an argument to the committee in relation to the difference that applied to the power of a member of the crew to voice an objection when consent is given by a proper authority or a  deputy  director and the position that exists when a master elects to go. </para>
                <para>I think I can sum it up for the committee by saying that if the master takes the ship to sea without the full complement, and without the official consent of the proper authority, or. a  deputy  director, he commits an offence punishable, on conviction, if, amongst other things, even one officer or one member of the crew has objected to the ship .sailing. In other words, sub-section (10.) provides an absolute right of veto to any one officer, or member of the crew. Now let us look at that in relation to the consent that may be given to a master pursuant to sub-section (8.), the sub-section that I hope will be amended. In that case, if the proper authority consents, the master may 'take the ship to sea with less than the prescribed complement, even if the whole crew objects. It seems extraordinary that the Minister should concede the principle of veto in one case and not in the other. There may, of course, be very sound reasons for conceding it where safety is concerned, for there, surely, the rights of individuals must be considered. If the complement fixed by law is not adhered to those who must take the consequent risk should have some say in the matter. That is the principle underlying the provision of a veto in subsection (10.). I merely want that principle applied to sub-section (8.) also. I do not wish to labour the argument further, because I have had an earlier opportunity of addressing myself to this matter. </para>

                    <para>. -  The first alternative amendment put by the Opposition had, I would suggest, a little merit. It proposed amongst other things, the deletion of the whole of subsection (8.). That would have given the master of a ship the right to take his ship to sea without a full complement, in certain circumstances. The master had the benefit of a saving provision - sub-section (10.). However slight, it gave him at least a semblance of a defence. </para>

                        <para>-  What is the good  of  having a deputy director skilled in making the decisions; what is the good of having  a  master skilled in taking ships to sea, if  we  are going to delegate to individual members of the crew the right to decide whether or not a ship will go to sea? That is the fundamental argument which the Opposition must face. Honorable senators opposite are asking the Senate to give crew members the right to act capriciously in these matters, while not providing a right of appeal against such an action. Only the very extreme members of the seamen's union who wish, for their own reasons, to control the industry, and the members of the Opposition, seek this provision. I do not think any other responsible person in Australia would regard it as reasonable. </para>

                        <para>- That is so.  No  such right is given to members of industries that are, perhaps, more dangerous than seafaring. Such a proposition would not even be thought of, yet the Opposition asks that we give it to .the Communist-ridden seamen's union. If that happened it would be possible for these people to hold up ships indefinitely. If the Opposition is serious that is the sum-total of its aims and objectives in this matter. I do not, for a moment, believe that all members of the Opposition are really serious in putting forward this proposition, rather that the seamen's union has insisted on the amendment and that the Leader of the Opposition has moved it with very great reluctance. There is no merit - if one wants to argue merits - in the proposal. Sub-section (10.) is not objected to. It would give the master of a vessel a defenceif he were charged with improperly taking a ship to sea. Therefore, there is a strong inference that the Opposition agrees that a complement of four-fifths is safe in certain circumstances. Regretfully, I must conclude that this amendment is put for political reasons only, and I oppose it strongly. </para>

                    <para>. - I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> that I adverted to subsection (10.) (c) - the paragraph which gives to any officer or member of a crew a complete right of veto - a right to prevent a master, lacking a full complement, from going to sea without consent. In other words, I drew attention to a veto, not sought by the Opposition, but conferred by the Government. I am not contending for a new principle and noted with interest the care with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> avoided referring to that particular paragraph. In view of what I have pointed out, the smear that he bestowed indirectly upon the Opposition for venturing to suggest this amendment might, if it were justified, be directed also at the Government, which has accorded a complete right of veto two sub-sections further on in the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The only charitable view that one can take of the argument of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> is that he smoothly makes it out of naivete, but prompted by the knavery of those whose interests he represents here to-night. To put his argument in perspective, we should recall that, in the first place, we prescribe the proper complement of a ship going to sea and then, in provision that the committee has already affirmed, we say that that complement may be reduced, but not to less than four-fifths, if the  Deputy  Director of Navigation or the proper authority consents. That proper authority is required to ensure, before giving his consent, that certain efforts have been made to procure a full complement. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Having been defeated on that basis, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> now says, " The Government has retained the sensible provisions contained in proposed sub-sections (7.), (8.) and (9.) ". Realizing that we are dealing with a sinkable commodity - shipping - he is endeavouring a punch a hole below the waterline. He suggests that even the most disaffected  seaman  on board a ship shall be able, by his objection, to prevent the ship going to sea, despite the fact that the  Deputy  Director of Navigation has said that he consents to it going. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> supported by the whole of the Opposition, intends to vote for the right of, perhaps, a Communist seaman to, as it were, punch a hole in, and sink, the provisions that the committee has just affirmed. </para>
                <para>An interesting argument is forthcoming, based on the plank which he rescues from his shipwreck. He bases his argument on proposed sub-section  (10.).  He says that the Government itself has given an officer or a member of a ship's crew the right to lodge an objection in writing. That is so, but the provision will not prohibit a master from taking his ship to sea with four-fifths of its complement, if the  Deputy  Director of Navigation has consented. It gives an individual the right to object in a case where the master has taken his ship to sea with four-fifths of its complement, but without the consent of the  Deputy  Director of Navigation. That is a distinction which, despite the legal acumen of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> he has, in his arguments to this chamber, hitherto succeeded in obscuring. </para>

                <para>We have the situation that we say that, with the consent of the  Deputy  Director of Navigation, a master may take a ship to sea with four-fifths of its complement. The  deputy  director, before he gives his consent, must ensure that the master has made every effort to obtain a full complement. We then go on to say that if there are circumstances in which a master takes his ship to sea with four-fifths of its complement, without the consent of the  deputy  director, he shall not be liable to prosecution unless a member of the crew has objected to his action in writing. In a case where a crew has not the protection of the  deputy  director, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> will concede the justice of allowing one member to put in an effective objection. But the position now is that he wishes to elevate the right of that member - perhaps a disaffected Communist - to object, and to give him a right to override and, in effect, destroy the consent of the  deputy  director. I never thought that we would hear such rubbish in this chamber. </para>

In other words, the context is that the Deputy Director of Navigation is. not to give his consent for a ship to sail unless the engine-room staff is four-fifths strong and the staff that remains consists of not less than four-fifths of the deck complement of the ship. </para>
                    <para>In sub-section (12.) the term " deck complement " is defined. I can submit only one amendment at a time, but the whole purpose of the two amendments, which are bracketed in intent and purpose, is to ensure that if the deck complement of a crew is short, in the calculation of the four-fifths boys and apprentices shall be disregarded. </para>

                        (Queensland [8.55]. - Apprentices, particularly on the Australian coast, do exactly the same work at the beginning as does a deck boy. In addition, an apprentice is trained by one of the ship's officers in some of the rudimentary work of navigation, the handling of cargo, and that sort of thing. A boy can become an ordinary seaman after a year at sea, so if a boy went to sea as a deck boy at the age of sixteen or seventeen years, he would be promoted to the status of ordinary seaman at seventeen or eighteen years of age. The Opposition might find that, by making this amendment, we. would include an ordinary seaman with perhaps a month or two months' service in that capacity and exclude an apprentice who might have served three or four years doing exactly the same work. On the Australian coast, an apprentice works with the crew; he manhandles ropes, scrubs the decks, and does exactly the same as does the ordinary seaman. During the time I spent on sailing ships, I saw ships with 24 apprentices and four able seamen. But, of course, those days have gone. I suggest to

                        nit  is the complement referred to in -proposed section 43 (1.). It is the complement that is fixed for each ship,  il  suggest to the .committee .that the amendment makes  perfectly clear what is intended. It remains for me . to give the reasons that have actuated the Opposition in moving it. The committee decided previously that this clause should be discussed in conjunction with clause .12. The reason for -bracketing the two clauses is that clause 12 deals .with the position of officers and ^.clause 29 deals with the position of crew. A similar consideration obtains in respect of both categories.
                    </para>
                    <para>The complement of officers is dealt with in two categories. With -regard to the prescribed complement, a proper authority may, as we have heard, consent to the ship leaving port without a full complement of officers, if certain conditions are fulfilled. -Those conditions are set out in sub-section (7:) of proposed section 14. Sub-section (8.) prohibits a proper authority from giving his consent unless he is satisfied that the officers shipped will -be able to carry out the duties of the complement officers who are not shipped. I concede that that appears to afford something like adequate protection. An appropriate authority has to he 'assured, .before he gives his consent, that those who go with the ship will be able to do the work of the full complement of officers. </para>
                    <para>But now we come to the proposed section '14a. We are still dealing with officers, but we are concerned with a deficiency only when the extraordinary position arises that "the number ordinarily carried on 'the ship is greater than the prescribed complement - when the ship is proposing to go to sea, it may be with the prescribed complement, but -with less than the number ordinarily carried. In that situation, the ship can go to sea without the -number of officers ordinarily carried if, after objection raised in writing by an officer, an appropriate authority consents in writing. It simply amazes me to think that a ship can be taken -to sea with less than its prescribed complement, without consultation with the officers concerned. </para>

                            <para>- Subject to the consent of a proper authority, but where the number ordinarily carried is higher than the complement, an objection has to be lodged before consent is necessary. That strikes me as extraordinary, but that is exactly what- -the 'bill provides in paragraph (c) 'of sub-section (1.) of proposed section 14a. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in relation to crew, but I am leading to the point about objections that .can be lodged. That is the purpose of my amendment. I am still dealing with officers. I point out that, in such circumstances, the master is required to post up the consent on the ship once he has obtained it from the proper authority, and to keep it posted until the ship goes to sea. That is provided in sub-section d-)(e). </para>

                    <para>I suggest that a very serious defect in all these provisions is that there is no machinery to enable the officers to know, in sufficient time before sailing, that the numbers ordinarily carried are in fact not to be carried. There is a complete gap. I pose this question to the ^Minister: How does an officer become aware-that the ship is going to  sea1 without the ;M1 complement df -officers -.ordinarily  carried, -even though that complement is above the prescribed one? An exactly similar position arises, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has pointed out, in connexion with proposed sections 43 and 44. Those sections deal with crew, as distinct from officers. Again, there is an opportunity to object, reference to which is made in one of the clauses we have already discussed. I again ask: How will a member of the crew know that the ship is about to put to sea without the full complement, unless there is some machinery to enable him to be informed and to put him in a position to lodge an objection? </para>
                    <para>In other words, my proposition is simply this: What is the use of conceding a right to object if you do not give an opportunity for those concerned to find out the facts upon which to base the objection? That is the whole point involved in this matter. It seems to me that the only way in which the difficulty can be resolved is to put up, in a place where the crew can see it, the particulars of the complement that the ship should carry and, in appropriate circumstances, particulars of the higher numbers carried ordinarily, and then to record any deficiency. As the deficiency varies, the change can be recorded also. </para>

Surely, that should tell every member of the crew the complete story. </para>

                            <para>- If they know the contents of this act, they are far more knowledgeable than are most honorable senators. I think it is true to say that the crews change from ship to ship. They may need to make an inquiry from time to time to ascertain the complement. Such information should be readily available. I suggest that little effort would be needed to make it available. To do so would impose no hardship on the shipowner or the master. Would it constitute any hardship to a master to record, for everybody to see, what the deficiency was at a given time? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> may say that a copy of the agreement is posted. I know that that is so, but it is a pro forma agreement which does not contain the story about the ship's complement of officers and crew. I think that there is a reference to the number of ordinary and able-bodied seamen who are carried, in one of the opening clauses of a very complicated agreement. All that the Opposition is asking is that there be recorded, in a place readily accessible, first, information as to the complement of the ship in respect of officers and crew, and secondly, particulars of any deficiency that may occur from time to time. That will put the crew and the officers in a position to lodge the objections that they have the right to lodge under the act. In the absence of such things, the facts upon which they are entitled to object may never come to their notice. </para>

                    <para>If honorable senators will refer to the terms of the amendment I have moved, they will see that it simply provides that the master shall keep posted up from time to time particulars of the prescribed complement of officers and crew and of the crew ordinarily carried in excess of that complement, and if there is any deficiency to have that fact recorded and to keep the information up to date. That is no major burden upon anybody. I am informed that it would be a great convenience to those who were concerned about the complements with which ships go to sea. </para>

In answer to something that the Leader of the Opposition said, I point out that a ship would never leave the port of engagement without a full crew. I assure the honorable senator that the various shipping unions - the seafaring unions - would make quite sure when the crew was being engaged that the full complement was engaged. That need not apply to the officers of the ship because in many cases owners have found it more economical to carry one, two, or sometimes three more officers than is necessary under the manning scale in the schedule. </para>
                    </talk.start></interjection><para>For example, ships of from 150 to 1,000 tons need carry only a first and a second mate, but invariably they carry three mates, chiefly because it is more economical to do so. If they carried only two mates, it would mean that each of them would be getting four hours overtime a day for double watches, and also it would affect the amount of payment in respect of their home port days for which they would have to be paid, because if there were only two officers they would have to be on duty night and night about or both would be on duty while working cargo in port. I can assure the committee that if one officer happened to be missing, the other officers of the ship would be in a position to know that he was missing long before the captain had to put up a notice that he was missing and that he was going to sail without that person. </para><continue>

                            <para>-  Foreign-going, not foreign ships. This does not apply to foreign ships. We have nothing to do with foreign ships in our manning scales. As to a member of the crew being missing and the rest of the crew not having an opportunity of knowing he was missing unless the fact was posted up and cited by the captain, I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that, on the Australian coast, if a man is missing the rest of the crew will not sail until they find out where he is or why he has gone ashore. They do not have to wait for the captain to put something up in writing to the effect that he has gone off, in order to know about his absence. I can quote an example of that - a frivolous example. Many of these things are frivolous. One of the reasons why the Minister is bringing down these regulations is to try to stop the frivolity that is occasioned by bad leadership of the union. I shall mention a certain case that occurred last year when I went away for seven weeks on a Patrick ship just to see what went on. </para>

                    </interjection><para>Five minutes before sailing time in Melbourne, an A.B. came along and said to the chief officer, " I am going ashore to ring up ". The chief officer said, " You cannot do that. We are about to take down the gangway and leave." Nevertheless, the seaman went ashore and along to the telephone. It was an hour and three-quarters before he came back. We expected him back every minute and the captain did not leave the ship, take a taxi and go up town to the shipping office to try to get authority to sail without him. For the whole of that period the port of Melbourne was held up, as any one who knows Melbourne can understand. There were two tugs standing by in the narrow stretch of water down from Victoria dock; no other ship could come up the river during that time, simply because a seaman had gone ashore with a frivolous excuse. If the master of a &lt; ship could get authority quickly to sail one short of the complement, I think- it would, be a bit of a lesson to those who engage in this sort of frivolity. </para><para>Members, of the Opposition have been talking- about: the. great Australian merchant service, and they ask the Minister at question time how many ships are being built in Australia, and so on. Before the war, the Australian coastal trade was recognized as the greatest coastal trade in the world. If we are going to accede to all the demands that the. seamen's union is insisting! on to-day; that trade will disappear: Already, half a dozen big passenger ships have disappeared from the coast  and they will not- be replaced; the shipping' companies just cannot afford to replace1 them. As honorable senators know, I am no barracker for' the shipping companies, but I know that they cannot- afford to go on when alf these troubles occur between the seamen and the waterside workers - troubles which are going to ruin the whole of the coastal shipping trade. The two points that I rose specifically to make were that the crew would be well aware if one of their number was missing and, secondly, it would be quite obvious if a ship's officer was missing. </para></speech>

Although I am not a master mariner oran able: seaman, I- appreciate the real difficulties that he suggests-. One does not need to- be- an experienced seaman to realize- how hopeless the-- task would be if this amendment were- accepted. I can imagine- the dilemma1 of a master of a ship if, a quarter1 of an' hour before- sailing: time-, he foundthat he was short of one man who. had gone ashore to ring up and had. not returned. He would be faced with this question: Does the man's- name go on the board, or should h&amp; be given another hour's grace before his name was' put on the board, in terms of the Opposition's amendment? </para>

                    <para>I feel that there are some practical difficulties" in the matter, but there are far more important reasons why this amendment should not be accepted. The more' important is- the matter of legal responsibility. I think the weakness in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator M'cKenna's'</inline> amendment is that the master of - a' ship, is? not: responsible to the. crew for the carrying: out of the provisions of - this:, act; he is-, responsible, indirectly, to' the'Minister; audi certainly to. the. department; They are the ones who are: entitled to see. the prescribed complements, and all details in relation thereto, because it is. they who have to give consent, the crew or the officers do not give the consent. I do not. see that one ought to impose an additional burden upon the master of a vessel to be responsible . in some respects to his crew for carrying out a statutory obligation when, in fact, there is no legal ' responsibility attaching to the master to be responsible to the crew in any respect at alf.' That responsibility is to the department. Sub-section (8.) makes it clear that the-  Deputy  Director has that statutory obligation through the master-to ensure that the ship.'cannot go to sea. without' the prescribed complement or, if1 the prescribed' complement is- not present,- then with a sufficient number of officers so as- to ensurethat all duties shall1 be adequately carried out. Sub-section (8.) makes that abundantly clear. Why, then, should the- master be saddled, with the; additional burden of being answerable to the crew? If there, were somer legal obligation to. the crew, I. would say that responsibility rested on the- master toshow his list to the crew, but no such legal, obligation rests on the master. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna-'s</inline> request is outside the reason, able degree of responsibility that should ber accepted, by this legislation. </para>
                    <para>The proposed section is more- than fair to. the crew because it imposes upon- the master' the. obligation of placing on the notice* board a- consent as soon- as it has1 been obtained,, and-' even sub-normal members of the crew would then be informed, first, that a deficiency' existed in the- prescribed, complement, secondly, that an application for a permit had been made, and thirdly, that consent had been given by the proper authority. What more could any member of the crew reasonably expect, in view- of the. fact that the master has: no actual responsibility to the crew to account for such details? </para>

                        <para>. -  I am disappointed that the Minister has not- indicated a view in the matter. Although I was interested in the remarks of his colleagues, I should like to know whether the Minister accepts or rejects the proposal. We learned from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall,</inline> who. has had. practical experience in this sphere, that no grave harm will be done by, although he does not see very much merit ja, the amendment. In those circumstances, if the Minister shares that view he might well' accept the proposal of the Opposition, unless he has. some other reason to advance. </para>

                        in his recent contribution to the debate claimed that the master has no responsibility to the crew, but he overlooked the fact that the master is prohibited from taking a ship to sea unless it carries a full complement. A legal obligation is upon the master, not only at large but also* in its particular application to the members of the crew, to ensure that they are buttressed by adequate numbers, in taking a ship to sea. In those circumstances, what can be the objection to the slight amount of effort that the amendment proposes to impose upon the master? In any case, the additional work of posting in a prominent position the ship's complement would, no doubt, be done by one of the officers of the ship. Those occasions, on which a deficiency in the complement existed would, no doubt,, be reasonably rare. I do not seen any burden imposed on the master, but I can envisage some good from the proposal.

The number of officers required to be carried is. well known on any ship, and it is quite fantastic for any honest attempt to be made to create the impression that the officers and-crew of a ship on the Australian coast1 are not fully aware of the number of officers to be carried, on any vessel. The. crew of the ship is also well known; indeed, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has acknowledged, the articles of the ship containing the complement of th*e vessel are exhibited in. a prominent place, usually, I understand, in the recreation room of the vessel. Anything, further required of the master would be. merely an unnecessary aggravation. </para>

                        has said that theauthority to sail must be displayed. Some concern has been expressed that crew members may not' have the opportunity- to' protest but what is- the -sequence of events of a.j master- coming into - possession of an authority? First, he must obtain the certificate,

                        proper authority, who does nod issue, the permit until he has satisfied himself that the master-has made all reasonable attempts to fill- the complement of thecrew and has, in fact, approached the unionto. that end. All those things combined eliminate, the necessity for this amendment which', in practical terms, is an unnecessary aggravation and another job imposed on a master already hindered by over-much paper work.

I propose that at that point, after the word " Australia " the words contained in my amendment be inserted.

It is bracketed with the amendment before the Chair and I think that if I refer to it now we may save time later. It will be noticed that in dealing with foreign-going ships, whether British or Australian, the proviso says that the regulations shall not allow the employment on such ships of the crew in handling cargo or ballast where a sufficiency of shore labour is available. I think that the same proviso should be attached to subsection (2.) of the act which related to Australian coastal ships. Sub-section (2.) says - </para>

                    <para class="block">I think it is probably merely through oversight that this proviso attached to subsection ( 1 .) dealing with foreign-going ships is not similarly attached to sub-section (2.) which deals with ships engaged in the coastal trade. In my view, the same proviso should apply to both. At the moment, I am not moving the amendment relating to sub-section (2.); I merely indicate it. It may not be necessary for me to move it, or to argue it further in view of what I have said. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think that the amendment proposed by the Government is good and that the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> on behalf of the Opposition, should be rejected. I have listened all day to honorable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> of course, being prominent amongst them, probably briefed, as they are entitled to be, by the seamen's union on these matters. 1 feel that the practical eflect of most of the amendments suggested by the Opposition would be to grind to a halt the Australian shipping service. The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> could go even further. I suggest that it could fold up a good deal of our own internal trade and assist to fold up a good deal of the foreign export trade which, we hope, will be carried by foreign-going ships registered in Australia to those countries near to us. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If this amendment is carried, I doubt whether there will be many shipowners who will want to register their ships in Australian ports; if they can register them in other ports, they will do so because of the effect the amendment would have if it were carried. We hope that there will be an increased movement of shipping between Australia and the vast territory of Antarctica, and I suggest that there will be a dispute over the question whether there is sufficient labour down there to unload a ship. Consider the effect of the amendment, which seeks to add the words " and in the case of a foreign-going ship registered in Australia shall not be employed at a port outside Australia." I ask honorable senator's to consider what might happen in Australian Territories such as Nauru, Norfolk Island and Cocos Island - all of strategic importance. There might be a prescribed let-out, but its application would involve work by more and more civil servants. As the law stands, a crew can be called upon to undertake necessary work of that kind. The proposal of the Opposition would, if accepted, assist our merchant service to grind to a halt and hamper development in Australian territories. Consequently, I cannot support the amendment. The proposal by the Government that this principle should operate in Australia only is, I think, very sound. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should like to reply briefly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught's</inline> comment on the amendment. He is apparently afraid that our shipping services would grind to a halt, but his alarm is quite unfounded because section 45 (1.), which has been in existence since 1921 at least, places a complete prohibition upon British and foreign ships using their crews to load or unload cargo and ballast anywhere in the world. </para>

                            <para>- It has stood, in the widest possible terms, since 1921. It was, I concede, beyond power. That kind of thing has been, to a limited extent, within power in relation to British ships since 1942, when the Statute of Westminster began to operate. For sixteen years, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught,</inline> the shipping service of Australia should have been grinding to a halt because of a prohibition such as the Opposition now suggests. </para>

                            <para>- One would have to consider the facts in each case. It may be completely beyond our jurisdiction, but that would depend on whether the vessel was owned by a British national or a foreign national, and so on. I cannot answer the honorable senator's question without knowing facts of that kind. What is wrong with saying that the crews of ships under Australian control shall not load or unload cargo, but may be required by regulation to do so where there is an insufficiency of shore labour? I am not recommending the alteration of the wide power already existing in the act. </para>

                    <para>So far as the Antarctic, Cocos Island and Other remote parts of the world are concerned, it is perfectly clear that the regulations would not merely permit, but would authorize .and require, crews to load and unload where there was an obvious insufficiency of shore labour. I cannot understand why every Government supporter looks for something sinister in almost every amendment put forward by the Opposition. We merely ask that Australian crews should sail ships and not engage in stevedoring operations. The Government has laid that down already so far as Australia is concerned. We merely ask that it should go a little further and prohibit such operations outside of Australia if sufficient shore labour is available. Let us suppose that an Australian ship with an Australian crew went to a foreign port and, despite adequate shore labour, proceeded to load and unload cargo and ballast. Would that help our relations with the country concerned? </para>

The regulations would specify the circumstances in which the crew could be used. Surely the issue is very simple. The Government says, " The existing provision is far too wide - it purports to govern all the ships, even. those outside Australia. Let us bring it back into line and confine its operation to Australian ports." We say, "Take the matter a step further and apply it to Australian crews of ships registered in Australia, when they are .abroad. Prohibit their use as stevedores when adequate shore labour is available." </para>

                            <para>- A foreign law might permit the crew to act or, on the other hand, require it so to do. The honorable senator must note the difference there. We do not attempt to legislate for or against such a position, but -merely ask that Australian crews not engage in stevedoring operations where sufficient shore labour is available. We cannot prevent any local law from overriding our law. A foreign country would have the bodies and could legislate in furtherance of 'its own powers. There is nothing exceptionable in "the amendment and the committee should support it. </para>

It possibly did not have an extra-territorial application, but in the eyes of the world we were laying down for application in other countries a principle which , we were applying in our own country. I do not think it is a good thing to apply in this country a principle of industrial justice as between men who work on the. shore and men who work on the ships and then, by express provision, deny it to other countries to which Australian ships may go. I think that the principle involved is a good principle. If we are going to apply it, it should be applied not only to our own ships here, but also, as far as possible, to our own ships trading in other ports. For those reasons I will support the amendment. I think it is fair and just. </para>

A breach, notofacivil law, but of the industrial customsofanother country couldbring., our ships . and. our country into great disrepute. The actionof this Parliament could be. pointed to, . and. it could. be. said that we had excluded the possibility of such a conflictin our own  ports, hut had opened the. door to it in the ports of other countries at which Australian ships call.

                        <para>. - The Opposition's amendment ignores the operation of any foreign law thatwould becontrary to it. Ifa French law obligeda ship's crew to be usedfor the purpose of unloading the ship, the Australian law - as I think even SenatorMcKenna will agree- would be overridden by the French law. Therefore, we arediscussing a proposal subject in all respects to the provisions of the local laws that apply from time to time and from place to place. I think one must accept that proposition- as a prerequisite to a discussion, of this proposed amendment. Therefore, theproposed amendment would apply only in; cases-- where a local law permitted  a  ship's crew to be so used. </para>

I am surprised at anybody in the Senate advocating that the gentlemen in the bum boats of Port Said should have the exclusive right to earn an honest penny by unloading ships in Port Said and denying to our own seamen the right to earn a few bob in that way. That is what our friends of the Opposition are suggesting. Do they really think that that is social justice for our seamen? Are our seamen in agreement with them? I am surprised that people who purport to represent trade unions and who say that they have the interests of the workers at heart are now, in effect, denying to our seamen the right to earn something extra. </para>

The members of the seamen's union should be pleased that I am advocating that they should be entitled to earn a little more. All that they could do at Port Said would be to sit down and fish - and there are not many fish in the harbour there. They should be given the right to earn an honest extra penny, if they desire to do so. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has just made an extraordinary contribution to the debate. I am sure that it is not the desire of Australian seamen, working under the seamen's, award and enjoying the full protection of that award, to be used to load or unload ships in foreign ports. If stevedoring labour is available in foreign ports, it should be utilized, for the sake of promoting harmony in the ports to which we send our ships. For that reason I believe that this amendment is sound and solid. It is laughable from our point of view to say that it is a good principle that men should be able to earn a few extra shillings in this way in a foreign port. If we agreed to that, we would also, to be logical, have to agree that the crews of foreign ships which come to this country should be allowed to load or unload their ships here. The master of a Chinese ship calling here might say, " We do not want your wharf lumpers. We shall do the work ourselves ". Would honorable senators opposite argue that our men should stand down, but that that would not matter because they were being paid for waiting, time? Would they say, " Let these other people earn an honest penny "? </para>

                        <para>.- I should like the Minister to consider some aspects of sub-sections (1a.) and (1b.) of section 45. I ask him to consider whether it is intended by sub-section (1a.)  -  a pro-  vision in an act which can only have effect, in relation to interstate shipping - to apply to an intra-state vessel rates of wages which a Commonwealth award has made applicable to interstate vessels. If that is not the purpose, I do not know why the section' does not leave to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the provision., that is there made. </para>

                    <para>I pass on to section 45 (1b.) of the act. If we are to extend the operation of thiskind of restrictive Australian law to foreign ports, I ask the Minister to note that section 45 (1a.) is limited to any port in Australia and that sub-section (1b.) although <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> think intended to be so restricted, is not' restricted. If the expositions that have induced the Minister to agree to a postponement of this amendment are to be relied on, section 45 (1b.) would have world-wide operation, lt would mean that in ports outside Australia we would be saying that shore labour was not available unless it was available at rates prescribed by Australian industrial awards. The whole thing is a theoretical fiasco being discussed in the vacuum of this chamber against a background of what is happening on the Mel-  bourne waterfront. I suggest that we should get a little more reality into our consideration of the whole problem. </para>

                    <para>That has clear application only to trade on the coast of Australia. The regulations are authorized to forbid the employment of... members of the crews in question except as £ prescribed. The regulations are given wide scope, and I suggest that they should be conditioned and confined in relation to the coastal trade in the same way as they are in section 45 (1.), which has application to foreign-trade ships whether Australian registered or not. There, the regulations are not to allow the employment of the crew of such ship in handling cargo or ballast where a sufficiency of shore labour is available. I think it is appropriate that, above all else, the regulations should not be able to authorize a crew to load or unload when there is a sufficiency of labour on the Australian waterfront. I do not think it is necessary to say anything further. I commend the amendment to the committee. </para>

                        <para>.-Clause 31 of the bill does not purport to rewrite section 45a of the act but seeks to make a number of amendments to the various sub-sections. Section 45a deals with the engagement of seamen and, in particular, with the character of seamen and their disentitlement to be engaged after a series of bad discharges. The viewpoint advanced by the Opposition is that these provisions are completely outmoded and are unfairin certain grave particulars. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The effect of the three amendments that I propose tomove is toleave out the sections that disentitle a man : to engagement after a number of bad discharges. For every Offence that he can commit there is prescribed a heavy penalty. Some of the penalties involve imprisonment. All of them involve fines. Surely, in respect of Offence after offence, it issufficient for a man to be gaoled or fined, without addi tion to his punishment, after three bad discharges, of the penalty of disentitlement to engagement! I think that that is unnecessarily vicious, particularly when one remembers that a master has the right to say, in any event, when a man is offered to him, " I do not want that man; I want another ". Is that not so? </para>

                            <para>-  I am happy to hear the honorable senator concede that there is a choice and that it is not necessary for the authority concerned to take each man who offers. He can exercise a discretion, having regard to the history and the character of the individuals concerned. If that is the case, why should we, in addition to providing for fines and gaol sentences for various offences, also provide for disentitlement to employment? I should like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> on the proposition that has been submitted to me, that a man may accumulate three bad discharges, and that within a period of five years, as the act requires, he may become liable to be rejected by a superintendent for employment on the seafront. But if he is accepted, as many such seamen are, he may acquire a very good discharge. He may reform. Despite that fact, he still is liable to be rejected and disqualified from engaging in employment on the seafront. </para>

                        <para>. - I indicate quite briefly that the amendments proposed by the Leader of the Opposition are not acceptable to the Government. That will come as no surprise to any one in this chamber who remembers the background of their introduction, and who recalls the debate that took place at the time they were introduced. But in signifying that the Government does not propose to accept the amendments, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> and to the Senate generally, that in reaching that conclusion the Government has not shrunk from having a look at section 45A and from introducing such amendments as it has considered desirable. Indeed, if one looks at sub-section (4.), it is obvious that a big alteration has been made which could operate in favour of a seaman who, in some circumstances, may have been harshly treated. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Sub-section (4.) requires the master of a ship to report to a superintendent a seaman who deserts a ship or who, without reasonable cause, leaves or fails to join a ship, to go to sea in a ship or to take a ship to sea. The following sub-section provides that such a report from a master shall be deemed to be a bad report equal in effect to a report made at the time of a seaman's discharge. In the new provision, no change is proposed in regard to men who desert or fail to join. Those offences will continue to count as part of the three bad reports needed to exclude a man from the industry. However, a man who, after refusing to sail, remains on board his ship, is in a different category. Being still a member of the crew, he is subject to discipline and can be dealt with in several different ways, including dismissal without a bad report. It is felt to be anomalous that this man could be in the position of having two bad reports recorded against him for the same offence, the first for his refusal to sail, and the second that which he may receive under section 67 at the end of his service. </para>
                    <para>Cases have also occurred of men being reported for having refused to sail. The dispute has been settled and the men have ended their service with very good discharges. Nevertheless, although subsequent good service has cancelled out their action during the dispute, the original bad report remains. It is proposed to rectify these anomalies by omitting from subsection (4.) the words " to go to sea in that ship or to take that ship to sea," thus leaving the seaman who refuses to sail liable only to disciplinary action, in the same manner as any other seaman who commits a breach of discipline. </para>
                    <para>I am sure that the Opposition will appreciate that that is a considerable concession and indicates quite clearly that the Government has given consideration to this clause. In stating that we regard it as essential as a disciplinary measure to retain it, I point out to the Opposition that we have not done so without giving full consideration to the whole matter. </para>

                        <para>. - Would the Minister be disposed to consider the suggestion that I made, that three bad discharges followed by a good one, in specified circumstances, should result in the good discharge cancelling out one of the bad ones?Would not that be an improvement and afford encouragement and incentive to a man to give better service? I think that the Minister could well address his mind to that suggestion. I ask him whether any consideration has been given to it and, if not, whether the Government would be prepared to entertain some such ameliorating provisions. The Minister has been good enough to indicate his attitude, that he is not open to persuasion on the general repeal of these three sub-sections. To save time, I suggest that my three amendments be considered together. We could then vote on them and dispose of the three of them together. If there is any technical difficulty about that being done, we shall have to take them one by one; but since the committee is prepared to accede to my request, they will be taken together. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government would not consider meeting the request of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to one good discharge cancelling out a bad discharge. I point out to him that the committee of advice which sits and which advises the Minister frequently does indicate that certain action should be taken - that men should be taken back into the industry on a one-chance basis - in certain instances. That committee of advice consists, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, of members of both sides of the industry - employers and employees. That, I believe, is ample to meet the particular position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has put to me. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to state my understanding of the Opposition's proposal. If I understand it aright, I want to express the opinion that it is an enormous bid to establish complete lawlessness with regard to the engagement of labour. The two sub-sections which the Leader of the Opposition is interested in removing merely say that the engagement of a seaman is subject to the approval of a superintendent, but the superintendent is required not to refuse approval except in accordance with the act. The two sub-sections that the Leader of the Opposition objects to follow. They simply say that the superintendent may, in certain circumstances, refuse to approve the engagement of the seaman. They do not require the superintendent to refuse; they do not make it obligatory for him to do so. But these provisions are sufficient to excite the interest of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to see that the superintendent has not a remnant of authority to refuse approval for the re-engagement of a seaman whose conduct and character have in three or more reports within a period of five years immediately preceding the date upon which he applies for engagement been shown as bad. It is only in the case where approval is sought for the engagement within six months after the third of those bad discharges that sub-section (2.) tamely and meekly authorizes the superintendent to refuse approval. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> having listened to that objection, 1 just wonder to what limits the impudence of the seamen's union will next time extend! </para>
                    <para>Another provision that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> seeks to exorcize is sub-section (3.), which simply says that where the period between the dates of the delivery of the last two reports - the last two bad discharges - exceeds two years and the seaman affected in the reports has served regularly during that period, the superintendent may approve the engagement. Every phrase in the subsection is facultative. Every phrase gives the superintendent authority enabling the seaman to get engagement. Yet that is one of the sub-sections that the Opposition seeks to remove from the measure! I am just amazed. I think the true intendment has not been understood by the Opposition, and that it has been instructed to do this by the seamen's union, under the influence of some mistake. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> as is usual when he is opposing something, has been over-extravagant in his language. I am referring to his comment that the Opposition is seeking to uphold complete lawlessness on the seafront. I reject that assertion entirely. It is obvious from the arguments I have already addressed to the committee that that was not contemplated. One of the arguments that I have advanced was that before a man acquires a bad discharge he has been guilty of offences. The offences that are set out in this act are many, in relation to both foreign seamen and our own seamen. The penalties imposed are exceedingly rigorous. </para>

                            <para>- I do agree, and T am not suggesting that it should not be increased. That, too, is a perversion of my argument. I am certainly upholding the right of law. I am pointing out that there are many sanctions and the Opposition is completely conscious of their recurrence when it seeks the removal of these particular sub-sections. </para>

                        claims that subsection (3.) is wholly beneficial. If he had been fair in presenting that argument and if his memory had been good, he would have remembered that I said that the repeal of sub-section (3.) was consequential upon the repeal of sub-section (2.) The latter is the provision that imposes the prohibition or the difficulty about the re-engagement of the men. If that were repealed, sub-section (3.) would be meaningless. Sub-section (3.) is beneficial only if sub-section (2.) remains in statu quo. My proposal was to get rid of sub-section (2.), and then sub-section (3.) would serve no purpose. The comment that emanated from
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>
                        on that matter was not fair. He concentrated on sub-section (3.) and disregarded the fact that it was purely subsequential upon subsection (2.), the penalty sub-section.

                    <para>On behalf of the Opposition, I make no apology for advancing a proposal for the removal of a relic of the sea. This system of bad discharges could well be overhauled and put on an entirely different and better basis. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that I said earlier that it was not obligatory on a master to engage any individual who offers; he may decline one man and pick the next. </para>

We cannot do it, but we can authorize people to do it. The seamen's union has no monopoly of the supply of labour to ships. This law allows the superintendent to attend to that matter. Of course no person can be forced to offer for engagement. All one can do is confer rights upon people to exercise certain power. </para>

                    <para class="block">The terms of that provision impose a complete prohibition upon the employment of a person who is not able to understand the English language sufficiently to enable him to carry out the necessary orders that may be given. That complete prohibition appears to have been broken down by the use of the word " may " in the proposed new subsection (9a) of section 45a. </para>
                    <para>Earlier in the debate I drew attention to the prohibition upon the engagement of a person who is not able to speak or understand the English language correctly. Surely the prohibition is designed to ensure that orders given to persons engaged on ships are not misunderstood. 1 can appreciate the results if a seaman were told to light a fire in the master's cabin and set the ship on fire because he did not understand that he should have pulled a switch., Orders given on board ship in case of. emergency must be obeyed and carried out immediately. </para>

(b) provides that an agreement of employment between the seamen and the master shall be prepared in duplicate by, or under the supervision of, a superintendent.

                    <para class="block">The amendment proposes that a copy of the agreement shall be given to the seaman. I do not intend to press those amendments at the moment. I shall not formally move them, but I should like to outline to the Minister the thoughts of the Opposition about these matters. As 1 have said, the proposal is that an agreement of employment will be prepared in duplicate, the superintendent retaining one copy and the master of the ship holding the other. A copy is not to be provided for the employee. 1 realize that on very large ships the requirements 1 have in mind would involve the preparation of a great number of agreements, but, even if a large number is involved, 1 do not see why the dignity of the individual should not be recorded properly in these transactions. What happens at the moment is that one great form, filled with a mass of detail, is signed by all members of the crew. Their pay is recorded in it. It is competent for one person to see what the other is getting. It seems to me to be a relic of other days when crews were press-ganged and when they were dealt with, not as a collection of individuals, but just as a body of men. I am proposing to the Minister that it would be a better approach to this industry if individual agreements were prepared in triplicate and a copy were made available to the seaman. </para>
                    <para>I have looked at the agreement. I know that it serves two purposes, one of which extends to the ship's complement and the other to ;the engagement of the particular  individual.  I think there is something wrong about herding all prospective employees together on the one document, as it were, and I do think that much of the matter printed in the agreement form that 1 see in the Minister's hand now, and which is of terrifying proportions, could be eliminated with advantage. </para>
                    <para>I should like to hear what is the objection to having a small agreement for each individual, prepared in triplicate. It would involve a few more signatures by the master, but what would be the objection to forgetting all about the whole scope of the provisions and devising a simple contract of employment, letting each individual have a copy for his own benefit? </para>

                        <para>. -  The form which the agreement referred to by the Leader of the Opposition takes is that of the document I now have in my hand. It is a big document. It is not an agreement as between the master and his seamen; it is an agreement signed by the master and it covers the whole of his complement. It is issued in duplicate. The superintendent holds one copy, and the master holds the other. The superintendent's copy is readily available to any seaman who wants to peruse it. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is rather more than that. After all, the superintendent is a man who is dealing with seamen day by day. That is his business. A seaman's business brings him into contact with the superintendent, and I think the sort of relationship that does exist makes it more than a mere matter of grace that the superintendent should make available to a crew member a copy of the agreement for his perusal. </para>

                    <para>I am advised by my officers that this request by the Opposition comes out of the blue. It is something of a surprise to us. One of my officers who has years of experience of service of this nature tells me that he cannot recall a single request by a seaman for a copy of the agreement. I suggest that a copy is available to a seaman if he wants to see it. As no such request has been made, as the preparation of individual agreements would entail a tremendous amount of work, and especially as it seems that most seamen would not want an agreement anyway, I believe that on practical grounds the amendment should be rejected. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like advice from the Minister as to whether it is a fact that the practice of sea-faring unions is to appoint a representative on board large ships where any great number of their members are employed, and whether this representative is usually selected by the union because of his knowledge of the agreement and is, therefore, always in a position to advise members of the union on matters in connexion with the agreement. I have always understood that a union appointed a representative who had knowledge of these matters and could advise the crew on them. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment, because it is hardly a practicable proposition. I am advised that the superintendent, in opening an original agreement, inspects the load-line certificate and assures himself that it is in order, but that when later agreements are signed the original inspection is deemed to have been sufficient. I understand that the certificate is kept on the ship and that if it were necessary to produce it at the opening of every agreement it would have to be taken out of its frame, transported to the office of the superintendent, offered for display, and then returned to its frame on the ship. For instance, it would be quite ridiculous to demand the load-line certificate of such a well known vessel as the " Orsova " every time a superintendent attested an agreement. </para>

I wonder, if the certificate is too big to produce readily, why something easier could not be devised. Could not a copy be left permanently with the superintendent? Is there any real need to record its production on the agreement? </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to direct attention to the tactics adopted by the members of certain industrial organizations when any one has the temerity to regard them as other than sacrosanct. Yesterday, in discussing a measure before the Senate, I had occasion to refer to recent events on the Hobart waterfront. I referred to intimidatory tactics by the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers Federation against a fellow unionist by the name of Colrain, who had refused to bend the knee to the Communist bosses of his union. I also referred to a letter which I had previously received from certain seamen's union delegates on " Tarwinna ", threatening a national strike unless the Government withdrew the Australian National Line from pending industrial legislation. In keeping with this policy of intimidation, which seems so blatant in maritime matters, this afternoon I received a telegram from the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. The telegram was addressed to me at Parliament House, Canberra, and it reads as follows:- </para>

                        <para>This job meeting of waterside workers and seamen working SS Warringa, Hobart, condemns your statement as published. Such utterances can only be made by people who are ignorant of facts or made by one who believes in and could be a member of the thuggery class. Your statement is abuse of parliamentary privileges. In the interests of this country and the trade union movement no alteration to navigation act. Hands off the maritime unions. Public meeting held Queen's Domain, </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe it is proper that people with  a  direct interest in legislation should have the right to place their views before their parliamentary representatives in reasoned terms. However, I think that that telegram comes close to a breach of parliamentary privilege. I take umbrage at being told by the strong-arm men, of all people, that I believe in and could be a member of the thuggery class. The other references in the telegram are, of course, parrot cries. The challenge to debate is sheer bravado, since writs have been issued in the Hursey case. It would be contempt of court to discuss the matter publicly. I studiously avoid discussing the Hurseys and confine my remarks to a man called Colrain  - a  financial member of the Waterside Workers Federation, who has not issued a writ. We are therefore free to discuss his matter fully. </para>
                    <para>Yesterday's press carried a report of  a  Waterside Workers Federation member, one Shackleton, who was sentenced to  a  month's imprisonment for attempting to run down with a motor vehicle Colrain and his child. That adds point to my reference to gangster methods on the Hobart waterfront. Colrain is being persecuted in a way that one would not believe possible on this side of the iron curtain. This stout-hearted unionist, of Scottish extraction, is being hounded personally, and also through his family and his womenfolk. As I said before, the film critics of this country said it was " strong meat " when Hollywood showed us Marlon Brando, in the film " On the Waterfront ", fighting against gangster control of a stevedoring union. Except for the difference in time, you would think that the Hollywood script writer was getting his facts from Hobart. </para>
                    <para>In the film we saw the horrible death  of  one of the unionists who had decided  to  expose the racket. He was crushed by  a  deliberate fall of whisky cases. In the case of Colrain, he was hit by a case of earth, which was dropped on him from the top of a hold. Fortunately, he was struck only a glancing blow on the shoulder and was not killed. An attempt was also made  to  knock him into an open hold. If either of those attacks had succeeded, it would have been a simple case of murder. </para>
                    <para>I am not one of those who believe that every member of the Labour party is1 a Communist or a Communist sympathizer. Far from it. But the silence of every member of- the Labour party on this issue has, been very difficult to understand. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.. Evatt's.</inline> implied! approval in a recent television interview of the waterside workers' conduct at Hobart would be the key to the situation. At all events, it is painfully clear that help for decency and freedom on the Hobart waterfront can come only from this Government, and I personally hope, apples or no apples, that that help will be forthcoming. </para>
