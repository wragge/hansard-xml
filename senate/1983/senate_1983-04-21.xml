<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is my privilege to congratulate you on your election as President of the Senate. I think I speak with the warm enthusiasm of all my colleagues on the Government side and, I hope, with the good will of all honourable senators when I say that I believe you will discharge with distinction and impartiality your duties as President of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My President, your qualifications for being President of the Senate are considerable. You were elected to the Senate in 1962. If my arithmetic is correct, that means that this is your twenty-first year as a member of the Senate. You have been a Chairman of Committees of the Senate. You were a Minister of State between 1972 and 1975. You have served on numerous committees of the Senate and, more recently, you have been Deputy President of the Senate. I believe it is appropriate that a Deputy President of the Senate should become, in the course of time and in the course of political wisdom in Australia, President of the Senate. Mr President I personally wish you well. I know that you start in your office with the support and good wishes of the members of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is my privilege on behalf of the Opposition and in particular on behalf of the Liberal Party senators in this place to congratulate you on your election as President. You are, of course, the father of this place. I suppose Senator Lewis , seeing Justin O'Byrne sitting upstairs, might have hoped that was a talisman for his election to the office you now hold. But I, on behalf of the Opposition, do extend you our best wishes and our congratulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button has referred to your very considerable experience in this place- to your role as Deputy President and as Chairman of Committees. Of course you are familiar with all facets of what happens in this chamber because you have served as a senator, as a senior member in opposition and as a Minister. I am sure, Mr President, that your experience makes you very aware of the importance of your role as far as the Opposition and minor parties are concerned and of the fact that we look to you for those standards of impartiality and fairness which I believe you displayed as Chairman of Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Mr President, we have confidence in you because of your recent experience and we look forward to working with you. I am sure that the work you did as Chairman of Committees was part of the reason that you got the support of the majority of honourable senators in the ballot today. I can assure you that you will have the full support of the Opposition in the discharge of your duties of office. As well as extending you best wishes from the Opposition I would like to extend my personal best wishes to you on your election to the presidency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on behalf of my party, the Australian Democrats, I give you our warm congratulations and assure you of our support. Although it was a secret ballot I make no secret of the fact that you won our support. You won our support for two reasons, which I stated a couple of years ago when we voted for the then Liberal -National Country Party nominee and which I state again now. We believe that this place is entirely separate from the Executive. It is a House of Parliament and is a separate arm of government from the Executive. Therefore, it is irrelevant which party is in power when determining who should be President of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, Mr President, that you are a member of the political party which has the greatest number of honourable senators in this place and because of that we think it fitting that you should be President. In the same way, we believe that a member of the party with the second greatest number of honourable senators in this place should be the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees in this place. The second reason you won our support is that we believe you to be a fine and proper person to hold this very important office. I am glad personally to see you there because I am pleased to have been able to call you a personal friend of mine over the last 21 years. </PARA>
<PARA> You have a difficult job ahead of you as your predecessors have had. It is a hung Senate; it will be an interesting Senate and a fascinating place in which to look at legislation. I have in mind that this Senate will run more smoothly with a greater deal of concensus than other Senates. I look forward to working with the leaders of the other parties and with you and your assistants in this place. The last Senate was not an easy one to chair, and I place on record my party's appreciation of your predecessor, Sir Harold Young, who, sometimes under extremely difficult circumstances, did what I believe to be a very creditable and worthwhile job. It is worthy to note that not once during his tenure of office was any motion of dissent from one of his rulings moved or even, as far as I am concerned, contemplated. You will have full support from us and I wish you well in your difficult task. </PARA>

I have had the privilege and, indeed, the pleasure of knowing you, Mr President, as a political opponent but certainly as an individual friend. I am sure that your capacity and the depth of your knowledge and experience in this chamber can only add to the efficiency of the chamber and, to the general atmosphere that must be generated in it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I join in congratulating you on your successful election to this very high office. It was not a surprise to me. My disappointment in the election is being on this side of the chamber and not on that side of the chamber. I am certainly not disappointed in your election as President. You and I have worked together on a number of Senate committees and over a period of almost seven years I believe we have become friends. I am certainly aware of your talents and your good humour which, I am sure, will come into play in this chamber from time to time. Yours is not an easy task. Some people seem to think that it is, but we who have sat in that chair know that it is not an easy task. Apart from the administrative roles, the control of this chamber, especially with the numbers the way they are, frequently proves to be a very difficult task. I am sure that your experience as a Minister, as a back bencher and as the Deputy President will show forth in the performance of your role. I am sure that you will perform your role as our President with distinction and dignity, and I support and endorse the remarks of others in congratulating you.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I also congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the Senate. In a former administration you were Minister for the Media. Despite your undoubted qualities in your involvement with the media and before television cameras, the President of the Senate does not require those qualities, even though there is something in the air about the televising of Parliament. The functions of the President of this chamber are the same as those of the president of any other organisation; that is to say, to uphold and preserve the integrity of the organisation or the institution and to uphold its rules and objectives against all comers. I am sure that the role of the Senate as a States' House, as the House with the powers to preserve the rights of individuals, will be upheld by you as its President, even if these areas come under attack from pressures from executive government and elsewhere. I wish you success in your role as President of the Senate and very much look forward to working with you.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I offer my personal congratulations to you. I think I can lay claim to being the senator who has known you longest, first meeting you when you held important positions in the Australian Labor Party organisation in the electorate of Barton when our leader was the late Dr Evatt. I can also lay claim to playing a significant part in my party in your election as a senator in 1961 and subsequently in your re-election in later preselection processes. Consequently you have been a personal friend of mine for all of those years-pretty close to 30 years. During that time we have enjoyed a warm and friendly relationship. I was able to accord you a vote when you were elected to the Ministry in 1972 and to see the important work that you did in several portfolios of the first Labor administration that had taken office since 1949.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is a fitting recognition of your service to the Parliament that you now have the support of the Senate in such a substantial way. I know that during the next period-we all hope it will be a long period-you will perform your duties as President of the Senate in the way in which you performed your duties as a Minister of the Crown. I agree with Senator Chipp; I am sure, Mr President, that the Senate will work in a much more co-operative way in the years that lie ahead and that you will apply yourself, in accordance with the impartial way in which you have been a member of the Senate, to the various rulings that you will be called upon to make. We hope that as our new President you will enjoy the co- operation that has been expressed by honourable senators opposite. You will certainly have the very strong support of the Government. I express my personal congratulations, and those of my family, to you. I also extend congratulations to your wife who is here today to see this important honour bestowed upon you. </PARA>

I also want to place on record my appreciation for the tremendous work put into this office by my immediate predecessor, Sir Harold Young. In the time that I was the Deputy President of the Senate and he was the President, notwithstanding the difference in political persuasions that we had, he was able to be of tremendous assistance to me in the occupancy of my position as Deputy President. No matter who will be chosen today to be the Deputy President, I sincerely trust that the relationship and close association that I was able to forge with Senator Sir Harold Young will be forged between me and my successor in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I appreciate what has been said by those who have spoken. I know my task will be a difficult one. I shall keep on hand the record of today's proceedings so that when I do make a ruling that is challenged I shall be able to pull it out and relate what has been said today. I am most grateful to those who have spoken, I shall tackle this task with enthusiasm and, I assure you, in a way which I trust will bring credit to the parliamentary institution. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> His Excellency the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President on his right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that His Excellency desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber forthwith.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the House of Representatives attending accordingly, with their Speaker-</PARA>
<PARA> His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia here assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> At the elections for both Houses of Parliament on 5 March 1983, the people of Australia declared firmly for a change of government and for a change of national direction.</PARA>
<PARA> You have been called together to consider a wide-ranging program of legislation designed to give effect to the mandate of the people.</PARA>
<PARA> The new Government has assumed office at a time of Australia's gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression fifty years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> In the twelve months from March 1982, unemployment grew from 6.6 per cent to 10 .4 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment among fifteen to nineteen year olds in the workforce rose above 29 per cent. It is estimated some two million of our fellow Australians are now living in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, my new advisers will give the highest priority to the task of restoring sustained growth to the Australian economy, now in deep recession.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, however, is deeply committed to the need for social, economic, legal and Parliamentary reform.</PARA>
<PARA> The work of reform, to create a more equal and a more just society, must continue side by side with the urgent task of removing the acute injustice and deprivation caused by Australia's present massive unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Economy</PARA>
<PARA> In fulfilment of an important undertaking given during the recent elections, my Government invited representatives of the governments, business and industrial unions of Australia to assemble in the national capital for a National Economic Summit Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> My advisers are confident that this historic Conference has achieved wider community understanding of the nature of the economic problems facing Australia and broad agreement upon a national effort to attack those problems.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement reached at the Conference contains the basic framework and approach to enable Australia to begin to arrest the serious economic decline and place the economy on a path of sustained, non-inflationary growth. My advisers have assured the participants at the Summit and their representative organisations of the Government's support and assistance in building upon the foundations laid so successfully at the Conference. An essential ingredient to the success of the Conference was the dissemination of information to an extent not previously attempted in Australia. My advisers have undertaken that this process of information-sharing, which they believe essential to the making of sound economic decisions, will continue.</PARA>
<PARA> Certain matters arising from the Conference will require legislative action which you will be asked to consider during this Session.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will establish an Economic Planning Advisory Council, representing governments, business, unions, farmers and community groups, to advise on economic developments and provide a forum for community consultation on national economic and social strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will establish a price surveillance mechanism to assess pricing decisions made by the strategic price setters, in both the private and public sectors. The Government will also review the structure and operation of the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority to ensure adequate supervision of petroleum prices.</PARA>
<PARA> My new Government has inherited a budgetary deficit problem of an unprecedented magnitude. A comprehensive review of budgetary commitments, both in terms of outlays and taxation expenditures, has been set in train.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, within the severe budgetary constraints it has inherited, the Government will give the highest priority to measures to create jobs and restore economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will give high priority to combating tax avoidance and evasion. Legislation on this and other taxation matters will be introduced during the present Session.</PARA>
<PARA>Employment and Industrial Relations</PARA>
<PARA> A Community Works Program will be established. This Program, including Jobs on Local Roads, will be designed to provide jobs on projects of lasting benefit to the community which would not otherwise have been commenced.</PARA>
<PARA> A new Private Sector Assistance Program will be introduced to co-ordinate and enhance the value of existing programs. This program will give special emphasis to the needs of the young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> An Australian Labour Office will be established to develop a comprehensive workforce strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> My advisers believe that better industrial relations are essential in the achievement of national economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA> To this end the National Labour Consultative Council will be developed as the major forum for consultation on industrial relations matters and a tripartite review of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act will be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be introduced this Session to abolish the Industrial Relations Bureau and to facilitate trade union amalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA> Measures will be taken to improve the working environment by programs to enhance the standard of occupational health and safety and by encouraging the expansion of industrial democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondary Industry</PARA>
<PARA> The development of a strong, competitive manufacturing industry will be of crucial importance to my Government's efforts towards national recovery and reconstruction. The Government will develop a program of industrial regeneration to revitalise existing industries and seek new opportunities for growth in areas of high technology. The Australian Industry Development Corporation will be given an enhanced status and provided with adequate funds to promote industrial reconstruction and develop new industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to preserve a viable and efficient steel industry and is engaged in consultation with a view to formulating a long-term development plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The technological capability of Australian industry will be improved by incentive measures to stimulate research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Industries Assistance Commission will be reviewed to ensure that its operations are directed towards the development and extension of industry. Temporary assistance and anti-dumping procedures are being reviewed as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA> It is my Government's policy not to reduce existing protection programs in current conditions of high unemployment. Legislation will be introduced to give effect to the accelerated depreciation allowance on plant and machinery, together with 2 1/2 per cent depreciation allowance on non-residential income- producing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament will be asked to consider a proposal for a Buy Australian Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Small Business</PARA>
<PARA> My Government recognises the vital contribution of the small business sector to the Australian economy. A National Small Business Action Program will be developed, designed to improve access to finance, to ease the tax burden as budgetary circumstances permit and to improve managerial skills.</PARA>
<PARA>Housing and Construction</PARA>
<PARA> In its efforts towards national recovery, my Government will give the highest priority to the revitalisation of the Australian housing industry. This priority reflects the social as well as the economic goals of my Government.</PARA>
<PARA> A range of policies will be implemented to increase access to housing. The Government's objectives are to increase significantly the availability of public housing and other low-cost rental accommodation, provide assistance in bridging the deposit gap, and ensure adequate funds are available for housing.</PARA>
<PARA>Trade</PARA>
<PARA> As a major world trading nation, Australia's economic strengths must depend on the strength of our export industries. Multilateral and bilateral trade policies will be pursued to ensure that markets for Australian exports are made secure and develop to their full potential.</PARA>
<PARA> The supporting services available to Australian companies will be improved. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation and the Trade Commissioner Service will be reviewed with a view to improving their effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industry</PARA>
<PARA> The rural sector remains of fundamental importance to Australia's export earning capacity. My Government is committed to progressive long term policies designed to ensure a strong rural sector. Although recent widespread rainfall has reduced the extent of the drought over Eastern Australia, a large area is still classed as rain-deficient.</PARA>
<PARA> Measures to ensure equitable treatment for farmers during the drought and beyond will continue to be given high priority.</PARA>
<PARA> The role and function of statutory marketing authorities will be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> A national soil conservation program will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation of significance to the rural sector will include reform of the administration of the meat and livestock industry, and a new wheat marketing plan to apply from the 1984-85 season.</PARA>
<PARA>Resources</PARA>
<PARA> In consultation with the States, my Government will review the Study on the Perspective on Water Resources to the Year 2000 as a basis for determining national water resource priorities. The Government will consider the establishment of an institute of freshwater studies to investigate water quality , and, as a matter of priority, advise on the equitable and effective management of the River Murray system.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will promote the pursuit of comprehensive knowledge of the oceans in the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is reviewing the operation of the Commonwealth and State legislation covering off-shore petroleum and mining activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian coal mining industry is experiencing severe problems, largely created by depressed international prices. An Australian Coal Consultative Council has been established so that governments, industry and unions can co- operate in the task of maintaining the strength and stability of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of national reconstruction calls for a major national effort to improve the efficiency of the basic economic infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>Transport</PARA>
<PARA> An Inter-State Commission will be established to develop a balanced national transport framework.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a national inquiry into the road freight industry to undertake, in co-operation with the States, a wide-ranging examination of the problems currently facing the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will continue, in addition to other road programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Measures will be taken in co-operation with the States, within current budgetary restrictions, to improve the efficiency of national rail services and to upgrade designated railway routes of national importance, including port and rail facilities for exports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is considering steps which might be taken to place the Australian Shipping Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission on an improved commercial basis. Legislation will be introduced to provide financial incentives for the expansion of Australia's shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia intends to become a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and the Protocol of 1978 which amends that Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government recognises the importance of the aviation industry to the Australian economy and the Australian quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA> The national airline, TAA, will remain in full public ownership. Consideration will be given to the capital needs of both TAA and Qantas and steps will be taken to place them on an improved commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is considering the establishment of an airports authority to plan , develop and operate the major airports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will promote participation by the community, the users and industry employees in decision-making on aviation issues, especially the provision of airports.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is mindful of the significance of the general aviation sector and will ensure that it is fully consulted on its regulation and levels of costs attributed to it.</PARA>
<PARA>Communications</PARA>
<PARA> You will be asked to consider legislation to establish the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to give the ABC a clear charter, a modern structure and effective, businesslike management.</PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting and Television Act will be amended to remove the ban on political news and comment applying to radio and television stations in the three days before Federal and State elections.</PARA>
<PARA> To stimulate innovation and expansion in the area of radio-communications and to control interference in the radio frequency spectrum, a radiocommunications bill will be introduced this Session.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government's efforts in the communications area will form a significant Australian contribution to the World Communications Year of 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will use the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme to encourage the development of new high technology industries in Australia, with particular emphasis on biotechnology.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia will increase the level of its scientific work in Antarctica and provide more effective transport links including landing strips.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will work to decrease Australia's technological dependence and raise levels of community understanding in science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the impact of technological change on educational and employment opportunities, the Government will allocate funds to provide secondary schools, including needy non-government schools, with computers. It is intended eventually to extend this program to primary schools.</PARA>
<PARA>Education and Youth Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of its pre-eminent concern to meet the needs of our young people , the new Government has established the Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs .</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to restore the confidence of the community in the nation's public education system while at the same time assisting in the operation of non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is firmly committed to the principle of genuine equality of educational opportunity and the elimination of disadvantage and discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA> A major effort will be applied to increasing the numbers of young people who complete their secondary education and to increasing the numbers who continue into tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA> The education assistance schemes will be progressively improved as budgetary circumstances permit.</PARA>
<PARA> In consultation with the States, my Government seeks to expand training opportunities in educational institutions for young people and adults affected by technological change and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to social and economic changes affecting work patterns and the availability of work, the Government will encourage developments designed to equip young people to engage in innovative enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> While current unemployment falls with particular severity on young people, the problem of the demand for jobs concerns the whole community. At the Economic Summit Conference, my advisers undertook to examine co-operatively the possibility of providing fulfilment in life for some of our people alongside the conventional production system.</PARA>
<PARA>Social Security</PARA>
<PARA> The deep economic recession has exposed serious inequalities in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is deeply committed to the elimination of poverty and gross inequality and a wide range of policies will be progressively implemented towards that goal.</PARA>
<PARA> My advisers note with deep satisfaction the centrality given to the need for reform in the welfare area during the recent Economic Summit Conference and in its communique.</PARA>
<PARA> The highest priority has been given to assistance to the unemployed and legislation will be introduced immediately to increase the single adult rate of unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> Further initiatives will be taken in the areas of child care, lone parents, the aged, widowed, invalid and the disabled and the sick.</PARA>
<PARA>Health</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will proceed to fulfil its undertaking with regard to the proposed Medicare arrangements, to ensure that the costs of health care in Australia are fairly shared and that proper health care is available to all.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will end the existing fragmentation of policies and funding for the aged through the creation of an Office of Aged Care. The Government proposes to modify the present over-emphasis on nursing home care for the aged and improve the availability of hostels and community care services.</PARA>
<PARA>Veterans' Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> A Royal Commission will be established to inquire into the effects of herbicides and pesticides on veterans of the Vietnam war.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will proceed to modernise the Repatriation Act, including the Appeals system, to remove existing anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA>Sport, Recreation and Tourism</PARA>
<PARA> The great cost to this nation of avoidable ill-health was a significant factor in my Government's decision to establish a Ministry of Sport, Recreation and Tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will move to increase the availability of sport, physical fitness and recreation facilities throughout the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government fully recognises the importance of tourism to the Australian economy. The role of the Australian Tourist Commission will be strengthened. Emphasis will be given to the promotion overseas of Australia's tourist potential and to measures to encourage domestic tourism.</PARA>
<PARA>The Arts</PARA>
<PARA> My Government places great importance on the role of the arts in the development of the national character and identity. Support for the arts will be aimed at widening the access to, and participation in, the arts by all sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of the Australian film industry will be encouraged by amendment to the legislation providing taxation incentives for the production of Australian films.</PARA>
<PARA>The Environment</PARA>
<PARA> My new Government has been elected with a very clear mandate from the people of Australia to protect the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is convinced that it would be a gross dereliction of its Constitutional responsibility were it to fail to carry out the clear wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> The national Government is obliged to protect Australia's natural and cultural heritage, including the South-West Tasmanian wilderness.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be introduced this day to protect areas identified as being of World Heritage status.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is also committed to investigating possibilities for alternative hydro electricity schemes and employment-generating activities in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will move to include the whole of the Great Barrier Reef in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government will improve the measures to protect Australia's fauna and flora, including the introduction of a national kangaroo monitoring group.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> My Government is deeply committed to the discharge of its Constitutional responsibility towards the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government seeks a national approach to the rights, status and living standards of these most disadvantaged of our fellow Australians.

At all stages, there will be full consultation with the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary, Legal and Constitutional Reform</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on behalf of Government senators I congratulate Senator Hamer on his election as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. Senator Hamer is a member of a well -known Victorian political family. Somehow members of that family always seem to get to the top and Senator Hamer is getting close to it now in the Senate. I should say that Senator Hamer came into the Senate in 1978 and in more recent years has been a Deputy Chairman of Committees. In that role he discharged his responsibilities with impartiality, fairness and, if I might say so, an encouraging appearance of interest in the debates which took place in this chamber. I wish him well, and do so on behalf of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

This morning I said on behalf of the Opposition that we expected and hoped that you would show the qualities of impartiality and fairness, and I say the same thing to Senator Hamer. Mr President, I am sure that all senators were heartened by your comments when you were elected about the successful way in which you had worked in harness with former Senator Sir Harold Young in the last Parliament, and I have no doubt that the combination in this Parliament will be just as happy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, a number of honourable senators here have tasted the delights of both chambers. Senator Hamer is one, Senator Jessop is another and Senator Chipp is another. I suppose it is true in this as in all things that the converts tend to be those who are most attached to the principles of what they are converted to. I have little doubt that Senator Hamer will, in his role as Chairman of Committees, look to the interests and traditions of the Senate and the protection of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I add the warm congratulations of the Australian Democrats to those extended to Senator Hamer upon his election. I have embarrassed him in public before by stating the very high regard we have for his ability. We have embarrassed him by criticising the Liberal Party on how unwise it has been in not using more fully a man of such talents as Senator Hamer. At least we can rest assured today that the Senate has had the wisdom to see and recognise those talents and to elevate him to this very high and respected position. We wish him well and offer our total support.</PARA></TALK.START>

On a number of occasions I have had the opportunity of serving on committees with Senator Hamer. I have always observed his very great capacity and, indeed, above all things, his fairness. I am sure that he will add a measure of distinction to the office to which he now succeeds. Perhaps I should know about that as I vacated that office some four years ago.

To those of us who served in the last Parliament Senator Hamer has already commended himself as a very effective Chairman of Committees. My association with him on the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs leads me to attest to his very keen intelligence, his following of an argument as to its relevance and his sense of humour. These are all qualities which I am sure he will bring to this chamber as we discharge the duties which the Governor-General indicated to us earlier in the day are our business for the coming Parliament.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I draw his attention to paragraphs 15 and 16 of the communique issued after last week's Summit, which read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 15. Business participants have emphasised their concern with overall unit costs of production and their importance in preserving the competitiveness of business and therefore its ability to survive, expand and create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> 16. They maintain that to achieve the growth in GDP and employment on which the nation's prosperity will depend, increased profitability is now essential if new investment is to be generated at an effective level.</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister explain why these crucial factors in Australia's economic recovery are attributed in the communique only to business participants in the Summit? Do the Government and the unions not share those views? Is there, in fact, no consensus over these matters which were put so ably to the Summit by members of the business community?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="22" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY & COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The outcome of the Summit was explained and articulated in a long communique in which there are many paragraphs which express the concern of all those who participated in the Summit. To take the two paragraphs out of context in the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has done perhaps reflects unfairly on the communique which was issued at the end of that meeting. The communique, in respect of all its paragraphs, was accepted by those members of the Government who were present at the Summit as a statement of shared views which arose from the Summit. The two paragraphs to which Senator Chaney referred are matters of concern to the Government, as they are to business participants in the Summit and, indeed, to trade union participants in the Summit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is it not a fact that the communique we have referred to contains paragraphs which refer to views of business participants in some cases, views of unions in others and views of the Summit as a third category? Is it not true that paragraphs which describe the views of business participants or, alternatively, union participants, do not have the unanimous endorsement of all the participants in the Summit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Insofar as the communique is expressed in the way to which Senator Chaney has again pointed, I agree that paragraphs are expressed as being the views of union representatives, articulated at the Summit. Others are expressed as being the views of business representatives. At the conclusion of the Summit the communique was adopted by all those present with the exception of Mr Bjelke-Petersen and the representative of the Law Council of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Colston has implied, the use of this form, which is extremely complicated, has caused great difficulties in pharmacies, both to pharmacists and to patients. My colleague in another place, Dr Blewett, has been consulting with the pharmaceutical profession and various pensioner groups and others to see what can be done about this matter but, of course, legislative changes are needed. Certainly the form, in its present form, will be abandoned. Agreement has been reached, I believe, with the pharmaceutical profession. The arrangements to abandon the form will be put to the Government shortly and I hope that in the May session of Parliament this matter will be resolved to everybody's satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>

I draw the former Attorney's attention to the terms of the detailed Press release which was issued jointly by myself and the Minister for Defence, Gordon Scholes, on 14 April and which describes, in very considerable detail-I am happy to seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard if it would assist the convenience of honourable senators-the precise course of events, who knew what and when. The reality of the matter is that when the news broke about the Mirage flight on the Sunday afternoon I had no knowledge that other than a single flight had taken place. It was not until Tuesday afternoon, as this statement clearly indicates, that I developed knowledge that there had been two flights. I would be only too pleased to endeavour to oblige the honourable senator with any other information that he seeks to extract from me.

<PARA>JOINT STATEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA>FLIGHTS OVER SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for a RAAF photographic-survey flight over the Tasmanian Dam site was first discussed on a Department to Department basis on Tuesday morning 5 April.</PARA>
<PARA> It was agreed by Attorney-General's Department and Defence Department officials that the most technically appropriate means of filming would be to use an F-111.</PARA>
<PARA> Later that day, the Attorney-General spoke to the Minister for Defence and requested the use of an F-111 for the purpose of evidence-gathering in the High Court action, if that was consistent with the RAAF's training and operational activity.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence agreed with the proposal, but requested confirmation in writing. That confirmation was supplied by the Attorney-General in a letter dated and signed the following day, Wednesday 6 April.</PARA>
<PARA> The detailed arrangements for the carrying out of the photography at the Attorney-General's request were then made by the RAAF.</PARA>
<PARA> In the belief that the photography was required by Thursday 8 April, and because of the unavailability on that day of an appropriately-equipped F-111, the RAAF tasked a Mirage for the flight, which took place on that day.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event, the photo coverage obtained by the Mirage proved incomplete, and the original task was completed by the F-111 when it became available on Friday 9 April.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither Minister became aware until significantly later that two aircraft rather than one had been used to complete the task.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Minister for Defence, this occurred when he received Departmental advice to this effect late on Monday afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Attorney-General, he had been alerted to the possibility of there having been more than one flight by his Departmental officers on Monday morning after he arrived in Canberra from Melbourne, but did not receive confirmation of this, or an explanation as to how it had come about, until he received from his Department late on Tuesday afternoon, 12 April, the same information from the Defence Department which had been given to the Defence Minister the day before.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister first became aware of the RAAF filming as a result of the press reports of the Mirage flight on Sunday 10 April.</PARA>
<PARA> Early on Monday morning he advised the Minister for Defence that no further use was to be made of Defence personnel or facilities in respect to the Tasmanian dam issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General first spoke to the Prime Minister on the question during the Monday morning break of the Summit Conference. In the course of that discussion-which focussed on the general question of principle involved in RAAF photo-reconnaissance of the dam site, and not matters of detail-he told the Prime Minister that he had just received information from the Attorney-General's Department from which it appeared that there may in fact have been two flights the previous week and that he was seeking verification of this.</PARA>
<PARA> No further substantive discussion on this issue took place between any of the three Ministers until today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to defend the decision I made to request a Royal Australian Air Force overflight of the dams. I find myself rather in the position, I suppose, of a judge at first instance who subsequently is overruled on a court of appeal. Having been overruled, I must have been wrong. I indicate to the Senate however, without seeking to defend that decision, that it was taken against a background of what appeared to me to be four highly relevant factors: First, the need to monitor closely the situation on the ground in the South West wilderness area to ensure that in the period between the commencement of the action and its hearing and determination by the High Court no irreparable damage took place. The second factor that I perceived to be relevant was the wildly inflammatory statements of the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray, over the weekend of 3 to 5 April which suggested that if there was any attempt to monitor that situation by way of the physical presence in the area of Federal police or anyone else, then a situation of physical violence could be expected.</PARA></TALK.START>

All sorts of inflammatory statements were being made by all sorts of people and it did not seem to me to serve the cause of rationality to have people crawling through the undergrowth with burnt cork on their noses or engaging in any other form of physical, on the ground, surveillance of that kind. The third factor that seemed to me to be of relevance in this situation, and against which my decision should be understood, is that it was undoubtedly the case, as I was advised by my Department and have subsequently confirmed, that RAAF photo reconnaissance of this kind is a thoroughly routine activity which has occurred on innumerable occasions and which I am happy, in answer to a later question, to elaborate should it become necessary and including situations where the military resources have been used in aid of the Commonwealth in its endeavour to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth relevant consideration which lay behind my decision was that, in the terms in which I made my decision and communicated it to the Department of Defence, nothing in the nature of a provocative flight would have taken place.

There was no element, I might add, in probable anticipation of a further question or supplementary question, of deception or intended deception involved in an RAAF over flight at that altitude for the simple and obvious reason that, if this material was to have been of any utility in the kind of interim injunction court proceedings for which it was designed, obviously it would have had to have been produced in evidence in the court and the source of the material disclosed. There was no element of deception intended , there was simply an element of provocation avoidance involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does he agree that this course of action, if pursued, constitutes a most flagrant breach of a specific promise made in writing to the Australian electorate during the election campaign and could, according to industry estimates, cost up to 8,000 jobs as the market would clearly prefer to buy imported tyres which would be cheaper than retreads if sales tax were applied?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will seek an answer from Mr Willis to the first part of Senator Chipp's question. In regard to the second part of his question, it is correct that the Minister for Finance stated that no action would be taken to overturn the determination previously made by the Commissioner of Taxation on this matter . There are a number of reasons for that decision. Firstly, and most importantly , the full enormity of the Budget deficit which this Government had inherited required the Government to look more closely at the revenue implications of the Taxation Commissioner's decision. Secondly, it is not correct, as Senator Chipp has said, that people will be buying new, imported tyres instead of having old tyres retreaded. It is not correct for two reasons: Firstly, because a person who supplies his or her own casing for a retread will not be liable to pay tax on the casing but will be liable to pay tax only on the retreaded component-the value added to the casing-and, secondly, because, according to the advice that I have received--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tax on the value added to it in precisely the same way that virtually all manufacturing output is subject to varying rates of sales tax . The second reason that they are not likely to do what Senator Chipp suggested is, I am advised, that the price of a new tyre of comparable size is $45.50; the price of a retread, even if the sales tax were applied to both the retread and the casing, would be about $28.60. Senator Chipp asked also about employment implications. Quite clearly the claims that it will cost 8,000 jobs are gross exaggerations. It is not at all clear whether there will be any net employment effects whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Childs asks me about a decision I made recently to overturn the decision made by the previous Government as a result of a recommendation of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions which sought to hand over to private enterprise a considerable proportion of the work undertaken by the Government; that is, work undertaken at repatriation and artificial limbs and appliance centres. I saw fit to change that decision because it was proven to be very costly to the Commonwealth. The figures show that, despite the fact that there was an increase of only 4.7 per cent from one year to the next in the manufacture of artificial limbs and that repairs decreased by 13.7 per cent, the total cost went up by a dramatic 28.8 per cent. So we finished up with no cost benefit as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions but an increase in government expenditure which denied the very purpose of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. I have taken the additional step of indicating that no new manufacturers will participate in the free limb scheme and that the Government's operation will continue, with a great deal of assistance from the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in general the Government will honour the funding commitments entered into by the previous Government. The centres which the honourable senator mentioned have created some difficulty for both the Federal Government and the South Australian State Government. The previous Government announced to the State Minister, the Honourable Greg Crafter, on 2 March, only three days before the election, the expenditure of some $500,000 under the States Grants (Home Care) Act on senior citizens centres, I think at Gawler, Elizabeth and Blackwood. Honourable senators may know that these centres are in fact funded by a combination of State and Federal Government money and in general the Federal Government follows as much as possible and within budgetary limits the recommendations of the State Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty in this situation was that there had been a change of government in South Australia in November. The present Minister involved, the Minister of Community Welfare, in fact was very surprised when he received on 2 March a Press statement announcing Federal Government funding for centres which was contrary to the advice he had been given. He thought that this was a funny way in which to consult with State governments. A similar situation happened in Western Australia where an attempt was made, according to my understanding, to get the State Labor Minister to agree with priorities which had been established by the previous Liberal Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> I found some difficulty when faced with a situation in which the previous Government quite clearly ignored the wishes of the existing State governments and chose to follow the views of the previous State Government, even though in South Australia that Government had been rejected by the people in the previous November. I also found it rather difficult to deal with grants which had been announced like this only two or three days before the election. Perhaps the Minister involved did not believe that anything could happen on 5 March. Unfortunately for him, it did.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no question that the people who sought funding for these senior citizens centres had their expectations raised. It was announced officially that they would receive such funding. In consultation with both State Ministers, we have agreed that it would be wrong of us in these circumstances to withdraw this funding even though the situation in Western Australia involves of necessity considerable funding in the next financial year. So the people involved in, I think, the Gawler, Elizabeth and Blackwood senior citizens centres can rest assured that they will get their funding. I am disturbed only at the manner in which those grants were announced by the previous Government and, in particular, their timing.</PARA>

We are distressed but not surprised because for some years now, prior to our being in government, we sought to raise this matter continually in this place and in the other place. We sought to persuade the previous Government to take some Commonwealth or Federal action in response to this extraordinary and intolerable situation.

These discussions are in progress and are continuing. The Federal Minister has called for an urgent report from his Department on the situation of Aboriginal health in Queensland.

In the case of the Northern Territory, of course, land rights have been enacted by the Federal Government. But it seems at this stage that the question of Tasmanian land rights will have to be resolved by some sort of Federal Government action, although clearly it is very early days and obviously a great deal of consultation with Aboriginal Tasmanians, the State Government and the Opposition in Tasmania will need to take place before an appropriate course of action can be determined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley opened her batting in this place by asking a question about the allocation of funds under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. The purport of the question and the answer taken together was that there was something to be disturbed about in the manner in which funds were allocated under that Act, in particular in Western Australia and South Australia. As I was the Minister concerned, I would like to advise the Senate that, as was put down by Senator Grimes in his answer, those decisions are made by the Commonwealth following advice from State governments, which advice is based on criteria which have been laid down, such as numbers of aged and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all cases that I can recall I acted upon State advice in making approvals or in approving grants under that Act. I have no recollection at all of the particular circumstances in South Australia, apart from receiving representations from all around Australia from individual centres to which my response was that it was a matter which would have to await State government recommendation. I have no recollection of anything other than simply accepting the Department's recommendation. With respect to Western Australia, at the request of the State Minister, the original recommendation to make grants to, I think, three centres, the third of which was the shire of Rockingham, was reconsidered. The State Minister at the time in the previous Government, Mr Young, sought a revision on the basis that another centre in the shire of Melville might be included. I sought further advice from my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a change of government. I had some representations from the State Minister. Following those representations, with his approval, people from my office spoke with officers of his State Department who confirmed a State view that the grants should be made to the three centres originally recommended and the centre at Melville. I checked, and my understanding is that the centre at Melville is in a Labor State electorate and in a Labor Federal electorate. I proceeded with the totality of the grants which had been somewhat delayed by the back and forth which had occurred. I wish to reject any suggestion that there was any political motivation in what occurred at that time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate, recognizing the desirability of a thorough review of the Australian Constitution in the light of experience since its establishment and of modern day requirements, agrees that the Commonwealth Parliament continue its participation in the Australian Constitutional Convention established to review the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and accordingly resolves:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That, for the purposes of the Convention- (a) a delegation from the Commonwealth Parliament take part in the deliberations of the Convention, and comprise sixteen members of the Parliament of whom six shall be members of the Senate and ten shall be members of the House of Representatives;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the six members of the Senate comprise three members of the Australian Labor Party, two members of the Opposition and one member of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That- (a) three Senators being members of the Australian Labor Party, nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) two Senators being members of the Opposition, nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) one Senator being a member of the Australian Democrats, nominated by the Leader of that Party in the Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>be members of the Delegation:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) That the Prime Minister be the Leader of the Delegation, and the Leader of the Opposition be the Deputy Leader:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) That a member of the Delegation cease to be such a member if- (a) he ceases to be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the House of the Parliament of which he is a member terminates his appointment; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) he resigns as a member of the Delegation by writing addressed to the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case requires. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) That where, because of illness or any other cause, a member of the Delegation is not available to attend a meeting, or part of a meeting, of the Convention, the Leader or senior available member of the Party in the House from which the member was drawn may nominate an alternate member (being a member of the House of which the first-mentioned member is a member) and the member so nominated shall be a member of the Delegation for that meeting, or that part of that meeting:</PARA>
<PARA> (6) That, in the event of a member of the Delegation ceasing to be such a member, the Leader of the Party in the House from which the member was drawn may nominate another member (being a member of the House of which the first- mentioned member is or was a member) to replace the first-mentioned member:</PARA>
<PARA> (7) That the Leader of the Delegation from time to time make a report for presentation to each House of the Parliament on matters arising out of the Convention, and that the Deputy leader of the Delegation may make an accompanying report. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) That a message be sent to the House of Representatives acquainting it of the resolution agreed to by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention to be held this year in Adelaide will be the fifth plenary meeting of the Convention. Since the last Convention in Perth in 1978 the standing committees have considered a number of proposals arising from that Convention. On this occasion the Convention will conduct its business in the presence of a number of officially accredited services which will widen the range of participation in the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion I moved is in very similar terms to the motion which was moved prior to the 1978 Convention and earlier motions. It, of course, relates specifically to Commonwealth representation. That will be fixed at 16 delegates, with each State sending 12 delegates and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each sending two delegates. There will also be delegates from local government and representatives from each State. There appears to be some concern about the personnel who will attend the Constitutional Convention as representatives of the Commonwealth Parliament. I understand that a document has been circulated in the chamber showing the names of the proposed personnel. The names of the senators representing the Government at the Convention are: Senator Button, Senator Evans and Senator Tate. Mr President, I understand that Senator Chaney, as Leader of the Opposition, will inform you of the names of the Opposition representatives. </PARA>
