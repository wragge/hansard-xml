<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the request of Senator Grimes, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, he will move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> noting that, in 1967, an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia voted to amend the Constitution so that this Parliament would have the power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to the people of any race for whom it was deemed necessary to make special laws;</PARA>
<PARA> noting also that the change to the Constitution was made to enable the national Parliament to discharge a national responsibility to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> bearing in mind that the Senate unanimously adopted the following resolution on 20 February 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> 'That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for the dispossession of their land':</PARA>
<PARA> (1) acknowledges that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the peoples whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of Australia and had occupied the territory of Australia for many thousands of years in accordance with an Aboriginal system of laws which determined the relationship of Aboriginal responsibility for and to the land to which they belonged;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) from the time of arrival of representatives of King George III of England, and the subsequent conquest of the land and the subjugation of the Aboriginal people, no settlement was concluded between those representatives and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) as a result of the colonization of the land by Great Britain the rights of the original owners and prior occupiers were totally disregarded;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) since the arrival of European settlers in Australia, the original inhabitants have been dispersed and dispossessed with the result that their descendants are, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) this disadvantage persists, despite measures taken by State, Territory and Australian Governments, and by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves, so that further measures by Australian society as a whole, and by the Parliament of the Commonwealth in particular, will be required to ensure real equality and advancement for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) considers, therefore, that the special measures which must be taken include action in the following main areas-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The development of effective processes of consultation with Aboriginal people in order that the Aboriginal people may assert control of all aspects of their lives, having regard to the National Aboriginal Conference's responsibility to represent and present the views of Aboriginal and Islander people throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the recognition by this Parliament of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's rights to land, in accordance with the following five basic principles:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Aboriginal land to be held under inalienable freehold title;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) protection of Aboriginal sites;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Aboriginal control in relation to mining on Aboriginal land;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) access to mining royalty equivalents; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) compensation for lost land to be negotiated;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the continuation and acceleration of programs designed to ensure Aboriginal equality of opportunity in fields including health, education, housing, employment and welfare;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the development of programs by all appropriate means to enable Aboriginal people to take part in economic activities for their own advantage;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the promotion and protection of Aboriginal cultural identity, in ways considered appropriate by Aboriginals, including measures designed to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) codify in writing Aboriginal languages, and assist in recording oral history;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) preserve and protect Aboriginal sites and objects;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) restore to Aboriginal people sacred objects relevant to their history, tradition and culture;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) enhance the development of traditional or contemporary art forms; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) provide interpreter services;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) restoration of the rights of Aboriginal families to raise and protect their own children by means of uniform laws and procedures in respect of child custody , fostering and adopting;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) respect for, and in appropriate circumstances, the application of, Aboriginal customary law and related practices as part of the law of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the development of improved community relations between Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal Australians, which requires a growing understanding on both sides by means of:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) public education programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) fostering the study of Aboriginal history, language, anthropology and archaeology in Australian schools and institutions of learning; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) is therefore of the view that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Australian people will be truly free and united only when the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this nation are free of the distress, the poverty and the alienation that has been their lot; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Bicentennial year of 1988 provides an immediate focus point towards which all Australians can work together to achieve the objectives set out in this resolution.</PARA>

It has been apparent for some years that the Wireless Telegraphy Act has been unsatisfactory and the Hon. Neil Brown Q.C., a former Minister for Communications, began work in 1982 and late last year produced a piece of legislation. The draft Bill was issued late in 1982 not only for public comment but also to get public discussion on differences which the Bill contained from the report of the Davidson Committee of Public Inquiry into Telecommunication Services in Australia. A seminar was held soon after the change of government in April 1983 and the Labor Government has picked up the Bill which was prepared by its predecessors, has advanced it into the Parliament and presents it now for the approval of the Parliament. The Bill, which deals mainly with transmission through the radio waves, is a necessary updating of the legislative framework.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, if one takes it from the last annual report, is to encourage Australia's export trade in goods and services by providing a specialised range of insurance guarantee and financing facilities not normally obtainable from the commercial market. It is worth remembering that the Corporation was first set up by a Liberal government to ensure that Australian exporters were not disadvantaged in terms of the facilities available to their overseas competitors. This obviously requires a change from time to time in the powers of the Corporation in response to changing international trading circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first paragraph of the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Button) indicates that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill proposes essentially technical amendments. However, as one reads further it becomes apparent that that is very much an understatement. In fact, the Government plans a very different charter for the Corporation. Most importantly, the Government has decided to remove the restrictions which generally limit EFIC services to those not normally available from the private sector. Thus in its export bank and insurance function it can be expected to compete with the private sector in future. Furthermore, as stated by the Minister, exporters will no longer be required to demonstrate a need to meet competition when seeking concessional export finance. Rather the EFIC, subject to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development undertakings, will take the initiative in determining appropriate credit terms. In other words , the Corporation will be able to give concessional finance to facilitiate developments of what are described in the Minister's speech as 'worthwhile trade development prospects'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore raises all the difficult questions concerning the role of government and public money in trade development. The Government claims to have accepted a challenge to revitalise our export sector and clearly sees for itself an important role. Not only do we have this Bill but also we have in mind the Government's intentions in relation to an overseas trading corporation. Furthermore, the Government is placing an emphasis upon the export of manufactured goods, which raises the whole question of past policy and public funding being primarily orientated towards import protection in this sector rather than export development. Therefore, as I indicated at the commencement of my contribution, the Bill is important and raises important decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The structural changes that have taken place in Australia's trade over the last decade are well known. Briefly I remind the Senate that the rural sector currently represents about 42 per cent of total exports compared with 80 per cent in the 1950s. This decline in the share of rural exports has in turn been matched by strong growth in exports of fuel and minerals which has accounted for the bulk of Australia's export growth in the last three decades. In 1980-81 fuel and mineral exports accounted for 40 per cent of Australia's exports, compared with less than one-tenth in the 1950s. Similarly in direction there has been a major change with a significant decline in the importance of the United Kingdom market and the diversification of exports to the expanding markets of the Western Pacific region and to the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> What is less well known is our relatively poor export performance. First, in both volume and value terms, Australia's trade performance has been below the annual average rate of growth for the world as a whole. Through the 1970s our share of total world trade fell from 1.69 per cent to 1.18 per cent. In fact, of the 33 largest exporters for which data is available, all but three achieved higher export growth rates than Australia. During the 1970s, Australia's international purchasing power increased by only 7.4 per cent. The increases for some countries broadly comparable to Australia were significantly greater: Canada, 66.3 per cent; New Zealand, 27.1 per cent; South Africa, 78.4 per cent; and Brazil, 128.5 per cent. Available International Monetary Fund data indicates that the only country to do worse than Australia during the 1970s in terms of improved purchasing power was Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, although export markets have expanded in absolute terms, Australia has fallen back in its market share in many of its principal export markets. For example, Australian import penetration into Japan reached a peak of 9.39 per cent in 1972 but by 1979 it had declined to 5.69 per cent. Australian production as a percentage of all United States imports was 1.53 per cent in 1973, but by 1979 it had fallen back to 1.09 per cent. Over the same period, while Australian exports to China, Italy, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the Association of South East Asian Nations have increased in both volume and value, market pene- tration has fallen. This dissappointing export performance appears to reflect Australia's declining standard of living relative to that of many of our trading partners. Given our small domestic market, an improved export performance would appear to be obviously critical in reversing that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of reasons for our poor trade performance appear obvious. First, the relatively high concentration of exports in primary products. Not only have Australian primary products been one of the slowest growth sectors in world trade over recent years, they have also been concentrated in slow growth areas of North America and Europe. Agricultural trade has, of course, been subject to extensive trade barriers and export subsidies most evident in the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community countries. Secondly, Australia has not been able to compete with the industrialised nations of South East and East Asia in ensuring exports markets in manufactured commodities. Australia's industrial policy has remained of the same character over the last 30 years, as I said, essentially one of import replacement rather than export orientated. The result has been the development of a broadly based manufacturing sector which, while initially import competitive, has been increasingly unable to withstand import competition. Thirdly, we have seen a declining competitiveness of the Australian trade sector with high domestic labour costs, prohibitive transport costs, and at times poor exchange rate management and inappropriate taxation policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia retains a high ranking in primary and extractive commodities because of an obvious competitive advantage. That competitive advantage can be undermined by inappropriate policies such as high tariffs on imported plant and equipment and uncompetitive shipping rates. However, a further comparative advantage we have is our location in the Asian-Pacific region. We are located in the most rapidly growing, economically speaking, region of the world and a region of dynamic economies based on outward looking trade orientated industrialisation strategies. We have a clear contrast with some western European economies which have stagnated. Projections of their future have been dominated by a preoccupation with policy directed at the stabilisation of incomes and economic structures, which has resulted in slower gross domestic product growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's approach to its economy has been of the industrialised West European mould, and with a similar result. Our reaction to the economic dynamism of our region has been one of despair rather than recognition of the tremendous trade opportunities which that gives us. High growth rates and trade orientated development strategies within our region are expected to continue. By the end of this century, the Asian Pacific region will encompass an immense economy, certainly, far from fully integrated but with high degrees of interdependence in many spheres. Market opportunities for Australia will be great, but it will require different attitudes if we are not only to protect our natural competitive advances in relation to primary products but also to maximise the opportunities presented by this regional economic growth. It will be the manufacturing sector which will face the greatest challenge. Peter Vidler of the economics and commerce group of our Parliamentary Library, in a recent paper, said:</PARA>
<PARA>While there will continue to be a demand for Australian mineral resources from Asia, the challenge arising from the growth of Asian countries lies in the implications for manufacturing industry. As countries such as Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong move to more advanced stages of development, their import demand will also change from predominately natural resources, to include semi processed material and items of capital equipment. Australia's economic opportunities will be maximised if it can reorient its manufacturing sector away from its domestic market orientation to meet this new demand. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the traditional labour intensive Australian manufacturing sector will be incapable of sustaining any significant competitive presence. It must shift away from its concentration on high labour input and low value-added production towards more capital intensive high value-added products, which can find market niches in the expanding Asian economies. We must build on the comparative advantages of our resource and energy endowments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, but the question is whether one can create employment by continuing with the policies of the past or whether one has to look in a new direction. I am suggesting that a new direction will be essential. I am saying that we must not disregard the comparative advantages which we have; we must build upon them. Those comparative advantages, obviously, are resource and energy endowments, and to date a relatively well-educated work force. Technology intensive industrial activities offer major opportunities for generating more wealth and increased employment. In the key technology areas, particularly in the fields of electronic technology, communication technology, biotechnology, computer software, lasers for medical technology, to name only a few, opportunities abound. I remind Senator Harradine that we have shown that we can build on our comparative advantages in computer control, mining processes and high technology dry land farming techniques. We may not be able to compete in the manufacture of microchips, but we can compete in the development possibilities spawned by the new technology. These are new, different goods, systems and services which would be not only import competitive but also export seeking.

<PARA> Product and market opportunities in some traditional areas are declining while new opportunities, for example in skills and services, are emerging. Other nations are already responding to these world developments and Australia needs to move quickly if it is to take advantage of new product and market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>The panel reminded us that such changes are most graphically evident in our major trading partner, Japan. Traditional Australian exports face static or declining markets in Japan. Yet changing industry structures and consumption patterns are creating substantial new and rapidly growing markets in a segment of the Japanese market that Australia has barely broached. To retain Australia's trading status in Japan and generate employment in Australia we must find a way into the growing segments of the Japanese import market, and this will require a more substantial and imaginative commitment to the market than has been mounted to date. For Australia to meet this challenge it will require outward-looking entrepreneurs, a dedicated work force, the production of high quality, imaginitive-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I know some people think it would be better if we spent all day debating the Sex Discrimination Bill. There are some in this chamber who think there are other subjects that are at least as important. However, this will require the right policies from government. These will include not only the right macro-economic policies affecting the competitiveness of Australia's exports, for example exchange rate, fiscal and monetary policy, but also specific policies, for example export credit to which this Bill relates and export market development grants, which we debated last year. The panel identified a number of specific areas in which government policy can make a positive contribution to an improved trade performance. The first area related to offsets. The panel mentioned the fact that offset opportunities amounting to some $1.5 billion are currently outstanding against existing contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would take longer if I did that. I was about to refer to a number of specific suggested areas in which government policy can make a positive contribution to an improved trade performance. The first I mentioned related to offsets. I reminded the Senate that offset opportunities amounting to some $1.5 billion are currently outstanding against existing contracts at a time of underemployment in the Australian economy. I should have thought that that would be of particular interest to the Senate. The panel supports a greater focus of attention being placed on non-defence offsets and a correspondingly closer role for the Minister for Trade in the development and implementation of the offsets program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the panel believed that greater emphasis should be placed on the utilisation of Australian goods and services in support of the Australian aid program. Thirdly, the panel noted the value of government purchasing and the promotion of industries with export potential, particularly in areas such as high technology and consultancy contracting. Fourthly, the panel noted the number of companies in Australia-some 900-which are subject to export franchise restrictions covering some 5,400 exportable profit areas and suggested that perhaps a policy of incentives should be provided to encourage multinationals to liberalise franchise restrictions. I should have thought that that would be particularly important to those on the other side. Fifthly, the panel felt that greater emphasis should be given to Australian investment overseas which would allow the investor to take advantage of expected growth in the host country market, overcome tariffs and other import barriers and gain access to markets adjacent to the host country. Sixthly, the panel raised the problem of State- Commonwealth relations and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The competition among States in areas of promotion of exports, state government purchasing and offsets programs is costly, has resulted in fragmentation of industry development in Australia and has created confusion in the minds of overseas governments and business as to the respective roles of the Commonwealth and States in external trade. </PARA>
<PARA>Seventhly, the panel raised the interesting subject of the marketing of public sector skills. It said that in areas such as health, education, power generation , and agriculture there are skills and expertise within Australia which have the potential to be marketed overseas. These are the different directions for which I presume Senator Harradine was searching. However, what comes out most clearly from the report is the lack of a long term, external commercial strategy for Australia, a lesson that should be learned from the Government-determined goals of Japan. I gather from the agitation in the chamber that the Senate is very anxious to proceed with the Sex Discrimination Bill. If I might return to the Bill before us and the expanded role that it gives the Government in relation to trade credit, the Minister used a number of times, in his second reading speech, the word 'aggressive'. I think there is a need for Australia to become more aggressive in its export performance. For too long we have followed rather than led. Therefore, I support the extension of favourable credit terms to allow new market opportunities to be seized, rather than simply to combat the competition of others. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the extension of services that may be otherwise obtainable from the commercial market, I remind the Senate that the support of the Campbell Committee for the Corporation seems to be based largely on the fact that it fills what is at present a market gap. For the Corporation to go further and duplicate services that are offered by the commercial sector would appear to offer nothing further, or better, than currently exists. There are sufficient challenges for the Government in the area of trade development without duplicating what already exists. However, in general I welcome the updating of the Corporation, the recognition by the Government of the importance of an export manufacturing sector and the contribution that it claims to be willing to make towards more aggressive marketing. I trust that it will give further attention to the deficiencies identified by the panel to review the Australian Trade Commissioner Service, and recognise the urgent need for an export policy that is based on the challenges of the future, not of the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Life Insurance Amendment Bill and the Insurance Amendment Bill. The Opposition supports each of these Bills. Because of the pressures of time I will restrict my comments to the Insurance Amendment Bill. The main features of that Bill are designed to strengthen the financial standards imposed on general non-life insurance companies. These strengthening provisions are aimed at two principal areas-to increase the paid-up capital and solvency requirements. The motivating forces which have caused the Government at last to act in this area are the recent collapses in the insurance industry of companies such as Palmdale Insurance Ltd and Bishopsgate Insurance Australia Ltd, in addition to a number of collapses of brokering firms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years a number of people have recognised that the crux of the problem in the insurance industry can be sheeted home to two principal areas. Firstly, both the Insurance Act and the Insurance Commissioner have been toothless tigers . In addition to that, there has been no attempt to control brokerage operations within the industry. The main thrust of the Insurance Commissioner's reports on the general insurance industry in recent years has been directed towards the failure, firstly, to lodge returns on time. In certain circumstances when some of the returns are received by the Commissioner there has also been the question of the ability of the Commissioner's Office to interpret the financial thrust of some companies. Remedial action has therefore been required in this area. The same problem arose in the United Kingdom with the Board of Trade having a similar problem. One can cast one's mind back several years to the collapse of Vehicle and General in the United Kingdom. The problem was predominantly not located until it was too late. There appear to be similar sorts of difficulties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> But unlike the banking industry, where the Federal Government determines what overseas banks can operate in Australia, over the last decade insurance interests from overseas have entered the market in Australia with certain detrimental effects upon the whole industry. The advent some decades ago of overseas insurance in the Australian market was the signal for a price-cutting war, the responsibility for which must largely be accepted by the insurance brokers of Australia playing one insurance company off against another and eventually finding the weak reeds within the industry. At last the Federal Government, in its attempt to stabilise the insurance industry for the benefit of the consumers, has decided to act. The amendments in clause 16 of the Insurance Amendment Bill provide some limitations on what is deemed to be proper to include as assets, for example, a limit on outstanding premiums. Clause 16 places some limitations on the extent to which outstanding premiums can be brought into account as assets. Proper registration of brokers with the insurance industry in Australia would go a long way towards returning stability to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the introduction of a Bill, perhaps in the autumn session of Parliament, to fulfill this need. All brokers should be registered and the condition of their registration should be such that it would bring about a stability which would ensure a better result for the industry generally. Historically one of the weaknesses within the insurance industry is the granting of credit. This problem is highlighted particularly with major companies whose insurance program is handled by brokers. It is a commonly accepted fact that the due date is reached before negotiations take place with the insurer. This means, in effect, that they are buying time. There is probably a period of negotiation of two, three, four months or even longer before the final terms and conditions are agreed upon for the policy year. The result of this is that the broker does not receive premiums, nor are they passed on to the company, for up to six to nine months. This must be a disability for the insurance industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> No one would deny that the law of insurance requires clarification. It is also clear that with rapidly changing technology, not only in industry but also in commerce, the insurance industry has been under great stress to keep pace with these changes. But it is not enough on its own to clarify the law of insurance, to clear up issues regarding policy wording and contracts for the benefit of the consumer. It goes much deeper than that. The whole financial structure of the industry must also be streamlined in order that people's interests are protected at all times and that company collapses can be minimised. The main concern of the insurance industry should be financial stability so that the client is protected at all times and is not faced with the prospect of his policy being worthless. It may well be that, apart from the annual returns that are submitted by companies to the Commissioner, there should be some form of quarterly return. I welcome the improvements that are in this Bill. I, on behalf of the Opposition , support both of these Bills. </PARA>

The question I was asking, because I think it is relevant and will be of a great deal of interest to many employers, is this: Is it an offence for an employer, in his or her naivete, to ask an employee whether she is married and whether she is planning to have a family in the immediate future? The question is being asked because the position is such that it would require considerable training for the employer to receive any benefit, reward or return for the investment in the employee, and an employer would require an employee to spend considerable time in the position. The question is: Is it an offence to ask either of these questions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To refresh the memory of the Committee, the provisions of clauses 5 and 6 outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status. The amendment that has been moved by the Opposition is to incorporate the words 'and the less favourable treatment is not reasonable in the circumstances'. I draw the attention of the Committee to the comments that were made by the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Ryan) on Tuesday evening when we were last discussing this matter. The Minister, in her responses to the questions that were asked, used the word 'reasonable'. Quite clearly, that is the only way that these measures can be truly anti-discrimination measures; in other words, to ensure that these measures are not used for ulterior purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The example I gave of the possible operation of clause 6, which deals with discrimination on the ground of marital status, has not been properly answered by the Minister. Because the definition of martial status includes the de facto spouse of another person, and because that then in turn places marital status, for the purpose of this clause, at the same level and on the same status as a bona fide marriage relationship, it creates and will create problems. As I indicated on the previous occasion, the United Nations Convention was not intended to do that. It was not intended to palce a de facto relationship on the same basis as a bona fide marriage relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Committee's attention again to the possible effect of this clause on , for example, an owner of a hotel in a country town in which there may be two hotels. In a number of towns I know, there are more hotels than residences; but I just take as an example the more typical country town, perhaps, in which there are two hotels. Those hotels are the centre for the social life of the community . Let us say, for example, that the hotel-keeper wanted to go away and wanted to ensure that his hotel was properly cared for and was properly run as the social centre of the town and that he gave the hotel charge to a manager. Let us suppose that the manager is a married man in the town and that whilst the hotel- keeper is away, he shacks up with a barmaid. Under this measure, the hotel- keeper cannot, in those circumstances and for that reason, sack the manager. </PARA>

In those circumstances, the hotel-keeper, under this measure, would not be able to sack the manager. The licensing authority could do nothing about it, and the hotel- keeper would lose his business because all the locals would go down to Jack Ryan 's to engage in their social life there. Surely this is not a matter with which this Bill was designed to interfere; not with those sorts of rights and responsibilities. That is one of the reasons why I sought to have deleted from the definition of 'marital status' the aspect of a de facto spouse. Unfortunately, I received no support from the Opposition, the Liberal Party or the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

But these are the aspects of the measure that have not been fully considered. When I was attempting to explain the situation, I am afraid that the Committee was discussing matters individually with other people and not a great deal of attention was being paid to the matters that were raised at that particular stage. In particular I refer to the matter that I alone can raise in this chamber because I was the only one from this chamber who was present-that is, the matter relating to the development of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the drafts of the United Nations Convention. No mention was made of de facto spouse being given the same status as married spouse under the marital status provisions of the United Nations Convention. I again raise that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To retrieve the situation somewhat, it is necessary to support the Opposition's amendment. I do support the Opposition's amendment. To retrieve it further, it will be necessary subsequently, although it will not overcome the whole problem because of the matters that have just been raised, to place in a conscientious objection clause not specifically for the de facto situation but, more importantly, for greater and graver issues that will arise as a result of this legislation. I support the proposal by the Opposition to add at the appropriate parts of clauses 5 and 6 the words 'and the less favourable treatment is not reasonable in the circumstances'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for his support of our amendment. I also thank him for reminding the Committee of the points he was making at the end of the debate on Tuesday night. I respond to the statement of Senator Harradine when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I believe that the Opposition's amendment is probably adequate, I would have picked up what the Minister said and used the words 'reasonably relevant in the circumstances' rather than 'reasonable in the circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA>I say two things: First of all, I think the phrase 'reasonable in the circumstances' carries with it relevance. If we are talking about a particular situation, we are talking about whether something is relevant. However, if the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Ryan) were to indicate that she would prefer the amendment to read 'reasonably relevant in the circumstances' and the Government were to accept that amendment, I would be quite happy to change our amendment to that wording. I want to make one other point. I made some reference on Tuesday night to clause 30 (2). The Minister in debate pointed out that clause 30 (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Without limiting the generality of sub-section (1), it is a genuine occupational qualification, in relation to a particular position, to be a person of a particular sex (in this sub-section referred to as the ''relevant sex'' if- . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (h) the position is declared, by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph, to be a position in relation to which it is a genuine occupational qualification to be a person of a particular sex. </PARA>
<PARA>This follows a number of paragraphs which are exemptions in a sense to this section on prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sex and to which we seek to add the words 'reasonable in the circumstances'. I indicate to the Government that, whilst paragraph (h) of clause 30 (2) may well pick up a number of the sorts of things that people have in their minds when they are attracted to our amendment, it is not desirable in my opinion for these things to be done by government regulation. It would be better to give the Commissioner the right to make that judgment in individual cases. The Commission will become very experienced in the matter and I am sure that it will embark on the implementation of this Bill in the way it is meant to be implemented. But I am also sure that there will be some cases that come to it, which will be difficult for it, where a fairer and more acceptable decision could be made on the matters of sex discrimination and marital status if the words 'and the less favourable treatment is not reasonable in the circumstances' were there and the Commission did not have to rely on perhaps making some report to government about some regulation that may need to be made in a certain situation that has been overlooked in paragraphs (a) to (g). Of course, in the meantime, even if the Government accepted that and regulated accordingly, the Commission would have had to rule against someone, even though its ruling may be not entirely reasonable. I reiterate that the Opposition is not attempting to water down the Bill. It is trying to make the Bill more acceptable and fairer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What are you doing?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first amendment which I will put forward will not clarify the intention of what I am attempting to do; so I thought I would foreshadow two further amendments to clause 40 (1). I am simply refining the definition of marital status because the most obvious discrimination against non-working spouses is in the income tax laws. If a spouse is considered dependent then, according to the Australian Taxation Office, she is not entitled to any of her husband's income. This is commonly called splitting of incomes. That will clarify the situation for Senator Georges. I believe that a husband and wife are a partnership. It is only through the work of the wife in the home and the fact that she does run the home and look after the children that the husband is able to earn the income that he does. I believe that the Australian Taxation Office discriminates against the non-working spouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give some figures, though I do want to be brief. The husband of a couple earning half the average weekly income-$8,899, which is a very small income-pays $395 in tax each year. That is a gross injustice. I believe that if he has a dependent spouse he is able to earn his income only because she does as much as she does for him. They are in partnership. They should be able, if they so choose, to split their income. If that were permissible and if the wife were not discriminated against in that situation that family would not be paying tax at all. I do not believe that a couple on that sort of income, particularly if they have children, should pay tax at all. If the average weekly wage of $17,000 is earned the husband pays a considerable amount of tax, totalling $3,121. If the splitting of income were allowed the husband would pay $1,358, the wife would pay the same and there would be a saving of $405 in the tax bill for that family . For Senator Georges's information I am suggesting that if the wife is at home, looking after dependent children and doing normal household chores, if her life is one of supporting her husband, she is in effect in partnership with her husband and should be entitled to the tax free area that other people are entitled to. We discriminate against her by not allowing her that tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting that the Bill ought to fix that discrimination, and I will attempt to do this with my additional clause 6(3). Later I will move other amendments to rectify the injustice whereby non-earning spouses are discriminated against. If the Government believes that this Bill will create justice and do away with discrimination in all areas except, as it has already said, the social welfare area-of course the taxation area has not been mentioned -I believe that we must, in all justice, go the whole way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak any further on that, Mr Chairman. I hope that the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Ryan) can explain the Government's position to me. I now move:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Page 7, after sub-clause 6 (2), add the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(3) Where a person who is married and who is not engaged in remunerated employment is, by reason of those conditions, treated less favourably, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, than another person to whom either of those conditions does not apply, that first-mentioned person shall be taken to have been discriminated against on the ground of the martial status of that first-mentioned person.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept Senator Walters's amendment for the same reasons that Senator Martin has just explained as to why the amendment is unacceptable to the Opposition. It is well beyond the scope of this Bill to start to make changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Government has the matter of taxation under review through the operation of the Economic Planning Advisory Council and Senator Walters is welcome to put to that body her views about desirable changes in taxation arrangements. It is totally inappropriate to attempt to bring the operation of the taxation Act into the scope of this Bill. So the amendment is not acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; What the Minister has said is not substantiated by the fact that the Bill already specifically excludes the Department of Social Security. It does not exclude the Australian Taxation Office; it only excludes the Department of Social Security. If the Government says that it is beyond the capacity of this Bill to apply it to other departments, there would have been no need for the Government to have made the exclusions that it has made. The fact that it has excluded the Department of Social Security indicates very clearly that other departments are not excluded. Indeed, there is a direction that the Commonwealth departments are to abide by this Bill. It is not outside the scope of this Bill; it is very clearly within the scope of this Bill. I would like to hear the Minister's comment on that, because she has given an indication throughout the debate on this Bill that Government departments must abide by it. She is very concerned that Commonwealth departments should abide by the sex discrimination, marital and pregnancy clauses. Just because she is not particularly keen on my amendment, she says: ' It is outside the scope of the Bill'. It is not an excluded department, as is the Department of Social Security, and it is therefore within the scope of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may interrupt Senator Georges, it is one thing to accept the fact that under the Bill certain departments are excluded. It does not go on to change the law in respect of those departments by saying that the Department of Social Security will do various other things. But in this case the amendment would create a new provision in the income tax law. I put it that not only does it not follow that because we exclude some departments we can do what we like about any other departments and change the tax law in a Bill such as this, but also this is a Bill which, by its long title and other provisions, concerns the matter of discrimination. It does not change the tax laws of the Commonwealth. So far as the amendment is concerned, however sound the idea might be, I suggest it is beyond the scope of the Bill and is therefore out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I wish the Minister would further enlighten us on some of these matters, which she has not done so far. The objects of the Bill are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to give effect to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; to eliminate, so far as is possible, discrimination on the ground of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas of work, accommodation, education, provision of goods, facilities and services, the disposal of land, the activities of clubs, and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am the first to admit-the Minister has recognised and stated this-that the Bill does not attempt to implement all of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. But let us take the case of people who work. The people about whom Senator Walters is speaking are not parasites, they are workers. This Bill binds the Crown. It binds the Australian Taxation Office. It is a recognition, as it were, of the work that is done in the home that ought to be raised in the consciousness of the Parliament at this time-it is appropriate to do so-and it is for the Parliament to express its view as to how this legislation ought to operate. There are many ways in which proper recognition can be given to the women at home who are doing the most important job that a mother can do, and that is raising the family. Frankly it is appropriate that this matter be raised here. If this legislation goes through I am not too sure what effect it would have on the Taxation Office or whether we would perhaps be imposing a burden which we cannot impose under clause 57. Presumably the mover of the motion has checked out all of those matters. Nevertheless, if there is some problem in that regard obviously it can be sorted out between now and next February or March or whenever the House of Representatives pursues this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy that Senator Walters has raised this matter. There are additional ways in which mothers, who are doing this most important job, can be recognised in the financial sense, such as a homemaker's allowance, split incomes and a number of other ways. But at present it should be recognised that they are, as Senator Walters said, discriminated against. I congratulate her for raising the matter in the form that she has. </PARA>

If this Bill eliminates discrimination against women, I certainly feel that Senator Walters's amendment is a very good one. In fact, in my speech during the second reading debate I suggested that each partner of a two-income family should be allowed to earn $4, 000 tax free each year. That means that a two-income family would receive $8,000 tax free each year. I think that with the very small spouse rebate that is now being paid and with costs they are these days, it is really no wonder that married women feel they have to go out to work.

<PARA>These four Opposition amendments all relate to the same issue; that is, the very highly controversial use of the external affairs power in the Sex Discrimination Bill. We debated at some length the use of this power in a Bill which related to South West Tasmania. We discussed the rights and wrongs of the Commonwealth extending its power into areas which have traditionally been the responsibilities of State governments through the use of the external affairs power. Since that debate the High Court of Australia has ruled by a majority decision of four to three that the Commonwealth was entitled to use that power. I said in my speech on the Sex Discrimination Bill at the second reading stage that I was dismayed, altogether not surprised, by the judgment of the High Court for a number of reasons. I feared that the Government would not be able to resist the temptation to proceed with the Sex Discrimination Bill with a reliance on that power. I also feared that those who really just did not want any legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sex in this country would use that use of the external affairs power as a stick with which to beat this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said freely that there are a lot of good things in the Bill. However, we believe some improvements can be made. The legislative powers of the Commonwealth are already quite extensive in the areas that the Bill covers. They are outlined in clause 9. They are very numerous. The application of the external affairs power is in itself deficient. Because it depends on the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women it gives the Commonwealth the power, if it seeks to use it, only in matters which relate to discrimination against women. It does not extend to discrimination against men, which is a deficiency. One of the strengths of the Bill is that it is a Bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sex, whether it be discrimination against men or women. The fact, as it will emerge, that some parts of the Bill are limited because they apply only to women will, I think, affect public acceptance of the Bill. The very use of the external affairs power will certainly affect acceptance of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supported ratification of the Convention. It was our policy when in government to ratify and there were many statements on the record at the end of last year that the Government expected to ratify early this year. An election intervened and, as it happened, it was the Hawke Government, not the Fraser Government, which was in power when the Convention was ratified. We support the Convention and its ratification but we do not think it should be used in this way. We took this view in government but that in no way took away from our support for the principles of the Convention and our intention to implement the relevant areas in Australia. Also, we were aware when in government that a government could try to avail itself of the external affairs power in a number of ways, so it has long since been known that the potential was there. It was not until a government actually legislated and was tempted, as the Hawke Government was tempted in relation to South West Tasmania, and the matter was tested in the High Court of Australia that the issue was settled. It was not settled as clearly as some people seem to think. Some people think that because the High Court upheld the use of the external affairs power in the case of the Tasmanian dam, the Commonwealth Government can sign any international treaty and then take whatever powers it might assume flows from that. The actual decision was a little more complex than that. Nevertheless, it symbolised the transferring of a lot of power. The fact that the decision was as close as it was shows that it is an area of some disputation and doubt. That is a position of which we were aware when in Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would rather that sort of interjection were not made, Mr Chairman, with respect. The Fraser Government was well aware of the potential to use the external affairs power although it was not absolutely certain which way the High Court would rule. I expect that would depend on the circumstances of the case. In the case of South West Tasmania, the external affairs power was not the only power the Commonwealth relied on. It was a linkage of that power with other powers and other factors which led to the upholding of the legislation. The effect of our amendments will be to take out whatever reliance there is on the external affairs power. Nonetheless, there would be wide ranging powers for the Commonwealth to legislate. There would be areas in which it could go which some people might find obnoxious, but the Commonwealth would have that power without doubt. I think that it would also take away some of the fears and objections to the Bill which now centre on the Convention. We do not object to the Convention being in the Schedule and we will not oppose it, but there clearly is a potential for extension of this Bill through decisions of one kind or another. Senator Harradine pointed out those potentials in his speech during the second reading debate. That would be to the deteriment of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think that with a Bill like this, one is touching on some pretty basic feelings and attitudes in the community. The second reading debate illustrated that by the number of people who felt that they ought to speak and put their views on the record although they might have been reiterating views that had already been expressed. They were not speaking just for the purpose of expressing a point of view but because they thought it necessary to express their point of view. This is fairly typical of debate on Bills which are of a basic social nature. This Bill is of that nature. It will affect quite a few people. It is social in that it will affect people's attitudes towards other people, attitudes which may be based on their sex, marital status or state of pregnancy. As such, it is a Bill that will take a little acceptance as did, for example, the Family Law Act when it was passed. That was an Act that I supported at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> So I say to the Government that I move these amendments with the best intentions. I hope this Bill will be accepted and that in its implementation those who now fear it will see that they did not have so much to fear. There is, as the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs (Senator Ryan) would be well aware, very strong passions on the subject of the use of the external affairs powers on behalf of certain State governments. It is not necessary to use the power. The non-use of the powers would diminish the Bill very little, but I think that it would enhance the acceptance of the Bill very much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I support this measure. I do not intend to canvass what I said in the second reading debate. I believe that the Government is and will be in difficulties in regard to this provision, but it is the decision of the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs (Senator Ryan) and, frankly, the Minister may have to live with it. When I raised, in the Committee stage, the matter of the definition of 'marital status' she indicated that whilst I might be right in my views on the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, there was no intention on the part of the proposers of the Convention to include 'de facto spouse' as part of the definition of marital status and that the Parliament had power under the marriage power of the Constitution. It would be very odd indeed if that power were relied upon to place de facto relationships on the same level as a bona fide married relationship. For the information of the Committee I will read the comments that were made by the Department of Foreign Affairs when this matter was being discussed in the United Nations General Assembly committees and in the working party. In the supplementary brief of the Department of Foreign Affairs, UNGA 32/Item 85, entitled 'Draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women', the Department said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major difficulty, for Australia and perhaps for other states which are federations of one sort or another, is that many articles of the Convention require legislative guarantees of women's rights in areas of law which are the responsibility of the states. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Committee to consider that very carefully. It says that those who negotiated on behalf of Australia the draft of the United Nations Convention on which this Bill is based were told that the legislative guarantees were in areas of law which are the responsibilities of the States. Of course, that was before the Koowarta decision and the Tasmanian dams decision. The whole ball game has changed. I remember quite clearly, when I raised in New York some of the problems that I am or will be raising here, that I was told: 'Don't bother about that, Senator. The States will knock that off'. Of course, those who were negotiating that treaty believed that was the situation. The nature of negotiations that take place at this level is such that, in the words used to me : 'You can give way on certain things knowing full well that they will be knocked off in the States'. That was the understanding of the constitutional situation at the time. I think members of Parliament would also have had that understanding of the Constitution. They would understand that we did not have the power in many of the areas in which we say we have it now. We did not have the power to impose the view of the Commonwealth Parliament on the parliaments of the States by invoking international treaties of this character. Clearly, the Department of Foreign Affairs did not have that power, because this is its document. I will read it again and leave the matter at that:</PARA>

As the Chief Justice of the High Court has said, there is no area in everyday life, now that that decision has come down, to which those powers cannot be extended. Every area of everyday life of the people of Australia has been influenced by the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Government. It now has the power to take the rights that every Australian believes were those of the States. This decision was never put to the Australian people as it should have been. But we have learnt that that is not the way in which this Government acts. It is not something the Government believes the people should have any say about.</PARA></TALK.START>

He believes that the external affairs power has nothing to do with the States and is something that he should have. He believes that he should be able to say that the States will accept this. He has already said in his Boyer Lectures that the States are superfluous. He has already said that Canberra should have the ultimate power. We have learnt, in our State particularly, to regret his coming to power. He has attempted to push a republic through the back door.

My views on the use of the external affairs power are well known and unchanged. I made that very clear during the second reading debate speech which I made, actually not on this Bill but on its predecessor, on 8 November 1983. The reasons I gave then for my views still stand. I did not speak during the second reading stage of the substituted Bill. The substituted Bill is, of course, a much improved Bill with a lot more amendments and it picks up many of the civil liberties worries which the Opposition has. I believe the Opposition has a lot of very sound amendments, most of which I will not speak to today, if any, because I believe it is important that this Bill complete its passage through this chamber in this session and that it be available for the House of Representatives early in the new year. I want to say that in view of the fact that there was agreed action on the part of the Opposition, which I will comply with, I will be voting for the amendments. I am aware of their fate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The use of the external affairs power in the Sex Discrimination Bill is, as Senator Walters has said, clearly an obvious example of the ambitions of the Federal Labor Government to centralise all power in Canberra. It makes me ask myself what power the Government sees as being appropriate for the States and what power it sees as being appropriate for itself. I really cannot see that the Government draws any distinction between the two, and I am compelled to the view that a Federal Labor Government would take unto itself all power that is available to the States. This Bill is another example of the ambition of the Federal Government to impose its own, perhaps in some ways in the spirit of the Bill, myopic and jaundiced views upon the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This sort of use of the external affairs powers in this case, in my view, is the result of an assumption on the part of the Federal Government that whatever it can do constitutionally, it may do. The merits, the honesty, the fair dealings and the integrity of the legislation were not relevant to the Government's inquiries, as if the external affairs powers should be used in absolutely all cases. We see no spirit of State-Commonwealth co-operation or goodwill or of seeking to work in a way that will ensure that the structure and the fabric of federalism will continue. I see the use of the external affairs powers in this case as a corruption of the constitutional powers which were intended by the framers of the Constitution. I have no doubt that if the use of the external affairs powers in this sort of case, as in the case involving the South West Tasmanian dam, were put to the people by way of referendum, it would be overwhelmingly defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear that in the future the Commonwealth-I am sure this was the intention behind its advisory opinions proposal in the recently aborted referendum legislation-that the Government will seek to use the High Court of Australia as a way of by-passing the people through referenda and so distort the Constitution and ignore it in a way that was never intended, as though it and the views of the great majority of people are irrelevant. If the Federal Government really wanted to test people's views about the use of the external affairs power-it talks about consensus-I dare it to put the proposal to the people of Australia by way of a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the individual States have the capacity to introduce and implement legislation of this nature, as they have done on a number of occasions . I do not see this as legislation which necessarily has to be imposed from Canberra. I do not see this as legislation in the nature of the companies and securities exchange legislation. It is legislation that should be introduced by the separate States and implemented in such a way as not to cause contradictions or problems between the various States. The Federal Government is concerned that States such as Queensland and Tasmania will not introduce legislation. Surely that is something for the States to decide. At the appropriate time the people of a particular State will be able to pass judgment upon a State government that did not introduce legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is but one small step forward in the abuse and by-passing of the Constitution and the politicising in many respects of the High Court. I seriously question how long the fabric and structure of the Federal system as we know it will continue as long as there is abuse of the external affairs powers in this way. As Senator Walters quite clearly and in an articulate fashion put forward, the external affairs powers can be used in many ways. It really saddens me to see a Federal Government that has no concern for States rights or responsibilities but lunges forward, unfettered, with unbridled ambition to impose its view upon the people of Australia, disregarding and having no concern for the States. This just is another example of such a practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government obviously cannot accept the Opposition's amendment in this case . I think it is clear from Senator Martin's remarks that there is a clear policy division between the Government and the Opposition on the appropriateness of the use of the external affairs power. In the Government's view this is a legitimate use of the external affairs power. Of course, the Government is committed to the protection of all Australians, and in doing so will make use of the powers available to it. I should point out, though, that the Bill contains adequate protection for State laws and practices. Clauses 10 and 11 preserve State anti- discrimination laws. The Government leaves open the option for those States which currently do not have such laws to proceed to enact them. When a State does not enact such legislation the Bill will apply. The State laws are preserved by clause 40 for a period of two years, and thereafter regulations made under the legislation can continue this exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> State employees are not covered by this legislation. We are not seeking to make maximum use of the external affairs power and cover state employees in Queensland and Tasmania. At this stage we have left that area of employment to the States. It is quite wrong to try to characterise this piece of legislation, as Senator Crichton-Browne did, as very intrusive. It is true, as Senator Martin pointed out, that the Convention is concerned with discrimination against women and measures to attain equality for men and women. However, it is from women that the majority of complaints come. Accordingly, in the residual areas to which the application of the Convention is relevant, the Bill will have significant impact. It is our view that that significant impact would be seriously eroded should the Opposition's amendment be accepted. Consequently, we cannot accept it. </PARA>

Everyone on this side of the chamber is certainly in favour of overcoming all forms of discrimination against all people, including women. However, as a Tasmanian, I see very clearly the impact that an external affairs power can have on a sovereign community. I just wonder how far this can go, particularly if these external affairs powers can interfere with normal domestic and family arrangements.

If a situation can be defined as discriminatory within the terms of the legislation, a person receiving such treatment would be able to make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. If it cannot be so defined such a person would not. It is not clear from the example given by Senator Walters whether she is talking about discriminatory practices but, for instance, the Commonwealth Bank could not refuse to give a loan to a person simply on the basis that that person was or was not married. The normal kinds of considerations that banks take into account, such as a person's income, capacity to repay the loan and so on, would not be affected by the legislation. The legislation would say that it is unlawful to refuse a loan simply on the basis that a person is married or unmarried. It would not interfere with the normal criteria that a bank uses when assessing whether it will give a loan or, indeed, the terms and conditions on which the loan is given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I will be very brief in speaking to this clause because my next amendment is the most vital one. Clause 14 (3) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nothing in paragraph (1) (a) or (b) renders it unlawful for a person to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person's sex, in connection with employment to perform domestic duties on the premises on which the first-mentioned person resides. </PARA>
<PARA>I move:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Page 12, sub-clause 14 (3), line 12, after 'sex', insert 'or marital status '. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out very briefly that the exemption that is contained in that sub-clause is too narrow as it is confined to the acknowledgement of an entitlement to discriminate on the grounds of sex. I ask the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Ryan) whether the exemption would permit discrimination against a person living in an open de facto relationship, bearing in mind that this is in the nature of employing people to perform domestic duties and that this legislation, for the first time in the Commonwealth, is placing a de facto relationship on the same basis as a married relationship and forcing individuals to accept that situation. Clause 30 is headed 'Certain discrimination on ground of sex not unlawful' and states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . being a position in relation to which it is a genuine occupational qualification to be a person of the opposite sex to the sex of the other person.</PARA>
<PARA>How would the exemption in that clause relate to genuine occupational qualifications? How would the exemptions in clause 35, that is, the residential care of children provision, apply bearing in mind the situation that if one employs people to perform domestic duties in a house of which the owners of the house or of the institution have the responsibility of residential care of children? Finally, how do the exemptions operate in respect of clause 38 ' Educational institutions established for religious purposes'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill provides that it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of marital status in the case of employing a couple to do a range of domestic and perhaps maintenance duties in a home. It is the view of the Government that, if a person is applying for employment, his or her capacity to do the job in hand is what is relevant and not marital status. However, as Senator Harradine has pointed out, there are exemptions under clause 35. These apply where:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> the duties of the position involve the care of a child or children in the place where the child or children resides or reside;</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 35 (2) (b) grants an exemption where:</PARA>
<PARA> it is intended that the spouse of the occupant of the position would also occupy a position as an employee or contract worker of that employer or principal. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the area which is exempted. Otherwise marital status would be irrelevant in considering the application for employment in those sorts of domestic duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (5) Page 15, after sub-clause 22 (1), insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1A) Nothing in Division 1 or 2 renders it unlawful for a person-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to refuse to carry out or participate in carrying out the termination of a pregnancy;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to refuse to provide goods or make available facilities for the termination of a pregnancy; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to refuse to provide goods, services or facilities for or in relation to the performance of any medical or surgical procedure which that person genuinely believes to be morally wrong.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a most important-probably the most important-amendment I have. (Quorum formed) Clause 22 relates to the provision of goods, services and facilities. My amendment seeks to add a new sub-clause (1A). As I say, this is a most important measure. I have circularised honourable senators with a letter, dated 14 December, which indicates that there needs to be accepted in the Committee stage certain clarifying language, and that, as far as I am concerned, that needs to be accepted and is necessary to be accepted for me to honour my commitment both to anti-discrimination measures and to pro-life issues. I acknowledge that what the Government has said is that this measure is not designed to be able to be used for the pro-abortion lobby or for persons to make certain demands which would be conducive to the provision of abortion goods, services or facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Government has seen the logic in the argument that in some other areas-for example, in the United States of America-similar types of legislation have been invoked by the pro-abortion lobby to enforce its views on the community in general and on individuals in particular. As far as the provision of services is concerned, the Government, by its amendment in clause 32, has recognised that fact. Clause 32 is headed 'Services for members of one sex'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in Division 1 or 2 applies to or in relation to the provision of services the nature of which is such that that they can only be provided to members of one sex. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall come to that when we reach that clause. I believe that that is inadequate. But this Bill is aimed at eliminating discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy. As has been stated and, indeed, as has been accepted, in regard to the provision of services, facilities or goods to a woman who, for example, is seeking an abortion, that woman may argue that a doctor does not refuse a non-pregnant woman a service, such as curettage or any other gynaecological procedure or service. That is open to argument that, therefore, that a woman, if she is then denied an abortion, can claim discrimination. Obviously, the Government, as far as services are concerned, has accepted that situation; but it has not done so concerning the provision of goods or facilities. That is the purpose of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In circularising honourable senators I also circulated a document that had been prepared by an eminent lawyer and provided to me. That eminent lawyer has asked a number of questions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been claimed that the Government's proposed amendment to clause 32--</PARA>
<PARA>which I have read-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Bill will remove any possibility of the Bill facilitating abortion practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 provides that it is unlawful discrimination to refuse to provide ' goods' 'services' or 'facilities' on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy. The proposed amendment provides that it is not discriminatory to refuse to supply 'services' the nature of which are capable of only being supplied to members of one sex. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, clearly the amendment does not apply to exempt the supply of goods or facilities. A number of questions must be put to those who consider that the Bill does not in fact allow to occur in the future the situation which has been suggested. In my view the Bill should express in unequivocal language and make it clear that none of its provisions confer rights or impose obligations in relation to the termination of pregnancy. The Government has accepted the question of services. In respect of the provision of goods or facilities, these are the questions which have to be asked: Do the people who say there is nothing wrong with this Bill now concede that goods in clause 22 would include abortifacients such as prostaglandins used for mid-trimester abortions? If the answer to that question is yes, do they agree that it would be discriminatory on the grounds of sex or pregnancy to refuse to supply abortifacients to pregnant women who request them?</PARA>
<PARA> If the answer to the first question, that is, do they concede that goods in this clause would include abortifacients, is no-they have to answer either yes or no-on what basis is it claimed that abortifacients are not goods? If the answer to the second question is no, if they have said yes to the first question that they agree that abortifacients are goods, do they agree that it would be discriminatory on the grounds of sex and or pregnancy to refuse such abortifacients to a pregnant woman who requests them? If they say no, on what basis is it said that the refusal is not discriminatory? I have dealt with goods . Another question is: Do they concede that facilities would include the provision of equipment or the physical means for doing something, for example, the provision of suction curettage machines and instruments used in abortions as well as operating theatre availability for the purpose of abortions? If they answer yes to that question-they must answer yes to that question-do they agree that it would be discriminatory on the grounds of sex and/or pregnancy to refuse to make such facilities available for a pregnant woman who requests them? If the answer to that question is no, on what basis is it said that the refusal is not discriminatory? It may be suggested that the refusal to provide such goods or facilities may be based on the grounds of conscience or law. On what clause or legal decision is this suggestion based? It may be said that the law is the law; it is there. I want to know which law. What is the law to which those people refer? That would promote a very interesting debate on various judgments that have been made in respect of these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The same question could be raised about the provision of goods. On what basis can a person claim a conscientious objection under this Bill? A number of other matters relating to this issue can be raised at a subsequent stage, but those are the questions that must be answered. If they are not properly answered, why can we not in precise language adopt an amendment such as mine, which would exclude the possibility of this measure being used for purposes for which it was not presumably designed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now dealing with what has been the greatest red herring in this whole debate. It was never the intention or a possibility under the legislation as it was drafted that it could affect in any way current laws regarding access to abortion or to sterilisation operations or to the purchase of abortifacients from pharmacies. It was clear from the definition of discrimination in the Bill that the Bill is concerned with less favourable treatment to persons on the grounds of their sex, marital status or pregnancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it was clear from the start that the Bill could cover only services or goods which in their nature could be available to both sexes. One cannot say that it is discriminatory to refuse a man an abortion since in the nature of that service it is not able to be offered to a man. We are being involved in a very confusing red herring which, of course, has gone on to raise some genuine anxieties in the community. However, in order to clarify what was already in the Bill, an amendment to clause 32 was incorporated which clarifies that the Bill does not apply to services the nature of which is that they can be provided only to people of one sex. I should make it clear, because there has been some discussion about this, that sterilisation is a procedure the nature of which can apply only to one sex. Although it is possible for males and females to have sterilisation procedures, those procedures are, of course, entirely different. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about goods and facilities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to goods and facilities. Facilities are already covered because clause 32 uses the words 'or in relation to the provision of services the nature of which is such that they can only be provided to members of one sex'. So if the concern is that abortion be clearly excluded and facilities which could be used for an abortion procedure also be excluded, those words cover that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For goods, it is a separate question. For goods-abortifacients is the example used by Senator Harradine-the point is that if people do not wish to sell such goods they do not sell them. Abortifacients are goods. A pharmacist has the choice of not stocking them at all or, when selling them, he can warn people and , indeed, should warn customers of the dangers involved in their usage. There is no way the criterion of pregnant or non-pregnant in relation to the customer seeking to purchase the abortifacient could be incorporated in this legislation in the way that Senator Harradine requires. If a pharmacist sells an abortifacient he has no way of knowing who will use it. He could sell it to a man who might then give it to a woman who might wish to use it. We cannot contain what would happen to that good once it was sold by seeking a change to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple solution is that, if a pharmacist does not wish to stock such goods, there is no obligation on the pharmacist to stock them at all. If a pharmacist refused to stock those drugs, the pharmacist would not commit an act of discrimination under the legislation. The essence of discrimination in clause 5 of the Bill is less favourable treatment on the ground of the sex of a person. A pharmacist who does not stock particular goods is not in a position to supply them to any person, so the sex or marital status of the customer is irrelevant. A further consideration in the refusal by the pharmacist to stock goods could be because of his concern about the nature of the goods and not about the sex of any potential customer. I hope I have clarified that. Senator Harradine raised concerns about the sale of abortifacients by pharmacists. </PARA>

Such refusal-it could be on the grounds of his moral objection to them-would not constitute discrimination under the Bill. Services and facilities are covered in clause 32 which clarifies that the Bill does not cover services or facilities to or in relation to such services which, in their nature, can only be delivered to one sex. Clearly there are no grounds on which the Government can accept this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, let us talk about doctors in country towns if Senator Tate is interested in the question of conscientious objection. If a doctor has a conscientious objection to the provision of an IUD and if he has a conscientious objection, say, to the provision of contraceptives to a single person, then where does he stand under this legislation? That is the question that one has to ask, and it is not answered. In fact, the other aspect has not been answered as well. Senator Ryan says that this point is a red herring and then she says that the Bill is not designed to alter the current laws on access to abortion. What are the current laws? I would be interested to hear from Senator Ryan what are the current laws in respect of access to abortion.</PARA></TALK.START>

If neither the Minister nor the Government or any member of it will not support clarifying language, will she give an assurance that nothing in this clause would make it unlawful for a person to refuse to carry out or participate in carrying out the termination of a pregnancy, or to refuse to provide goods or make facilities available for the termination of pregnancy, or to refuse to provide goods, services or facilities for the performance of surgical or medical procedures such as sterilisation, which many people regard as morally wrong? I ask that because the Minister referred to clause 32, and I ask it notwithstanding what is contained in that clause. It is not enough to concede that interpretations are arguable or not arguable; what the Committee needs and certainly what is important for the people of Australia and those who are likely to be affected is an assurance as to how the clause will operate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I have been listening carefully to the debate as it has progressed and to the responses of the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, Senator Ryan, to Senator Harradine. The Opposition will support Senator Harradine on this amendment. There are some important issues not covered by the Sex Discrimination Bill, although it might have been meant to cover them. I accept Senator Harradine's contention that clause 32 does not cover all the eventualities he outlined, particularly contraception. Some people-doctors and pharmacists-have a moral objection, for example, to providing the contraceptive pill or whatever to single people. Even if that is not the general community attitude, there are some people who hold that view very firmly and they hold it for moral reasons. Senator Harradine made the point and I do not think the Bill meets that point. There would be a division of views in the Senate on the subject of termination of pregnancy. But I think there would be very little dispute as to whether somebody had the right-let us say a doctor-to refuse to carry out an abortion if the doctor had a moral objection to it. I am sure there would not be any objection to the principle that a nurse who had the same moral objection to abortion refused to participate in or be a part of that procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So whatever our individual views are on the subject of whether abortion should be illegal, I would expect virtual unanimity-I think it was something that Senator Ryan tried to move towards in the Bill-on the fact that there are a large number of people in our community who believe abortion is morally wrong. I am not one of them, but I respect the point of view, and I respect the grounds on which that view is held. Nevertheless, I doubt that anyone who is of my persuasion-I have outlined in the Senate on previous times that I do not hold the same moral objection to abortion-would disagree with Senator Harradine's amendment; that is, that those who do hold that moral view have a right not to be forced, by the force of any law relating to discrimination, actually to participate in something which morally is utterly unacceptable to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be extremely brief. Like Senator Martin, I too have listened very carefully to this debate because it is one which particularly interests me. I think my views on abortion are fairly well known. I have certainly always made them clear to the women's movement in South Australia. I am totally opposed to abortion as a form of contraception, unlike Senator Martin, who appears not to share the belief that abortion under any circumstances is morally wrong. However, having said that, I would like to diverge from Senator Martin's other point; that is, I am totally convinced by the Minister's statement that the amendments to clause 32 will satisfy the objections that Senator Harradine put forward in his amendment. It is therefore not the intention of my Party-notwithstanding my views, but because I accept what Senator Ryan has said-to support Senator Harradine's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that I will not support the further clarification in wording sought by Senator Harradine. I will explain the basis for that. The fact is I believe that those who are listening to this debate ought to understand what is going on. The Government laid open the Bill for public discussion and comment over the winter months. At the end of that period of discussion many representations were made, including those by Senator Harradine and other groups, concerning the question of the possible effect of the Bill in relation to procedures for the termination of pregnancy, and I shared some of those concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst not always agreeing with the particular tactics or political strategies of the right to life movement in Australia, I am a member of the Tasmanian Right to Life Association and I consulted with Margaret Tighe, who is well known to members of the Federal Parliament in relation to her championing of this particular social issue. Indeed, I know, as Chairman of the Caucus legal committee, that during the final discussion of the representations received over the winter a declaratory clarifying clause was inserted into the Bill to become, I think it was then, clause 20 (1A) in order to clarify and declare the situation to make it clear what was already clear, that the Bill did not provide for a situation where it would be unlawful to refuse to provide an abortion to a woman who requested it. That issue is decided on other grounds in relation to other values and laws. This particular Bill had no particular effect on that question. I was nevertheless pleased to see that the Government made yet another more clear statement of that point in what is now clause 32 of the Bill to say that in relation to the whole of Divisions 1 and 2 nothing:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . applies to or in relation to the provision of services the nature of which is such that they can only be provided to members of one sex. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed that particular form of language has been the subject of legal advice to the Right to Life Association and Mrs Margaret Tighe has authorised me to table, if that is what honourable senators wish, the legal advice by a leading member of the Melbourne Bar which that particular Association obtained, and which has satisfied itself that indeed this declaratory clarifying section within the Bill does make it quite clear that the Bill does not render the refusal to perform an abortion an unlawful act. Indeed the opinion which has been provided is very striking not only for its sympathetic concern with the issues raised but also for its absolute rejection of the very strange interpretation which has been offered by those who have this concern as a deep moral and conscientious question. Without going through the actual legal steps, step by step-as I say, I am prepared to table the opinion-counsel says at paragraph 2.8:</PARA>
<PARA> I have read a number of articles which fear discrimination might arise in the way that is set out in some of the arguments by Senator Harradine and others-but I find their reasoning quite unconvincing. </PARA>

I just indicate that for the benefit of the Committee. Therefore I find it quite unnecessary further to concede to the arousing of fears and misgivings, which Senator Harradine's further amendment I believe sets out to achieve. I believe that the Bill, as it stands, does not in any way permit it to be said that the refusal to provide an abortion to a woman is rendered unlawful by the Bill. I find that the continual attempt to embarrass the Government, to try to put the Government on the defensive and to embarrass Senator Ryan in particular, is a political exercise rather than one that is concerned with the very real issue of whether the Bill does facilitate the termination of pregnancies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, Senator Tate accepted the original Bill when it came into the chamber. I am talking about the original Bill which went through Caucus. He accepted that, and furthermore he claimed that persons were concerned about that legislation and their concerns have now been understood and recognised, even by the opinion which in fact is outdated. However, what did Senator Tate do? As far back as 27 October an article headed 'Truth lost in hysteria, says Senator' stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The distortion of the Sex Discrimination Bill by some interest groups had contributed to an hysterical atmosphere in which the truth was finding it hard to be heard, Senator Michael Tate said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate . . . made the comment after supporting the bill in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The bill makes no impact on the question of abortion in Australia whatsoever,' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>According to the report, Senator Tate went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 'To make this division crystal clear a declaration has been inserted in the bill stating that nothing in section 20 applies to services, the nature of which is such that they can only be provided to members of one sex.'</PARA>
<PARA>I was the one who raised this issue in the first place. I was aware of the fact that it had been used in the United States of America for this purpose. My contacts in America, of whom I have a large number in the pro-life field, had warned of this possibility because the equal rights amendment in the United States had been similarly used. I raised this matter by writing to every senator in this place, including Senator Tate. What Senator Tate is suggesting now is that he and Margaret Tighe got into the act. Margaret Tighe did not even get into the act until I had written to honourable senators. She apparently came up here to lobby and then settled for an arrangement with Senator Tate. That, by definition, even the Government recognised was inadequate because it left hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory, including the Calvary Hospital, open to charges of discrimination under this legislation. Quite clearly, the limiting of the exclusion, such as it is, to the then section 20, was not sufficient. The Government has recognised that because it has in fact amended the legislation, after being pressed by me and others, by inserting new clause 32 which seeks to provide an exclusion for members of one sex in respect of services referred to in Divisions 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate says it was his view-presumably he maintains it is still his view- that this issue of abortion is one of the matters that, to use his words, 'are determined in accordance with other values and under particular laws'. He has not answered the questions that have been prepared by legal counsel. He has not answered the questions that I placed before the Senate previously. It is quite clear that this legislation can be used by a person to claim, on the grounds of sex or pregnancy, that he or she has been discriminated against by the refusal to provide certain goods, facilities and services, the nature of which is such that their supply would contravene the conscientious objection of the providers. I know that this gets on to the question of the conscientious clause which I will propose later on and which does not deal precisely with the clause that is currently before us. However, the questions which have been raised, and which have remained unanswered by either Senator Ryan or Senator Tate, are relevant to that clause which we will deal with later. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

Is it reasonable to suggest, in the words of Dame Leonie, that women who wanted to raise a family could not then expect to reach the highest rungs of the academic ladder?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The views of Dame Leonie Kramer, as they were reported in the media , have been drawn to my attention.

<PARA> The implications of Dame Leonie Kramer's remarks are quite disturbing. If she believes that there is not any structural discrimination against women academics , one must infer from her expressing that view that she also believes that the current situation in which only 2 per cent of professors are women reflects the real capacity of women. That is certainly not my view. It is not the view of any organisation representing women academics, be it the Australian Federation of University Women or the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, or any other organisation that has high membership of university women. It is the view of those organisations that in the past a great deal of direct and indirect discrimination has prevented women of very high qualifications of outstanding scholarship and teaching experience from receiving promotion to the most senior levels within the academic hierarchy. I refer honourable senators to a study made of women within universities called 'Why so few' which was published last year and which documents very convincingly the kinds of employment policies, promotional policies and circumstances that have prevented very able women from being made professors.

Why now, only nine months after being elected and nine months after making that scathing attack on Mr Fraser for his political expediency in calling an early election, is the Prime Minister speculating on calling an early election, 16 months before it is due? Does not the Prime Minister's claim of a recalcitrant Senate reek of fraud and deception, given that out of the 169 pieces of legislation presented to the Senate all but four have been passed or remain intact to be passed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I concede in part Senator Chipp's observation that the Senate, except with particular Bills, has not been a highly recalcitrant Senate. I do not know, but it is just possible that the Prime Minister might have speculated about an early election in order to help the economic recovery even further, because speculation about an early election carries with it speculation about the prospect of the alternative government succeeding in that election. That would be a great stimulus to the people of Australia to follow the Government's economic policies which are leading to such success. Insofar as I am unable to answer parts of the question, I will address them to the Prime Minister and obtain an answer.</PARA>

I am advised that the reference to 450m barrels is not soundly based and is not even close to an accurate figure. The proven reserves in that entire area amount to about 50m barrels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The correct position is that before anyone could request exemption from tax liability under section 3 (12) of the present Act, that person would have to be in receipt of an assessment or make such a request during the subsequent objection period. That is in conflict, of course, with the reason that Senator Harradine gave on Wednesday, when he voted against precisely the same proposition which he had voted for last year. Senator Harradine claimed, and repeated yesterday, that he voted in the way he did because of the retrospective effect. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the omission of section 3 (12) has a retrospective effect in that taxpayers who would be entitled to relief under that sub-section and who have requested that it be applied by the Commissioner of Taxation will now have that right removed and face recoupment tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA>As a matter of law, pursuant to section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act, Senator Harradine is wrong. Anybody who made such a request would be exempt from liability whether section 3 (12) remained in the existing Act or not. In other words, there is absolutely no substance in the reason which Senator Harradine gave for reversing his vote and no substance in the claim he made yesterday that he had been misrepresented on this issue by the Press. Senator Harradine could have got that information at any time before Wednesday by means of a simple telephone call to the Australian Taxation Office. There is one other matter I wish to raise before completing the answer. I note that on Wednesday last Senator Harradine said:</PARA>

I think I am correct in saying that the projected capacity now is of the order of 6 million tonnes a year. There have already been sizable reductions in the work force.

<PARA> I am advised that the grants for the study of employer attitudes to employing women apprentices in traditionally male trades, referred to by the honourable senator, were approved by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and funded through the Bureau of Labour Market Research. The BLMR exercise is being undertaken because there are no Australian studies of employers' attitudes towards women apprentices in non-traditional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the attitude of employers towards female apprentices is only one of the factors that has limited the number of female apprentices in training today. Other important factors which influence female participation in the trades include:</PARA>
<PARA> lack of awareness by females of the career and educational opportunities associated with the trades. </PARA>
<PARA> misconceptions of the working environment which is traditionally male-dominated . </PARA>
<PARA> community prejudices, family and peer pressures against female participation in the trades. </PARA>
<PARA> secondary education not oriented for entry into the trades. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as Government action is concerned, in an attempt to overcome some of the barriers related to the willingness of females to participate in the trades and to demonstrate to employers that females have the ability to undertake trade work, Government labour force programs in the trade area have as part of their objective the provision of employment and training opportunities for females. </PARA>
<PARA> Two such schemes are the Group Apprenticeship Scheme and the Government's recent initiative to fund an additional 3,000 trade-based pre-employment course places in TAFE in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> In negotiating with State and Territory Governments the range and levels of Federal Government assistance under these programs, the Government actively seeks to maximise opportunities for females. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the National Economic Summit Conference agreed that the move towards greater equality and independence for women should be encouraged and that there should be equal access to job creation programs, to employment, training, retraining and education, and measures designed to break down occupational segregation and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sex Discrimination Bill which has recently been debated in the Senate will render discrimination against women in the spheres of education, training and employment unlawful. The Affirmative Action Green Paper will include information to assist employers in the formulation of equal employment policies within their organisations and enterprises. The National Labour Consultative Council has previously published ''Guidelines for Employers on Equal Employment Opportunities for Women'', which provides some advice for employers intending to implement such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Women's Bureau in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has produced several videos promoting career opportunities for women in a range of non-traditional occupations. The most recent video entitled ''Technically Speaking'' has been produced in two parts, one of which is intended for viewing by employers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 December 1983 Senator Chaney asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations a question without notice concerning youth unemployment. The question referred to a report by the Bureau of Labour Market Research (BLMR) entitled ''Youth Wages, Employment and the Labour Force''.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following additional information relating to the BLMR report:</PARA>
<PARA> This report indicated that there was a relationship between youth wages and youth unemployment. However, although the direction of the relationship is quite clear, the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> The report emphasises that a major factor contributing to high youth unemployment has been the slow growth of economic activity since the early 1970s . Recruitment practices and changes in industrial structure have also been important contributory factors. </PARA>
<PARA> The BLMR is currently considering commissioning additional studies to corroborate its findings. </PARA>
<PARA>RECORD OF GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Possible question</PARA>
<PARA> Who was responsible for the publication 'Record of Government'? How much did it cost? To whom was it distributed? Is it proposed to produce further editions of this publication?</PARA>
<PARA>Suggested answer</PARA>
<PARA> The 'Record of Government' was produced by the ministerial media group. It describes the achievements of the Government between March and September 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> 10,000 copies of the publication were printed and were widely distributed to the media, business organisations, trade unions and libraries. The cost of printing it was $11,250, which was met by my department. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to revise the publication regularly, and responsibility for this will rest with the National Media Liaison Service, which will also meet the cost of printing and distribution of future issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid was critical of this publication in a question to Senator Button on 30 November 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Costs of printing and distributing the first edition of the 'Record' were met by the Department because the Ministerial Media Group has no funds for such activities. In future, all costs will be met by NMLS. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that future editions be tabled in the Parliament before distribution to the media and non-government organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 November 1983 (Hansard, page 2904) Senator Archer asked Senator Button, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the Louisiana Exhibition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not provide any funds in this year's Budget for Australia to participate in this exposition and accordingly there is no development to report in regard to this project. </PARA>
<PARA>EXECUTION OF CRIMINALS IN INDONESIA</PARA>
<PARA> On 2 December 1983 Senator Missen asked a question concerning the killing of criminals and suspected criminals in Indonesia by mysterious death squads. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer: I am aware of reports of a major campaign against crime in Indonesia and that it is alleged that the campaign is officially condoned. According to some estimates, between 2 ,000 and 3,000 people involved or alleged to have been involved in criminal activities have been shot without trial by so-called ''death-squads''. </PARA>
<PARA> The campaign is alleged to have started in Yogyakarta in May and subsequently extended to other important urban areas in Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan. </PARA>
<PARA> On my instructions, the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta made representations about the allegations to the Indonesian Government on 16 August. The issue has also been raised on a number of occasions with Indonesian officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is concerned about outbreaks of lawlessness but could not and would not condone summary executions which would be in clear contravention of the fundamental human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has consistently taken the view that Australia has a strong interest in seeing internationally accepted human rights observed and respected, and believes that in all situations the due process of law should be followed. Our representations to the Indonesian authorities are in keeping with this interest. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Question 1: What role will the United Nations play in the Act?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer 1: The United Nations will have observers present. Australia has been reporting to the United Nations since the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth in 1955 concerning its responsibility to create conditions under which the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands will be able to determine freely their own future in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV) as well as other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Question 2: What method will be used to ensure that the result is a true reflection of the wishes of the people, bearing in mind that there are three options from which they will have to choose?</PARA>
<PARA> Question 3: What system of voting will be used?</PARA>
<PARA> Question 4: Will Mr John Clunies-Ross and his family be excluded from voting?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer 2, 3 and 4: These matters are still being examined in conjunction with the United Nations, the Cocos Malay people and the Australian Electoral Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Question 5: When will the Act of Self Determination take place?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer 5: It is expected that the Act will take place in the first half of 1984 . </PARA>
<PARA> Question 6: Does the Government plan to allocate funds to promote the acceptance of any of the three proposals. If so, which one?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer 6: No. The Government's concern is to ensure the Cocos people fully understand the options put to them, and the procedures for voting. </PARA>

Only those who are in receipt of an assessment can make that request. The interpretation of the Acts Interpretation Act given to me by an officer of the Australian Taxation Office-I believe it was also given to Senator Harradine-is completely in conflict with what he has said. Today he claimed that the people to whom the Commissioner of Taxation applied section 3 (12) will be protected. If I understood him correctly those who have requested the Commissioner to apply the exemption, as distinct from it having been applied, will have that protection removed.

So in no way can it be said that it is a matter of urgency that this Bill be dealt with by the Senate. In fact, the only result of the Senate passing this Bill will be that the Bill will be in limbo between the Senate and the House of Representatives for several months before it is dealt with by the House of Representatives, and, perhaps, dealt with in a rather peremptory way by that chamber if this is any example of the Government's attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We dispute the assertion that this is an urgent Bill. We do not believe that it is urgent, for the reason that I have indicated. What is urgent is that the inconvenience of the Bill should be removed from honourable senators opposite, because the Bill has been the subject of a great number of representations from around Australia and I have little doubt that Government senators want to see the matter off their agenda before they go away for Christmas. I suspect that that is the reality that lies behind the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have at all times made it clear to the Government, and I have had a number of discussions with the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that we could not agree to the guillotining of the Sex Discrimination Bill because we regard the legislation as of considerable social significance and we think that it is essential that there be full and fair opportunity for debate. We have a Bill which the Government itself has amended over 50 times. It has introduced over 50 amendments. There are over 30 amendments being put by the Opposition. A small number of those have been dealt with. We are now in a situation in which we have to debate the remaining 27 amendments which have been put forward by the Opposition, by the Australian Democrats and by Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that there is no urgency about the Bill. We are being given a little over three hours in which to deal with 27 amendments. That is about eight minutes per amendment. Even if there is some grouping of amendments, there will be very little opportunity for a substantial debate on issues of some moment. We are still to debate amendments to the harassment provisions and to the education provisions, and amendments to the administrative arrangements which are being put in place on such questions as the rights of people to have a lawyer, the extent to which schools are to be exempt, and the extent to which there should be a conscience provision in the Bill. We face a very difficult task in dealing with what are complex amendments on a matter of very wide public interest within the sort of time frame which has been laid down by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand the Government wanting to clear its legislative program and a lack of concern because it has given the matter internal consideration. No doubt members of the Government believe that the legislation is in proper form and are asking themselves why they should be worried about further parliamentary time. One can understand that. One can understand the Manager of Government Business, Senator Grimes, saying: 'After all, the Bill has already had 13 1/2 hours'. The fact is that most of that time has been taken up in second reading debate. We have had very limited time in Committee. The fact is that this is a Bill which has excited great public comment and on which serious issues of principle have been raised. The surprising thing is not the Government's attitude. Governments in the past have moved the guillotine. I was once a Whip, and I managed to get a few Government senators at that time to support the guillotine. I concede that, although I would mention that Senator Sir John Carrick, when Leader of the Government in the Senate, never once, I think--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once; used once the procedure that is now before us. But the surprise card in this pack is not Senator Grimes. It is my friend Senator Chipp, because Senator Chipp said to the Australian people that one of the great advantages of electing Australian Democrats to this place is that there would be no more gags and no more guillotines. That is a view which I have often heard repeated in this place, and I am sure that Senator Chipp and the Democrats remember that famous statement of Senator Chipp's. I guess that it goes to show that what a politician says in one circumstance will not necessarily be applicable to another circumstance in which he finds himself. The limitations which are being placed on this debate are being placed on it by the Government, and they are also being placed on it by the Australian Democrats, who indicated that under them, that would not occur. Obviously, the people of Australia cannot rely on the Democrats to ensure that there is an opportunity for full and fair debate in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I may say something which I hope will strike a wider chord of agreement in the Committee, because whilst I am sure that Opposition senators agree with what I am about to say, it is clear that neither the Government senators nor the Democrats agree with it. I believe that there is no point-no doubt we shall hear from the Democrats-in debating for the next hour the issues which are before us now. I think the time that is available to us should certainly be spent on the Committee stage of the sex discrimination legislation. I would like to make it clear that we have agreed to forgo the lunch break and we have agreed to the shorter Question Time because it is the view of the Opposition that there should be the maximum opportunity to consider the issues of principle which have been raised and, importantly, to vote on the clauses as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to acknowledge that in the representations that I made to the Government there has been a response in that the form of guillotine which has been put down does break up the time and should give us some hope that the actual amendments which are being put forward can be put to a vote. I think it is important that that should be so. The Opposition will do its best to ensure that the proceedings of the Committee operate in a way which will enable that to happen. I acknowledge that one virtue in the form of guillotine which has been put down by the Government. A guillotine in gross would have had the effect whereby all divisions might have been taken in one vote and those honourable senators who might have wished to vary their position on the different aspects of this legislation would have been denied that important right. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to express the concern of the Opposition that, in a situation which is devoid of real urgency, in a situation where the Bill cannot in fact be dealt with totally by the Parliament until well into next year, the Government has seen fit to put this limitation on the time which is available for debate. I wish, in the firmest possible terms, to make known the total objection of the Opposition to the procedure which is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before Question Time Senator Tate was talking about the fact that he belonged to the Right To Life Association in Tasmania and in the same breath was talking about Mrs Tighe. They belong to different organisations altogether. I am not sure whether Senator Tate is aware of that. The Right To Life Association in Tasmania has nothing to do with Mrs Tighe's organisation in Victoria. He may not be aware of that but that is a fact . He came into this place as a lawyer and quoted one other legal opinion brought to him by Mrs Tighe. There would not be another lawyer in this place who would be prepared to quote just one lawyer and say that that is fact. Legal opinions vary considerably on this issue; that is fact. I am not saying which side is correct. I am saying that legal opinions vary considerably on this issue and that is fact. It shows the difficulty of what this Sex Discrimination Bill is trying to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take at face value Senator Ryan's statement that it was never the intention of the legislation to interfere with the existing situation. I do not believe it was the intention, but it certainly forced the Government into amending various areas. Indeed, this Government has been forced by the Opposition to accept about 80 amendments. The Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Ryan) promised me that she would get me the information I sought before the debate finished and I hope she is in the process of doing so. I ask her if she will get me the information I sought relating to clause 3 of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This points out a particular difficulty. If, as the Minister said, she has no intentions of interfering with the present situation regarding abortion, why does she not accept the amendments of Senator Harradine? What harm would it do for the Government to accept Senator Harradine's amendments? Indeed, if she believes that there is an area of disputation between lawyers on this issue- Senator Tate has now indicated by a nod of his head that there is-if indeed its intention is honourable and is not to interfere with the abortion situation as it stands, why does the Government not accept the amendments put by Senator Harradine?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not. What happened was this. I will go through the history of the presentation of this matter to the Parliament. When the matter was a private member's Bill introduced into the Senate by Senator Susan Ryan, Caucus did not approve the clause by clause form of the Bill. What Caucus does in relation to a private member's Bill is give permission for the Caucus member to introduce it into the chamber. In no sense does that bind Caucus members. Senator Ryan then became Minister for Education and Youth Affairs within the Government and the Government had a Bill drafted, substantially along the lines of Senator Ryan's private member's Bill. That was introduced into the Caucus earlier this year. There was widespread discussion in Caucus and Caucus committees and, in the midst of that Caucus debate, I was responsible for moving an amendment which effectively permits the armed services to refuse to allow women to serve in combat zones. That is the famous combat related duties clause. I was very conscious of the various ramifications of this Bill and took steps to ensure, as was my right as a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, that the Bill did not in that particular instance provide for women to serve in combat zones. That was my point of view and it was carried in Caucus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also have a point of view that the Bill should not in any way provide any justification for the provision of abortion services. I believed in absolute good faith and on a fair reading of the Bill that it did not in any way confer such a right on a person to insist on the provision of termination of pregnancy services. That was my legal opinion. It happened to be shared by the Government after a thorough investigation of the matter. It was the opinion of the Attorney -General (Senator Gareth Evans) as provided to the Caucus committee. Therefore I did not see an absolute need for any clause within the Bill to state, declare or clarify that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I was aware of the United States of America court decisions to which Senator Harradine referred. I have done my damnednest to get hold of the actual reports of those cases from the various United States jurisdictions. It has proved incredibly difficult, in fact impossible, for either the library of the High Court of Australia or the Parliamentary Library to provide me with copies of the actual reports. Nevertheless, I accepted the precis of them which has been made available in various Australian and United States publications. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of that, within the Caucus committee, I carried out several negotiations which led to that committee, under my chairmanship, accepting a formula of words to clarify to declare the situation as those of us, who in good faith, believe it to be in any case. That clause emerged as clause 20 (1A) of the Bill when it was brought into this chamber for debate earlier this session. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made a further clarification in moving that clause into another section so that it embraces a wider range of sections throughout Divisions 1 or 2. I recall that, on the night that the Caucus legal committee made that decision, I saw Senator Harradine and informed him of it as part of the spirit of negotiation and of keeping him informed and in trying to act in a reasonably civilised manner. Simply because I could not agree with his further remaining misgivings about the adequacy of that legal procedure, I was pilloried in the Tasmanian Press for being a lackey of the Minister, Senator Ryan, when all that there was was a decent difference of opinion as to the legal expression of a common concern. I think that if it were put on that basis it would help to moderate a lot of the argument that has been rather heatedly exchanged around the chamber so far. The concern is held in common. The concern is acknowledged by the Government. It has found its legal expression in that clause which I judge to be adequate. Others may not judge it to be adequate. I believe there is good faith on both sides. My view therefore remains that no further clarification or declaration is required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The position is clear. Senator Tate, prior to chairing the Caucus legal committee, had the benefit of a letter from me which had been distributed to all honourable senators. For him now to suggest that in some way this had emerged from him and that he, in some way, is the sole judge of what ought to go into this legislation is ludicrous. For him to say that just because I differed with his view on this matter I pilloried him in the Press as being a lackey of the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs (Senator Ryan) is also untrue. I said that he was a lackey of the Minister over his support of the Government breaking the nexus of educational funding for non- government schools. That is what I said. I said that only after some of us had expressed concern about this abortion issue and Senator Tate had made a quite critical accusation that we were being hysterical. He was the first to raise the matter in the Press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that time is on the wing. I say simply to Senator Tate and to the Minister that if there is doubt about these matters, if some legal opinion says one thing and another legal opinion says another-I have quoted from that legal opinion and answers have not been given-what is wrong with accepting the clarifying language that is contained in the provisions that I have put forward? What is wrong with that? Finally, am I to understand from the Minister that my amendments are not needed because my concerns as expressed in the amendments are unfounded? Am I to understand that?</PARA>

However, he raised in passing the situation of a pharmacist who would sell contraceptives but choose not to sell them to a single person. That situation is covered in the Bill.

<PARA>These amendments refer to the sexual harassment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Bill. I reassure Senator Walters that in moving any of my amendments I intend to take the minimum time that I think is necessary to state the Opposition's case and to avoid unnecessary elaboration. I am sure that is the spirit of all speakers today. Amendment No. (7) seeks to amend clause 28 (3) by substituting a new sub-clause (3) to provide that a person would be guilty of sexual harassment of someone else in the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the first-mentioned person makes a sexual advance, or a request for sexual favours, to the other person, or engages in other conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the other person;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the other person-</PARA>

<PARA> takes reasonable steps to communicate to the first-mentioned person that the advance, request or conduct is unwelcome; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) the first-mentioned person-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the alleged harassor-</PARA>
<PARA> makes it reasonably appear to the other person that a rejection of the advance, a refusal of the request or the taking objection to the conduct would disadvantage the other person-</PARA>

<PARA> in any way in connection with the other person's employment or work or possible employment or possible work; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) as a result of the other person's-</PARA>
<PARA>the harassee's-</PARA>
<PARA> rejection of the advance, refusal of the request or taking of objection to the conduct, the other person is disadvantaged in any  way in connection with the other person's . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, Senator Ryan, knows what I mean, and I am sure the Committee knows. We seek to put a provision here that it should be clear that the harassment, whatever form it takes-whether it is a request for sexual favours or whatever, but something of a sexual nature-is not welcome. I know we get into the difficult situation where some would say it could be alleged that sometimes through fright or fear, a young woman might just freeze, emotionally, and not know how to handle the situation, particularly if the person doing the harassing is someone who is older, more senior or perhaps the boss. Therefore the woman involved might appear to encourage the person making the sexual advance by, say, smiling, which is something that people do on occasion in nervous fright-it is possible-or perhaps try to ignore the problem, hoping it will go away. I know that that is one argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative, where that distaste for the sexual advance, or the annoyance or fear that may be felt by that person in relation to the sexual advance, is not expressed in any way, could well lead to the classic defence used down through the ages: 'But I thought she liked it'. I think there is a grey area. It is probably difficult for certain men on occasions, unless they are given an indication, to realise that they are not being encouraged. It is difficult for some men, even if someone hits them on the head with a lump of wood, to be discouraged. But that is an aside; it has nothing to do really with sexual harassment. There could genuinely be a man who is attracted to someone with whom he works, someone who may be junior to him, who makes a sexual advance and believes that he has been encouraged. He does not make the sexual advance with menace or with the thought that 'I will use my position of superiority to have my evil way with this young lass whether she wants it or not'. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty of the present Bill is that it leaves this element in the mind of the person being harassed and, to a certain extent, of the person doing the harassing. I think it is necessary that the person who would make a complaint under this clause should give something that can be taken as an indication. It would not necessarily be taken as an indication, as I said a few minutes ago, by that particular individual. It may be that the girl would say: 'Keep your rotten hands to yourself'. As I said, there are some men who would take that as encouragement because of the saying that some men like to believe that, when a woman says 'No' she really means 'Yes' and who would proceed on that assumption. But if the girl did say that, or if she has done something to indicate that the advance is unwelcome, it is no defence for him to choose to misinterpret that indication. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably the most aggravating clause of the Bill. That has been clear from the second reading debate and it has been clear from a lot of the nonsense during the second reading debate. A man opening a door for a woman was one example of harassment that one senator gave; and there were other such examples. Clearly, many men do not have any idea of what is harassment. That was shown in the second reading debate. This will be an area of the Bill that will cause a great deal of agitation and worry. The hope of the Opposition in moving these amendments is that we will be able to take out of the Bill something which appears to be of a one-sided nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked by the Opposition to indicate at each clause whether the Australian Democrats intend to oppose or to support the amendments, in order merely to clarify things for the Opposition when it comes to calling divisions. I assure you, Mr Chairman, that this in no way cuts across our signalling system. But it is a matter of convenience for the Opposition. I say on these two amendments that the Democrats will not support the Opposition. We will not support the Opposition because, no matter what Senator Martin says, these two amendments significantly weaken the sexual harassment provisions of the Bill. It took some of us some considerable effort in the first place to strengthen the provisions in the original Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In plain English, what the Opposition appears to be saying in these two amendments is this: Sexual harassment is when a person makes an explicit sexual advance of some sort; the other person then takes 'reasonable' steps to communicate that the advance or conduct, et cetera is unwelcome; and the harasser must make it 'reasonably' clear that the rejection of the advance would disadvantage the person in connection with that person's employment or that, as a result of rejection of the advance, that person would be disadvantaged in connection with that person's employment. That, of course, makes nonsense of Senator Martin's example of a man who is operating with no malice, because, if he is operating with no malice, quite clearly he has no intentions of prejudicing her employment or her advancement and, therefore, has no case to answer under the Act. So I am a little puzzled as to why Senator Martin brought up that particular example. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question that needs to be raised, of course, is what exactly is ' reasonable'. Senator Martin, I must admit, pointed out that there is a problem in this regard. What is reasonable to one person is not reasonable to another. As Senator Martin said, some men have to be hit over the head with a lump of wood before they can be persuaded that one really does not like them. In essence , however, the major problem with these amendments is that sexual harassment appears to be seen as an accepted art form, or piece of human behaviour, or at the very least they are saying: 'OK, have a go and see how far you get'. It perpetuates the power games that we have all been trying to end, in which first the oppressor does the harassing, the oppressed person reacts and then the power goes back once more to the oppressor, because, of course, it is the harasser who is given the right in this circumstance to decide whether the advance will affect the other person's job or future. Most importantly, these two amendments by the Opposition beg the whole question: If a woman believes that by not acceding to an advance she will be disadvantaged in her employment by the person making the advance, she will hardly believe that communicating the fact that she does not like the advance-or that the advance is unwelcome, that she does not like the person, or that she is not feeling like it today-or whatever-will not also disadvantage her. So the whole question is totally begged by the two amendments and the Democrats will most definitely oppose them. </PARA>

They say, purely and simply, firstly that the woman must demonstrate to the man who is supposedly sexually harassing her that his advances are unwelcome-that is all we ask; that she tell him that they are unwelcome-and, secondly, if there is some sort of hold over the woman as regards her job, that it also be indicated that she is concerned about the hold over her job. All I can say is that, if a woman is not prepared to indicate verbally that the advances are unwelcome, I do not believe she has a right to accuse him at a later date of sexual harassment. It cannot be in the mind of the woman alone, as this Bill indicates. We cannot legislate for thinking alone, and to attempt to do so is ridiculous. The Government can at least view the situation in Victoria. The amendments we are adopting follow the Victorian legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr Chairman, the Government does not accept the amendments moved on behalf of the Opposition by Senator Martin for the reasons really that I think were set out very clearly by Senator Haines. The added responsibility that a woman complaining of sexual harassment should have made clear her views, I think, does misrepresent the nature of sexual harassment. Many of the women we are hoping will be protected by this legislation are women who may be migrants and have a poor command of English, or be very young or be in a very inferior position in the work force and would not be in a position to articulate in a way that the harasser found reasonable her objection. Senator Martin agrees that this is often a very difficult thing to do, even when extremely articulate women are doing it. So I think Senator Haines's point about the difficulties this would create for women is our view also. But I would point out too that in both of the clauses to which Senator Martin has moved amendments it is required that the other person has reasonable grounds for believing that a rejection of the advance would disadvantage that person in connection with his or her employment or in connection with his or her education. So it is not just social sexual harassment, it is harassment in connection which would cause disadvantage in employment and education. Obviously a man, or maybe a woman-but it is more likely to be a man-who was doing that, knowing that he could cause disadvantage to that person's education or employment could not be acting innocently in that situation. So for those reasons the amendments are not acceptable to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have a guillotine on the debate which does not include time for divisions. I am told by the Whips that the time for a division in the Senate is approximately eight minutes. The bells are rung for three minutes and then for several minutes we are actually counted. This Opposition, even with its grouping of amendments in moving more than one at a time, if it was to divide on all of those groups it would call for five divisions. There are some of Senator Harradine's amendments that we are supporting and some that we are not. If we were to divide on those we would obviously be here until really well into the evening. Now for reasons that are obvious to all honourable senators it was thought a more sensible arrangement, where we are clearly not going to win a division, to use this form of the Senate.

For example , it could be used to prevent a husband buying clothes as a gift for his wife or things of that kind. There is no need for such an amendment because the matters that I think are of genuine concern to Senator Harradine, such as abortion and sterilisation, are already excluded from the operation of the Bill by virtue of being services which can be rendered to one sex only.

<PARA>ADVICE</PARA>
<PARA>Re: Sex Discrimination Bill 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1.1 There is presently before the Commonwealth Parliament a Bill entitled the Sex Discrimination Bill 1983 (''the Bill''). The central provisions of the Bill prohibit discrimination against another person on the grounds of that person's sex, marital status or pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA>1.2 Section 5 relates to sex discrimination:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(1) For the purposes of this Act a person (the discriminator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of the sex of the aggrieved person if by reason of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the sex of the aggrieved person;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a characteristic that appertains generally to persons of the sex of the aggrieved person; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a characteristic that is generally imputed to persons of the sex of the aggrieved person;</PARA>
<PARA> the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favourably than in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different the discriminator treats or would treat a person of the opposite sex.''</PARA>
<PARA>1.3 Sub-sections 6 (1) and 7 (1) refer to discrimination on the ground of marital status and pregnancy respectively and are substantially the same, although in s.7 (1) (b) a discrimination does not occur if the less favourable treatment is reasonable in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>1.4 I am briefed to advise the Right to Life Association (Vic.) (''the Association'') in respect of the Bill. I must say that I have also been approached formally and informally by a number of organisations and persons seeking views upon particular aspects of the Bill. In some cases the persons seeking that advice have had common interests. I am concerned only with the provisions of the Bill in a legal sense which relate to abortion. But I recognise there are probably other parts of the Bill than those I deal with which are unsatisfactory in a legal or social sense. I do not concern myself with those aspects. </PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 20 and 24</PARA>
<PARA>2.1 It has been said that clause 20 makes it an offence for a person to refuse to provide an abortion or abortion services. Clause 20 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(1) It is unlawful for a person who ........ provides goods or services or makes facilities available, to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex, marital status or pregnancy:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by refusing to provide the other person with those goods or services or to make those facilities available to the other person.''</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ........... </PARA>
<PARA> (c) ........... </PARA>
<PARA>2.2 Services are defined in section 4 as including:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(d) Services of the kind provided by any members of profession or trade;''</PARA>
<PARA>2.3 The argument for the above construction (as I understand it) goes as follows . A doctor can provide the service of abortion. This is so. Many abortions are performed throughout the States of Australia which allegedly comply with existing law. </PARA>
<PARA>2.4 But there are many doctors who (notwithstanding such an abortion is not a criminal offence) conscientiously object to performing abortions and will refuse to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>2.5 What, I understand, is feared is that if clause 20 is enacted the doctor who refuses to perform a ''lawful abortion'' will constitute that doctor a discriminator against the aggrieved person, being the mother. </PARA>
<PARA>2.6 Presumably it will be said that because the aggrieved person requiring an abortion is pregnant she has a characteristic appertaining to the female sex and therefore the doctor is using that fact to discriminate against her. </PARA>
<PARA>2.7 But how can it be said that the doctor is treating her less favourably than he would a person of the opposite sex in circumstances that are the same or not substantially different. The fact of the alleged discrimination ''namely the abortion of a foetus'' depends upon a circumstance (pregnancy) which just does not happen to a man. How can it then be said the discriminator treats or would treat a person of the opposite sex differently. By definition the discriminator cannot treat or refuse to treat a male by way of performing or refusing to perform an abortion. </PARA>
<PARA>2.8 I have read a number of articles which fear such discrimination might arise but I find their reasoning quite unconvincing. I understand fears are also held that persons potentially administering the Act might interpret s.20 this way. If this be so it is a sad commentary upon such persons and it must also imply a deficiency in appellate or review procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>2.9 Likewise it seems to me obviously wrong to say that because a doctor refuses to perform an abortion he is discriminating in the sense that he would treat a person who is not pregnant differently. Once again it seems to me that the circumstance of pregnancy is a fundamental distinguishing factor. It is a case of ''apples and oranges''. One does not perform an abortion on or give advice or services in respect of abortion to a person who is not pregnant. If a doctor says 'I refuse to abort a pregnant woman' that is a discrimination against the operation of abortion. It is a contradiction in terms to say that a doctor would treat a person who is not pregnant differently-he would not treat her at all. </PARA>
<PARA>3.1 I have difficulty in understanding the argument and to the extent that I do understand it I do not accept it. I oppose the concept that a doctor who refuses to perform an abortion discriminates against the mother on the grounds of her sex. The doctor is discriminating between a surgical service which he would perform and in respect of which he has no conscientious objections and one which he does have objections to. </PARA>
<PARA>3.2 What if a doctor unreasonably refuses to perform a prostate operation on any man. Such a refusal surely does not involve a discrimination against the male sex. It is against a particular surgical operation. Indeed it might be the case that such a doctor would say that he would similarly refuse to perform that operation if it could be performed on a woman. Likewise a doctor who has a conscientious objection to abortion (i.e. the destruction of a foetus) would consistently refuse to terminate a foetus in a man if it were possible for a man to be pregnant. But it is the nature of the operation which is the basis of objection to its performance, not the nature of the recipient of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA>3.3 The matter can be further illustrated by taking the situation of a doctor who refuses to provide blood transfusions under any circumstances. Obviously that doctor, if brought before the Court on the grounds of discriminating against the female sex because he refused to give a blood transfusion to Mary Jones, would say 'I do not refuse to give the blood transfusion because its recipient, Mary Jones, is a woman, I'll give it to no-one, including Bill Jones' . A more realistic example could be a surgical operation for which there are some valid grounds of objection, e.g. face lifts. </PARA>
<PARA>3.4 I accordingly consider that the proposition that a doctor discriminates between sexes when he refuses to perform an abortion is untenable. If this were so Mr Bumble's famous dictum 'The law, sir, is an ass' appears credible. </PARA>
<PARA>4.1 Accordingly, when I was first requested informally to advise on the Bill I indicated that I did not consider there was a necessity for amendment. Following this representations were made inter alia by the Association with the result there was added to clause 20 the following:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1A) Nothing in this section applies to or in respect of the provisions of services, the nature of which is such that they can only be provided to members of one sex.'</PARA>
<PARA>4.2 Following this amendment I was asked as to whether it would be necessary or desirable to further amend the Bill. I understood that it would be difficult to obtain further amendments and to press for the same might prejudice the continuance of clause 20 (1A). I accordingly expressed the view that it might not be desirable to 'spoil the ship for a halfpenny of tar'. I adhere to that view. </PARA>
<PARA>4.3 On the other hand if there is any concern about the provisions of clause 24 or any other part of the Act in the context of abortion and if the prosecution of further amendments will not prejudice the principle of clause 20 (1A) I see merit in 'a catch all' definition either in section 4 or by adding to clause 20 (1A) after the words 'in this Section' the words 'or elsewhere in this Act'. For reasons previously stated I do not consider there is a real need for any amendment but if it was intended that the Act should not relate in any way to abortion there seems no reason why this cannot be specifically stated (albeit unnecessarily). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate is apparently placing a great deal of faith in what Mrs Tighe said in respect of these matters. I have not had a chance as yet to look at that legal opinion. I will be happy to do so at some stage. However, I have not heard from Mrs Tighe. It is interesting to note that in fact I prepared the letter which first went out and which was then latched onto by others. I would have thought that the most suitable and courteous thing for Mrs Tighe to have done would have been to contact me or my office in respect of these matters instead of contacting Senator Tate and attempting to undermine some of the more serious attitudes that have been expressed, for example, by the national Right to Life Association and the Right to Life Association in New South Wales which have always adopted a moderate intelligent approach to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make mention of the fact that we are faced with a situation where a variety of legal opinions are going about. We should not judge the matter on just one legal opinion. I have asked certain questions in this chamber on the previous clause which have not been answered. Those questions were prepared by eminent legal authorities. The simple purpose of this clause and the other clause that I moved previously was to put the questions beyond any doubt. I do not know why people do not accept that. </PARA>

<PARA>Harradine blasts tactics over funding</PARA>
<PARA>A concerted campaign is being waged by the Minister for Education, Senator Ryan, to denigrate educationists and parents who are genuinely concerned about Federal Government education funding guidelines, Senator Harradine said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> He was commenting on Senator Ryan's answer to a question by Senator Tate in which she described reported excerpts of a letter to Dominic College parents by its principal, Father John Papworth, as ''inaccurate and misleading.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Obviously neither Senator Ryan nor Senator Tate had read the letter before launching into their attack. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The letter was couched in restrained terms and was absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Indeed Father Papworth told parents that Dominic College; as a Group 3 school would receive a small increase next year. </PARA>
<PARA> ''However, he quite properly drew attention to the fact that the Government's decision to abandon any percentage link between grants for non-government school children and government school standard costs has created uncertainty in education planning with consequences for both non-government and government schools.''</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said this uncertainty was further heightened by Senator Ryan' s pointed refusal in the Senate to provide any guarantee that Group 3 schools would receive more after next year than they would have received under a percentage link formula. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause, which has been highly contentious, relates to certain matters in independent schools. It is probably one of the clauses in the Bill that have attracted very general public attention and a lot of comment. A number of amendments to clause 38 have been mooted by certain people from time to time. The Government amended this part of the legislation when it brought in the Sex Discrimination Bill mark II. The Opposition thinks the Government has not gone quite far enough although it accepts the version that appears in the Bill now under consideration-the Bill mark II. However, we would like to add a few words which are outlined in amendments (9) and (10) on the list circulated in the name of the Opposition. I seek leave to move amendments (9) and (10) together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (9) Page 22, sub-clause 38 (1), line 20, after ''creed'', insert ''or in accordance with stated principles''. </PARA>
<PARA> (10) Page 22, clause 38 (1), line 22, after ''creed'', add ''or in order to avoid a contravention of those stated principles''. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of those amendments would be to add the words 'or in accordance with stated principles' after the word 'creed' and, at the end of the clause, to add the words 'or in order to avoid a contravention of those stated principles'. For people who do not know what the rest of the clause is that does not make a great deal of sense so I will explain. The clause has the heading 'Educational institutions established for religious purposes'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in paragraph 14 (1) (a) or (b) or 14 (2) (c) renders it unlawful for a person to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person' s sex, marital status or pregnancy-</PARA>
<PARA>That means discrimination is allowable-</PARA>
<PARA>in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an educational institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is there we want to add the words 'or in accordance with stated principles'. The clause continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if the first-mentioned person so discriminates in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed. </PARA>
<PARA>Then we would add the words 'or in order to avoid a contravention of those stated principles'. What we are seeking to do is not to confine this exemption, this let-out clause, to only those schools that are religious based. We think of other independent schools such as grammar schools and so on. It ought to be borne in mind that this Bill does not apply to many schools. It does not apply to most government schools and its substantial impact in the educational area is on independent schools. Most independent schools have been founded by a church such as the Catholic Church or, as it used to be known, the Presbyterian and Methodist schools board, the Anglican Church and others. They have a tradition of establishment of schools at which they teach to the same standards of curriculum as is taught in government schools but they also have a religious input, not just in religious classes but in standards of behaviour according to the dogma of the religion. But there are a few other independent schools which are ecumenical or non-religious. Nevertheless, they are very deliberately independent schools. They have reasons for existing. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about ecumenical schools or ones that do not have any religion at all. They have a particular reason for existing. They do not exist because there is no other school in the town or out of bloody mindedness towards the government school system. They are in existence as much as anything because they want to carry out certain standards in education and behaviour. By behaviour I mean standards of behaviour in the community that they want to instil in their students to hold up as an ideal. They want to have some right of sanction if those standards are not adhered to in the school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that our amendments would affect very few schools but those which it affects it affects very importantly. It would put those schools on the same basis as those which are based on a particular religion or creed. Senator Walters very properly pointed out that there are some schools which call themselves Christian schools without saying that they are Anglican schools, Roman Catholic schools, Presbyterian-Methodist schools or anything like that. I hope that the Government will accept these amendments because we think they will help the Bill. While I am on my feet, although it has not yet been moved, Senator Harradine has circulated an amendment, No. (11). If the amendments of the Opposition are not carried I indicate at this stage that we will not support Senator Harradine's amendment because the effect of his amendment is far broader than the effect of ours and, to some extent, it would negate other important principles of this anti-discrimination Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not support the Opposition's amendments to clause 38. The clause sets out to make further exemptions for educational institutions. Already, it provides a further extension of exemptions to the Government's original Bill for educational institutions established for religious purposes.

<PARA> The Opposition wants to extend this provision within the Bill to include the words 'or in accordance with stated principles'. It seems to me that quite frequently the words 'stated principles'-I am sure the Opposition does not mean them in this way-are a mere euphemism for stated prejudices of the sort that go 'I am not a racist but-' or 'I am all for equal opportunity but-'. At best ' stated principles' is a pretty broad term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I said that I do not believe the Opposition is putting it forward that way as being an equivalent statement. I am merely saying that frequently people say they have principles when they mean that they have prejudices. My Party has already been prepared to accept the Government's extension of the exemption to religious schools although we are not terribly happy about it. But we are not prepared to make a fuss over it since we will clearly not get any support as the Opposition wants to broaden the exemption further. We therefore are not prepared to support the weakening of the Bill in this area any more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think there is any necessity to extend the number of people who have the right to take their views, distorted or whatever they are, out on other people. We would not permit the perpetration in schools of anti-semitism, anti- catholicism, racism or anything else on the grounds that it conformed with somebody's stated principles so I fail to see why we should allow the perpetration of discrimination against women on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy simply because it conforms with somebody's stated principles . At the very best this frequently means the perpetration of stereotyping and narrow roles for both sexes. At the worst it comes to out and out misogyny and the Democrats will not support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I will reply briefly to some of the points that have been raised. The Government does not accept the amendments. We consider that the exemption provided for schools on the grounds of religious belief and creed is very broad and there is no way we could broaden it any further bearing in mind that the principle of this Bill is that people ought not to be discriminated against in employment or education on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy. Accommodating the fact that there are religious views or views in connection with a creed in a community that would require people to prefer to employ married persons or unmarried persons is as far as we can go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walters suggested that Christian schools conducted in accordance with a general Christian philosophy would not be covered. A school would be covered by this clause if it is conducted in accordance with the doctrines of a religion. It does not have to advocate a particular religion so Christian schools would be covered. I should point out too that all schools, government and non-government, are covered by the education provisions of the Bill. State government employees are not covered by the legislation, which is why employment in State government schools is not covered but education is covered. Of course, State government employees, including teachers, are covered in those States which have State legislation. For those reasons the Opposition's amendments are not accepted. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 24, sub-clause 42 (2), after paragraph (d), add the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '; or (e) sporting activities by children who have not yet attained the age of 12 years'. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 42 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in Division 1 or 2 renders it unlawful to exclude persons of one sex from participation in any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-clause (2) then lists what does not apply in relation to the exclusion of persons from participation. That includes the coaching of persons from participation. That includes the coaching of persons, umpiring, refereeing, administration of any sporting activity and any prescribed sporting activity. I am aware that that clause appears to cover the area which is affected by my amendment; that is, sporting activities of children who have not yet attained the age of 12. However, in this area people are prone not to let facts get in the way of a good argument and tend to attempt to preclude mixed sporting activities of children under the age of 12 by perpetrating an assortment of myths relating to the comparative strength, stamina and physique of boys and girls under the age of 12. I suggest that it is at this very age that girls not only are generally the equal of boys in height, strength, running ability and so on but also are frequently their superiors. If we are at any stage to overcome the myth that girls' hips stop them from running fast, that their elbow joints stop them from throwing properly, or whatever the various arguments are for excluding women from competing against and with men, we will have to do it when it is quite clearly shown that there is considerable equality between the sexes.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore argue that the addition of the words 'or (e) sporting activities by children who have not yet attained the age of 12 years' to clause 41 (2) is not in any way superfluous. This is an age at which attitudes are formed, at which the competition may be genuine and at which it can be easily demonstrated that the differences between males and females in sporting activities are less due to unequal stamina and strength than to lack of competition or to some sort of spread of mythology. I think there is a problem in that people in the community will persist in pursuing the myths relating to strength, stamina and physique with regard to sport. I believe that if we can scotch that at pre-puberty by actively saying within this Bill that sporting activities for children under the age of 12 should include children of both sexes, we will go a long way to effecting the general principle and spirit of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> (13) Page 25, after clause 43, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Conscientious objection</PARA>
<PARA> ''43A. (1) Nothing in Division 1 or 2 renders it unlawful for a person to decline to perform or participate in the performance of any act the performance of which would be contrary to genuinely held conscientious beliefs of that person. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) In sub-section (1), 'conscientious beliefs' means any conscientious beliefs , whether the grounds for the beliefs are or are not of a religious character and whether the beliefs are or are not part of the doctrine of any religion.''. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, this amendment is so important that I draw your attention to the state of the House. (Quorum formed) I called a quorum because this matter is of great importance to the conscience and protection of the consciences of individuals. Honourable senators who may not have been following this debate may not have heard some of the interpretations that have been given by the Minister in respect of certain clauses. It is perfectly clear that those interpretations mean that this legislation will force persons to choose between the law and their consciences. I have given the examples and the Minister has indicated that I am correct, in respect of the hotel-keeper. Not only will that person have to go against his conscience and undermine his personal integrity; he will also lose his business. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24 deals with land and its disposal. I ask the Committee to bear in mind that, as I am advised, the giving of a weekly or monthly tenancy involves a disposal 'of an estate or interest in land', as does the granting of any leasehold interest. Bearing that in mind, if a person were fortunate enough to own a house additional to the one in which that person and family lived, that person, according to the Minister, would act unlawfully if, in accepting a tenant from a number of applicants who had responded to a 'To Let' advertisement , he or she preferred a married couple to a de facto couple solely or partly on the ground of marital status. That person might have a genuine conscientious concern. As a result of this measure, as has been admitted by the Minister, that person would have to defile his or her own conscience in order to prevent that person from breaching the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the matter can be illustrated by using a country pharmacist or doctor as an example. A country pharmacist would be well known in his town and would know everybody in the town. Under this legislation, he would be regarded as a discriminator if he refused to provide contraceptives, for example , to a single person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that is clear. The country pharmacist would have to get out of the business or go against his conscience. He might have a belief, one which I do not share, that it is quite in order to stock contraceptives and provide them to married couples. The Minister in her previous interpretation has virtually said that the pharmacist's only defence would be that he did not stock contraceptives at all. This is the problem with which the person and the community would be faced. I propose in my amendment a provision which would enable the pharmacist, in this case, to continue his operation but would allow him to honour his obligations to his conscience.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has not been following the debate. His remark has nothing to do with the price of fish. If Senator Robertson had been following this debate, he would not have said what he said because it has nothing to do with it. I am not talking about a Catholic pharmacist; I am talking about a pharmacist. If he were a Catholic pharmacist, presumably he would have some problem about supplying contraceptives, full stop. I do not know whether my last supposition is correct because I am not a pharmacist and have not had to face that situation. My example is that of any pharmacist, Catholic or not, who has a conscientious concern about these matters and who may want to supply contraceptives only to married couples and not to single persons. Other examples could include nurses, doctors and people in the paramedical profession. In this amendment, I propose that people should have the ability to be able to choose and to satisfy their consciences. I would like the Committee to note what Senator Tate, who is not in the chamber, said in his speech on the Budget on 23 August 1978. It must have been soon after he came here. Things must have changed since. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Conscience, I hope, will never be regarded as a disease in Australia. Rather we as legislators ought to be reinforcing the individual conscience as that which culturally makes us what we are-a society where the common good cannot be secured by means which destroy the individual personality. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Committee to look at the Law Reform Commission's discussion papers which were presented to us yesterday, particularly volume 2. Finally, because of the time-it is a disgrace that we have to deal with such an important matter in such a short time-I refer to the letter which has been tabled in this Parliament by the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans), the letter of Archbishop Carroll of 25 November 1983. In that letter to the Prime Minister in respect of this matter the Archbishop said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . nothing that you have said concerning the operation of the Bill in relation to 'de facto spouses' or to the matter of discrimination on the ground of marital status serves to allay my fear that the measure will, in some circumstances, require a person to choose between conscience and the law.</PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that a law which denies to a citizen the right to prefer a married couple to a de facto couple in areas of accommodation, leasing, dealings with children and in domestic situations, is oppressive. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a law has the effect of denigrating the institution of marriage whether or not that is the intention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Archbishop went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am, however, encouraged by your assurance that further consideration is being given to the many matters that I have raised in this general area in my earlier letter and in our discussions. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has come forward from the Minister which shows that there has been further consideration of this matter. I believe we have a choice here today. We can uphold the rights of the individual citizen not to have to choose between conscience and the law. If we are to do that, at least we have to support a conscientious objection provision such as that proposed in my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that Senator Harradine can provide examples of certain situations in which a person ought to have a conscientious belief recognised and have perhaps the opportunity not to observe all aspects of the law or to have them applied to him. But the language of this amendment makes it an impossible amendment. I have not given it very close study , but its language is such that it would run a cart-horse through the legislation. It covers what is called conscientious belief. We know that that term is much overused in this Parliament. I think we all vote according to our consciences, and make up our minds on various matters according to conscience. We perhaps vote according to our parties' views. That may be in accordance with the conscience of some, particularly if it is a non-religious one. But ' conscience' is a much overused word. The amendment makes it clear that a conscientious belief is such, whether it is religious or not. What could happen? One who genuinely holds a conscientious belief can take himself outside the effect of this law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allow Senator Harradine to answer Senator Missen's comments. I will therefore speak very briefly on this matter. I believe that the Government has said that it does not believe that this Bill interferes with religious beliefs. If that is the case, the Government will have no problem in agreeing to Senator Harradine's amendment, because as the situation stands now it affects people with strong religious beliefs. I mention, for instance, the situation of a person wanting to employ someone for his small shop-a corner store. If that person expected certain standards of behaviour from that employee, with whom he would be working in close contact-in this respect there is a difference between a corner store and, say, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-I believe that he must have the option of picking someone who will abide by those standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government may well believe, judging from the interjections we had a few minutes ago from Senator Robertson and others, that some religions are bigoted, but that is not the Government's problem. It is not for the Government to interfere with religious beliefs. There is no place for governments to interfere with religious beliefs in this country. We are very proud of our freedom of religion. If the Government believes that some religions are bigoted, it is not up to the Government to change them. I object very strongly, on behalf of those religions, to the Government's attempt to interfere with some of those religious beliefs. I do not care how the Government feels about this. I do not necessarily agree with some of the religions we have in Australia, but I will never abide a government interfering and saying that these religions are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is the Government, who is the Minister, to interfere? The Minister for Education and Youth Affairs (Senator Ryan) knows who she is. She is arrogantly laughing and saying: 'Yes, I am the Minister'. She may think she is all powerful and, with a Caucus vote behind her and with the Australian Democrats willing to support anything at all that the Government puts up on this issue, she is certainly very powerful. But the Government will rue the day that it interferes with religious beliefs in this country, because that is what it will do if it opposes this amendment put by Senator Harradine. I certainly give it my full support and I hope that Senator Harradine will be able to allay the fears of Senator Missen, whom I believe has incorrectly interpreted the amendment put by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

In respect of Senator Missen's speech, I understood that the Opposition was supporting my amendment. I had been given some very great guarantees that the Opposition would support it. Yet Senator Missen opposed it. That is a disgrace. Apparently Senator Missen can pick and choose. Who am I to go to now? Do I go to the Opposition honourable senator who is dealing with the Bill, or do I go to the Whip, and having been told something do I then have to go to every member of the Opposition to find out whether he or she will support it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What a specious argument has been put up by Senator Missen. The provisions contained in my amendment are the very conscientious objection provisions that are contained in legislation now. The wording of the amendment was not made up by me. It has a foundation in existing legislation. Senator Missen should know that. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act, for example, is one such piece of legislation. It is not hard for the industrial registrar to determine whether a person is a genuine conscientious objector to joining a union. Which is more important to Senator Missen: To have that conscientious objection provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or to have it put in the Sex Discrimination Bill, which deals with very major moral issues? I would have thought it more important to have it in the Sex Discrimination Bill, which deals with very major and fundamentally important issues of conscience. I am surprised that Senator Missen does not know that, under further sections of the legislation, those on whom the responsibility to question this will include the Human Rights Commission. If the Commission cannot deal with it, it will go to the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Government will not accept Senator Harradine's amendment because it undermines the basic purpose of the Sex Discrimination Bill. The Bill says that persons do not have the right to discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas covered by the Bill. Senator Harradine's amendment, as Senator Missen has pointed out, seeks to reverse that situation and to provide that one does have the right to discriminate if one's conscience tells one that women are inferior, unable to be trusted, or anything else. I use the analogy of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Harradine said it would be a dreadful thing if a person could not follow his conscience and discriminate against people in order to protect his business. Everybody knows that when the Racial Discrimination Act was enacted some hotel proprietors said: 'Well, we don 't want to allow Aborigines into our pubs because it might be bad for business'.

But in general the Bill is about providing that there shall not be discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy, even if an employer believes that women are inferior or that married women should stay at home and not be entitled to earn income in the paid work force. Under this legislation that conscientiously held belief cannot be used to deny a person's right to employment.

<PARA> (12) Page 33, clause 66, lines 14 to 18, leave out the clause, insert the following new clause: Inquiries to be held in private '66. (1) Subject to sub- section (2), an inquiry shall be held in private. </PARA>
<PARA> '(2) The Commission may, on the application of the respondent to an inquiry, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, direct that an inquiry, or part of an inquiry, be held in public.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I move these amendments together, although one concerns clause 65 (1) and the other concerns section 66, is that they are roughly bracketed in that they both apply to the conduct of an inquiry by the Commission. The first amendment, amendment (11), would have the effect of giving an absolute right to legal counsel when appearing before the Commission. At present clause 65 allows a party to have legal representation only if the Commission gives leave. We think that there should be a right of representation if the person feels that he or she needs legal representation. For a variety of reasons that I will not go into we think that that is a very important right for anyone involved in an inquiry. I am sure the reasons people need legal counsel are manifest on any occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment relates to inquiries being held in private. The present clause 66 states that inquiries may be held in private. It requires that they be held in public unless:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission may, of its own motion or on the application of a party to the inquiry if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, direct that an inquiry . . . be held in private. </PARA>
<PARA>We reverse that situation and say that as a general rule inquiries should be held in private, but if the Commission believes it is appropriate they may be held in public. I think that in this sense privacy is very important. The situation in which it is necessary for an inquiry to be public is rather limited , whereas there can be a very important reason for an inquiry being held in private. It may be that if an inquiry is to be held in public certain people would be deterred from making complaints. On the other hand, there may be some mischief done by virtue of the fact that inquiries are likely to be in public. There could be some proceedings which in the end are not justified, but damage may be done, particularly when publicity attends those proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have preferred that the nature of the operation of this Bill be low key and non-controversial. Indeed, I understood that that was the Government's view also. The general holding of inquiries in private would assist this and make them a far less traumatic or intimidatory experience for people, many of whom, to their great surprise, may find a complaint made and pursued against them. As has been exhibited in some of the debate, there is a considerable ignorance on the subject of what is sex discrimination or discrimination on the ground of marital status. That will persist in the minds of many for a considerable time, even though they may be people who do not believe themselves to be particularly bigoted. I may need to say more on our amendment (11). I am afraid that I have two versions of it in my hand. I will leave the matter there but may seek the call again in a moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Government does not accept the amendments. It has given great thought to the matters raised by the Opposition but believes that the Bill, as drafted, is more satisfactory than it would be if amended. I point out to Senator Martin that the conciliation proceedings, the first action which follows a complaint being brought under this legislation, will be in private; also that clause 92 provides that particulars of complaints are not to be communicated. So quite a deal of protection is already afforded in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to clause 66, it is the view of the Government that unless circumstances exist which require in camera hearings the Commission's hearings should be in public. The new non-publication clause, clause 67, will provide an added safeguard. Clause 66, as drafted, recognises both the educative value of having a hearing in public and that circumstances exist in which a hearing should be in private. I believe that to be the most satisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to clause 65 and the matter of representation, if counsel assisting is appointed parties have an automatic right of legal representation. In other cases representation is with leave of the Commission. It was not considered necessary to have representation in all cases and a provision such as the Opposition is suggesting may cause problems for a party who cannot afford to have a solicitor present but does not qualify for legal aid. The Commission is not a court and clause 77 makes it clear that the proceedings are to be conducted with as little formality as possible. As drafted, clause 65 is in keeping with this. The clause gives the Commission the option, if the circumstances so warrant, to agree to repre- sentation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may reply briefly to the Minister, it may not always be apparent to the Commission why counsel is necessary. People tend to be rather intimidated by legal proceedings, even though they may be informal. They may freeze and not do themselves justice. Frequently, people will use legal counsel, and may strictly need legal counsel, even though they may not be required to in regard to certain provisions, simply because they are literally not capable of handling their cases themselves and of being coherent when being asked questions by people in authority. It really ought to be up to the individual to decide whether or not such support is needed. Frankly, we are thinking particularly of the disadvantaged person. For hearings before the Commission it would not be, I would think, a major undertaking to have someone appear with them. That is all I wish to say concerning our amendment (12).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now obvious that the Government sees the accused as the big, bad employer who has everything at his disposal and the person making the complaint as the poor, disadvantaged woman. That will not always be the case. Surely to heavens the Government can understand that. I propose to bring to the attention of the Minister a situation that is the exact reverse, one in which a rather clever woman has an employer who is a simple soul , who is far from sexually harassing her but who, she decides, she can perhaps have a hold over by making a threat to take action. If such a case reaches the Human Rights Commission and the employer is not capable of representing himself under the Bill as it stands he will not be able to seek legal representation. All of the incriminating evidence can be demanded by the Commission but, as I say, legal representation can be denied the accused. It seems to me incredible that the Government would allow that to happen, would allow someone to be denied legal representation. I cannot understand the Government's thinking; there is no justice in what is proposed. It denies all our normal methods of justice. It is incomprehensible that the Government should say arbitrarily: 'Unless the Human Rights Commission gives permission we will deny these people legal representation. They must be able to stand before the Human Rights Commission and defend themselves. If they are not capable of doing that, bad luck, because we will not allow an automatic right of legal representation.' Such a proposition seems quite incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, if a decision is not taken that for a very special reason proceedings should be held in private they will automatically be held in public and we could have a situation such as already exists, in that some women may hold employers to ransom and say; 'If I do not get that promotion'-or whatever, 'I will take you to the anti-discrimination commission and you will have to put up with all the publicity that goes with that'. Of course, the employer, not wanting the publicity, will perhaps pay up or give the women what she requires. It seems to me again quite incredible that the Minister would not want full protection to allow this to be done in private in the first instance-at least until it reaches the Federal Court of Australia-if it can be done in private, unless the Commissioner believes, for some very special reason, that it should be made public. At least there would be protection for those who are innocent. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a situation fairly recently in which a gentleman was called publicly before a board under the provisions of the anti-discrimination legislation in New South Wales. He was hauled before that board and found innocent. The amount of publicity that matter attracted, I believe, was very unjust. The Opposition seeks to amend this provision so that proceedings are held in private at least until a matter reaches the Federal Court. It seems to me that, through intimidation alone, the Minister is attempting to get this legislation through so that women can use intimidation in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Senator Walters's deep concern for sexual harassers and discriminating employers is very touching, but I am afraid it leaves me untouched. I must correct a couple of misrepresentations she has made amongst a vast army of misrepresentations which we have had to tolerate from Senator Walters in the course of this debate. Senator Walters talked about the 'accused' and 'offences' . I remind the Committee that we are not dealing with criminal proceedings; we are not dealing with offences. We are dealing with complaints that illegal acts may have been committed. It is very clear from the legislation as it is drafted that if there is a case in which the person complained of-the respondent-feels that he or she needs legal representation and, if the circumstances justify it, that request can be made to the Commission. I see no reason for believing that the Commission will not behave responsibly in this fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So there is no basis at all for Senator Walters's portrayal of what, apparently , she thinks is a situation of treacherous and vicious women rushing to the Commission in order to destroy the reputation of employers by accusing them of discrimination or sexual harassment. I think that is really a disgraceful caricature of what the situation we are trying to deal with typically is. I just repeat that, having considered very carefully the points raised by the Opposition prior to our reaching this stage of the debate, we believe that the clauses, as drafted, provide both the possiblity of private hearings, where that is justified, and the benefit of public hearings. We believe they provide the possibility of legal representation when circumstances require it but the capacity to proceed informally if circumstances justify that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on this point. The only reason why I rise is to indicate that previously, when Senator Walters spoke, she suggested that this idea was unprecedented. We have had such situations before where there is discretion by the Commission. One example is the Repatriation Commission. The intent is to try to keep the proceedings at low cost and not to have them in a totally adversary context. I think the two propositions we have in this situation probably turn very much on whether one wants to give the Commissioner that type of discretion. I believe that in these circumstances the Commissioner would be the appropriate person to decide whether the operation should be conducted in private. I am quite sure that, if the circumstances indicated that the protection of individuals was concerned, the Commissioner would, in fact, conduct the proceedings in private.</PARA></TALK.START>

In quiet reflection I say that I am rather anxious to move on a little and to explain one thing that appears on the list of amendments circulated in the name of the Opposition.

I would like-not necessarily at this instant because I think it is really more important that Senator Harradine has the opportunity to move his amendment No. (16) and we get a chance to express a view-the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs ( Senator Ryan) when she next replies to something to give me an explanation of clause 78.

We do not believe it is appropriate for lawyers to be involved to the extent that some members of the Opposition clearly do. We believe that the provision whereby the Commission can allow, when circumstances justify it, is as Senator Macklin says not a precedent and we believe to be a more acceptable approach. As to Senator Martin's ojections to clause 78, the purpose of clause 78 is to enable the Commission itself to be not put to the task of going through in every inquiry all the exemptions and exceptions in the Sex Discrimination Bill in order to determine whether or not they apply. If a party wishes to raise the application, or possible application, of exemption the Commission will consider it. It may be that the complainant is the first party to raise the possible application of exemption, for example, where the respondent agrees there has been discrimination but says that a particular exemption applies and the complaint alleges misinterpretation of the extent of the exemption. Certainly the clause is aimed at enabling the Commission to deal with matters expeditiously and we believe that is a reasonable clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (c) an approved statutory body established by a State,.'</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 104 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing under its seal, delegate to a member of the Commission , the Commissioner, a member of the staff of the Commission or another person or body of persons all or any of the powers conferred on the Commission under this Act, other than- (a) powers in connection with the performance of the functions that, under section 49, are to be performed by the Commissioner on behalf of the Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) this power of delegation. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 104 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner may,</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner-</PARA>
<PARA>either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, by writing signed by the Commissioner, delegate to- (a) a member of the staff of the Commission; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any other person or body of persons,</PARA>
<PARA>approved by the Commission, all or any of the powers exercisable by the Commissioner . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinarily broad right to delegate power. Taking it to an absurd conclusion, under this provision the Commission could delegate power to investigate a complaint to the complainant or to the aggrieved person. That is how crazy and how broad this delegatory power is. It may not do this. For example, Wendy McCarthy-I doubt whether she would be appointed now-could delegate to people in the Women's Electoral Lobby or Anne Summers could delegate to people in WEL the investigation of complaints made under this provision. I understand why this provision is included in the Bill. The delegation provision will allow complaints to be dealt with in those areas where the Human Rights Commission is not established and also to delegate to, for example, the sex discrimination boards in the various State complaints which they may deal with. I have catered for that and for something else as well. I have catered for the situation where complaints about discrimination in employment are currently being dealt with very efficiently and effectively by the discrimination committees in the various States and by the discrimination in employment and occupation committees and by the national committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I say 'efficiently' and 'effectively' because those committees are tripartite in character. The Government is represented on these committees. Employers are represented on the committees. The trade union movement is represented on those committees. Those committees have been working efficiently and effectively in this area for many years. I am concerned that the good work they have been able to achieve and are likely to be able to continue to achieve will count for nought if we adopt this clause because the bias on the part of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner could be against such committees. Therefore, I have catered for those two possibilities by these amendments. I have suggested that the words 'or any other person or body of persons' be deleted and the following words included:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the National Committee, or the relevant State Committee, on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an approved statutory body established by a State-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martin rightly points out that this delegation clause has been raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. In its tenth report, dated 19 October 1983, it had this to say in relation exactly to this clause-which at that stage was clause 94 of the previous Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This clause also contains a now quite standard provision, in this case relating to the delegation of the powers of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that it has become a quite standard provision in a lot of legislation that the Minister or somebody delegates powers. The report continues :</PARA>
<PARA> This clause empowers both the Commission and the Sexual Discrimination Commissioner to delegate thier statutory powers of inquiry to other Commission Officers, or indeed to 'any other person or body of persons'. This power of delegation is not limited by reference to the qualifications of persons who may exercise the relevant powers. The Attorney-General's response states that, 'In view of the variety of functions which might be delegated, it would be impractical to list all the persons or bodies who or which might conceivably at any time in the future be considered able to exercise functions under the Bill or attempt to define the qualifications such persons or bodies should have'. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of that, the Committee then put in its report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledges the response of the Attorney-General which answers satisfactorily the concern it expressed in relation to clause 94. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, presumably, it satisfactorily answers the concern in relation to clause 104. The national committee, the relevant State committee on discrimination in employment and occupation or any approved statutory body established by a State, are not excluded or precluded from being used by the Commission to have powers delegated to it. For those reasons, we shall not be supporting this amendment. </PARA>

For example, there is a community education function which could well be delegated to the Community Education Council; and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ryan has not addressed herself to the questions that I posed. Nothing that has been said here has given any indication as to why she cannot, and why the Australian Democrats cannot, accept an amendment. What we are trying to do here is to prevent the indiscriminate delegation of power. It is all very well to say that there is provision for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is not very satisfying to people who may not have the money and may not have the legal expertise to know that. The Minister's statement that this may be needed to delegate powers of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the Human Rights Commission on the community education function is a most important question. I believe that it is even more important, then, that we adopt my amendment, which would ensure that the delegation of the power goes to either the discrimination in employment and occupation committees or an approved statutory body established by a State. If the Minister is concerned about whether the State or the Commonwealth should be involved, that is another matter; but there has to be an approved statutory body .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this is taking away from the Parliament and, indeed, to mention Senator Haines's point, taking away from the Minister, any power of delegation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We have got eight minutes to deal with the remainder of the Bill, from clause 111 onwards. We have yet to deal with pages 47 to 57 of the Bill. The two amendments which I will move will make more accountable the actions of the Commission and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. I mention to the Committee that clause 111 (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission, a member of the Commission, the Commissioner or a person acting under the direction or authority of the Commission or of the Commissioner or pursuant to a delegation under section 104 is not liable to an action or other proceeding for damages for or in relation to an act done or omitted to be done in good faith in the performance or purposed performance of any function, or in the exercise or purported exercise of any power or authority, conferred on the Commission or the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>My amendment seeks to omit certain words and to add these words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to an act done or omitted to be done honestly and in good faith in the due performance of any function or in the exercise in good faith of any power or authority conferred on the Commission or the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it is fair enough for a non-elected non-judicial commissioner, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission to be protected from civil action brought by innocent citizens because they can claim that they acted 'in the purported performance of any function'. The actions, whatever they are, should have been done honestly and in good faith and in the due performance of any function. That then places a real onus on the Commissioner and the Human Rights Commission to act properly. My second amendment deals with a similar matter. I seek to have these words added at the end of clause 111 (2):</PARA>
<PARA>. . . unless it appears on the balance of probabilities that the complaint or submission had been made or the document or information had been furnished or evidence had been given in bad faith with an intention to cause loss, damage or injury to another person. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, for example, where a complainant, the aggrieved person, or indeed it could be the discriminator, might bring evidence before the Human Rights Commission, which may be an open session, which may be quite damaging or injurious to the discriminator or the aggrieved person. In those circumstances, I believe that if evidence had been furnished in bad faith with the intention of causing loss, damage or injury to another person that person ought to be liable. The essence of my proposed two amendments is to ensure accountability and responsibility on the part of all parties to these proceedings under this legislation. I seek leave to move my amendments Nos (20) and (21) together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Government opposes these amendments. With regard to amendment (No. (20) moved by Senator Harradine, it is necessary to provide that an action done in good faith-in the belief that it can be done-be protected. Thus, functions can still be performed even if, for example, there might be a technical defect in a delegation given. With respect to Senator Harradine's amendment No. (21), the Government opposes it. There is already power in the Commission to reject a complaint if it is vexatious. The Commissioner can ignore any submissions or evidence of this nature and if evidence is false or misleading an offence might occur. What Senator Harradine suggests would enable the discriminator to threaten a potential complainant with a legal action to deter that person from making a complaint. To provide a respondent with such a weapon is not necessary because the Commissioner or the Commission can use its good offices to resolve such problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>M83/11639:SB Senator Brian Harradine,Senator for TasmaniaParliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Harradine,</PARA>
<PARA> During the Second Reading Debates on the Sex Discrimination Bill 1983 you expressed your intention to seek further details of the Government's interpretation of various Articles of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. </PARA>
<PARA> You will appreciate, as the Bill deals with discrimination in certain specified areas, a number of Articles of the Convention will not be relevant. Article 6 ( exploitation of prostitution), Article 9 (nationality rights), Article 16 ( rights relating to marriage) and Parts V and VI of the Convention, for example, fall outside the scope of this particular legislation. In addition to these a number of aspects of other Articles will also not be relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the relationship between the Convention and the Bill a further factor to bear in mind is that the Convention deals with two themes: measures to eliminate discrimination by ensuring equality of rights, and measures to prevent discrimination. It is the first of these themes with which Part II of the Sex Discrimination Bill is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these matters I enclose a copy of a note my Department has prepared on the interpretation of relevant Articles of the Convention. I understand the Prime Minister wrote to you some time ago in regard to some specific matters of interpretation you raised concerning Articles of the Convention. The attached note is fairly general and if after reading it you see any specific problems you may wish to raise these with me. </PARA>
<PARA> During the continuation of your speech on the Sex Discrimination Bill last Friday you also sought an assurance as to the position of pharmacists who did not wish to supply certain drugs, such as abortifacients, to customers. As Senator Ryan indicated at the time, if a pharmacist refused to stock these drugs that pharmacist would not commit an act of discrimination under the legislation. The essence of discrimination in clause 5 of the Bill is less favourable treatment on the ground of the sex of a person. A pharmacist who does not stock particular goods is not in a position to supply them to any person, so the sex, or indeed marital status, of the customer is irrelevant. A further consideration is that the refusal to stock the goods is because of the pharmacist's concern about the nature of the goods, not about the sex of any potential customer. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,GARETH EVANS</PARA>
<PARA>CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN</PARA>
<PARA>Relationship to provisions of the Sex Discrimination Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Article 1 Definition of ''discrimination against women''. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 2 General obligations to ensure elimination of discrimination against women</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the elimination of discrimination against women and has chosen the Sex Discrimination Bill as an appropriate means of implementing obligations in Article 2. A number of the requirements of this Article can be satisfied by non-legislative means, such as through the conciliation and community education functions vested in the Human Rights Commission under the Sex Discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 3 Article 3 is complementary to Article 2. Whereas Article 2 requires measures to eliminate discrimination, Article 3 requires measures to ensure equality. Article 3 is in general terms and does not oblige State parties to any particular course of action. One of the objectives which the Human Rights Commission has under its own Act and under the Sex Discrimination legislation is to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Australians without distinctions such as sex. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 4 Article 4 allows States Parties to adopt temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women: however these measures must be discontinued when their objectives have been achieved. Article 4.2 allows State Parties to adopt measures aimed at protecting maternity. These matters are reflected in the exemptions provided in the Sex Discrimination Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 5 Article 5 requires appropriate measures-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women. </PARA>
<PARA>This obligation is concerned with measures to eliminate prejudices and practices based on inferiority or superiority of either sex or on stereotyped roles of men and women. Stereotyping occurs where a particular role which is quite capable of being performed by either sex, is regarded as the preserve of one sex only, that is, without reference to the capabilities of individual members of that sex. The Sex Discrimination Bill is concerned with equality of opportunity. Neither the Convention nor the Bill requires that a man or woman is to be compelled to choose any particular role or to avail themselves of this equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) to ensure family education includes a proper understanding of maternity as a social function and the recognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children, it being understood that the interest of the children is the primordial consideration in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA>This obligation is not concerned with the actions of individuals and how they instruct their families. The Government interprets this obligation consistently with Article 23 of the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights which recognizes that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection. Part II of the Sex Discrimination Bill is not inconsistent with the principle in Article 23. </PARA>
<PARA>Articles 7 and 8 These Articles are concerned with equal participation in public and political life and are self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 10 Article 10 contains a number of specific requirements aimed at equality of opportunity and access to education and the elimination of discrimination. This will enable men and women to compete on the basis of skills and merit without regard to their sex. Similarly the Sex Discrimination Bill contains provisions aimed at ensuring equality of access to education and training. The Article does not require the abolition of single-sex schools but requires opportunities to be made available for equivalent standards of education, equivalent courses of study and equal access to higher education. The Article is also concerned with the quality of access to specific educational information on matters of health but not with the content of that information. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 11 Article 11 contains a number of specific requirements aimed at equality of rights in employment and employment-related areas. Sub-Article 11.1 is concerned with equal enjoyment of the rights listed therein and does not create separate rights for women. In this regard two matters should be noted: first, the reservation lodged on ratification in regard to employment of women in the Defence Force in combat and combat-related duties and secondly, the recognition in sub-Article 11.3 of the existence of certain ''protective legislation'' which may be applicable to matters listed in the Article. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sex Discrimination Bill contains provisions aimed at the elimination of discrimination in matters relating to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-Article 11.2 provides that certain measures should be taken in order to prevent discrimination against women on the ground of marriage or maternity and to ensure their effective right to work. Regard should also be had to the reservation lodged on ratification in respect of paid maternity leave. Paragraph 11.2 (a), prohibition of dismissal on the ground of pregnancy or maternity leave and discrimination in dismissals on the basis of marital status, is the only part of the sub-Article of direct relevance to the Sex Discrimination Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 12 Sub-Article 12.1 deals with equality of access to health care services. These are matters falling within the prohibition in the Sex Discrimination Bill on discrimination in the provision of services and facilities. The sub-Article is concerned with the provision of access to services and does not impose an obligation to provide services that are not already available. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 13 Article 13 is concerned with equality in economic and social life. In this regard the Sex Discrimination Bill covers discrimination in regard to the provision of services, Article 13 (b) (the right to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit), and in regard to clubs, Article 13 (c) (the right to participate in recreational activities, sports and all aspects of cultural life). In regard to Article 13 (c), this obligation is to give women the same freedom of choice as regards what sporting and recreational activities they may wish to pursue as men. It does not require that all such sporting activities be mixed. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 14 Article 14 is concerned with the special problems of rural women. The rights enumerated in sub-Article 14 (2) are interpreted as being concerned with the equality of rural women and rural men. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 15 Article 15 is concerned with the question of equality of men and women before the law. This question is of indirect relevance to the Sex Discrimination Bill in that men and women are treated equally in all stages of procedure before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the Commission. Further , the Australian legal system does not treat women as second class citizens or give them a lesser right than men in relation to the capacity to maintain legal proceedings or enter into contractual or other legal relationships. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT ON THE THIRD READING OF THE SEX DISCRIMINATION BILL</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We, the undersigned, have determined to vote in support of the third reading of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. It has not been an easy decision and has been taken with a number of reservations. Nevertheless, we have reached our decision upon the following factors. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Opposition stands firmly against discrimination in any form, including discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy. Our stand on this Bill has never been directed to the objectives of the Bill but against the means adopted by the Government to attain those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Whilst the original Bill was an ill-considered and poorly drafted document, the Bill, in its present form, is workable and incorporates more than 53 changes ; those amendments in general having been made by the Government in response to representations by the Opposition and other interested individuals and organisations. The point is that the Government has come a long way down the road to accommodate legitimate objections to its original proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The freedom of religious schools will now be preserved. The Bill cannot now be used to force unwilling persons to participate in abortion procedures. The initial provisions infringing civil liberties have been removed. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) The debate generated by the Bill has indicated a number of areas of public concern as to the effect its implementation will have upon the structure of our society. Accordingly, it is pleasing to note that the Bill will not provide for affirmative action. Neither will the more unsatisfactory provisions of the UN Convention, for example the provision calling for supervision by a UN Committee, be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. While we are particularly concerned about the use of the external affairs power much of the Bill is based on other legitimate heads of Commonwealth power.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There should be no doubt that both Government and the Opposition regards this Bill as significant. In the light of that significance it may well be appropriate for a Parliamentary Committee to review its operation in a few years to ensure that the positive results hoped for are achieved and to see if further amendments are required to redirect the legislation to achieve those ends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make it perfectly clear that I will be voting against the third reading. I also want to make it perfectly clear that I am strongly against any discrimination against my sex or any other sex and against discrimination on the grounds of marital status or pregnancy, but I will not be intimidated by the name of the Bill. The Bill has been named the Sex Discrimination Bill. I do not believe in any discrimination, not merely discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy but also on religious grounds. I believe there is discrimination in this Bill against religious beliefs. It is for that reason, and also because of the use of the external affairs powers, that I will vote against the Bill. As I have said, I do not want to hold up the Senate. I make it perfectly clear to the Senate and to the Australian people that I am absolutely opposed, as strongly as anyone in the Senate, to discrimination against women, which is primarily what this Bill is about. But from the very beginning the intimidation by the Government that anyone who dared to speak out against this Bill was discriminating against women is, I believe, irresponsible. From the very beginning, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, Senator Ryan, has called people who opposed the Bill hysterical-that is the word that she so frequently used-yet she has brought into this place 80-odd amendments to the Bill that she brought forward. She will not tell me-even though she has had plenty of time, days, to do so-how many people signed a petition asking for amendments to the Bill. She has no intention of doing so. I will not be intimidated by the name of this Bill and I want that clearly understood by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in February 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I might indicate to the Senate why the Opposition wishes to see the Live -stock Slaughter (Export Inspection Charge) Validation Bill deferred until February-I thank the Australian Democrats for their support in this. The Bill is one which provides for an increase in the meat export inspection charge from $1. 80 to $5.40 per head. This matter has caused considerable difficulties in the industry, which has been going through a very difficult time, and there have been substantial representations to the Government. We want the Government to take time to consider the representations which have been made. In addition, there is the possibility of a legal challenge to some aspects of the charges and it is the wish of the Opposition that there be an opportunity for that matter to be considered and, if necessary, pursued. This is a slightly unusual course of action, Mr President, but I thought I should briefly explain to the Senate why it is we seek to consider this Bill when we return in February. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 December Senator Kilgariff asked me a question without notice about the Australian National Line's East Coast/Darwin shipping service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has advised me that the Australian Shipping Commission has advised the Northern Territory Government that because the $2 million Commonwealth subsidy for the Darwin/East Coast Service will be exhausted this month and because of the rate of loss being incurred, it proposes to give shippers one month's notice of termination of the service on 21 December. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Australian Shipping Commission indicated that it was prepared to continue the service while alternative arrangements are being finalised if the Northern Territory Government agreed to provide adequate financial support. The Commission also offered to provide the 'Townsville Trader ' on charter to the Northern Territory Government and/or operate it at that Government's risk and expense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the Territory Government has not replied to the Commission's proposals except to forward a copy of a press release which Mr Steele issued on 9 December. </PARA>
<PARA> In that press statement, Mr Steele again called on the Federal Government to continue supporting the service financially. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's position has been known to the Northern Territory since August. We provided a further $2 million assistance in the 1983 Budget on the understanding that this was to grant the Northern Territory Government time to decide whether to assist the continued operation of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made it quite clear that no further Federal subsidy will be made available. It is up to the Northern Territory Government, if it wishes the service to continue, to support the operations which exclusively serve the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate do now adjourn. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Government I want to say a few words as the Senate is now breaking up, as it were, for the Christmas period. For all honourable senators this has been a difficult year. A year in which an election takes place in March is a truncated parliamentary year. It has been a difficult year for the Government and, certainly from some expressions of aggro I have heard from the Opposition at various times, it has been a difficult year for the Opposition, too. Let me say that I understand exactly how it feels. I was a member of the Opposition for a long time. I take the opportunity to thank all honourable senators for the way in which they have handled the work of the Senate this year . Particularly, I thank you, Mr President. I think you have been a very fair President, and the business of the Senate has been run very well. I thank the Clerk of the Senate, his deputies, all the officers of the Senate and all of the attendants. There are probably many others I have forgotten, but I thank all those who have made this place as workable as politicians will allow it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there have been one or two quite special performances in the Senate this year. Senator Gareth Evans was accused of making an alteration to the Hansard but I think my colleague, Senator Grimes got away with that better than anybody else. I notice in one issue of the Hansard it is recorded that Senator Grimes is described as a 'spunk' by Senator Ryan. I sat here and I distinctly heard her say: 'You are a skunk'. The next day the Hansard appeared with that alteration in it. I also think Senator Primmer is to be congratulated for his unique interpretation of what 'non-controversial time' in the Senate means, and Senator Harradine for his marathon contribution to what is now the sex Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are many others who have contributed spectacular performances, particularly Senator Peter Baume and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for their understanding that brevity is the soul of wit and for the very concise and precise speeches they have made on a couple of issues in this last week. I like to think that I might join them in that category in time. All in all, it has been a difficult but I think productive year. I did single out three honourable senators-Senator Grimes, Senator Primmer and Senator Harradine-as those who have made quite outstanding and unique contributions to the work of the Senate. This brown paper parcel on my right, Mr President, contains three bags of James chocolates. If Senators Grimes, Primmer and Harradine will see me they will each get a bag of James chocolates to eat over Christmas. I wish everybody a happy Christmas on behalf of the Government and again make my personal thanks and good wishes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). If he thinks it has been a difficult year for the new Government, I can assure him it was a much more difficult year for the old one. It is just as well we are having Christmas greetings because if we were wishing people what we want for them in the New Year I would have to say that I hope the Government will have an equally difficult year in 1984 as we had in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I wish to thank you and all of those many people who work under you for the work you have done for us during the year. I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in thanking you for the way you have conducted the presidency, which I think has been fair and forthright-qualities which we expect in a President and which we, on the other hand, are always grateful to receive when they are delivered. We thank you for that and we thank all of your officers , from the Clerk onwards, and all of the staff of this place who put up with us. It is a quite extraordinary thing-I am not sure whether it is the effect of Christmas being a week away or the adjournment motion-but suddenly the horns have disappeared from Senator Button's head. I am only sorry that Senator Gareth Evans is not here because it would have been much more challenging to see whether the horns had disappeared from his head also. However, he is away with the other Attorneys-General. I would just like to say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that we do not really miss Senator Evans because the lack of tact and diplomacy displayed by Senator Button over the last few minutes , when he suggested that Senator Ryan called Senator Grimes a skunk, was worthy of Senator Evans. I really feel that he is here with us in the chamber in spirit if not in body. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, again we extend our best wishes to all of those who work in this place. I hope that everybody has the sort of Christmas which is the stuff of our mythology and of our society and that everybody has as good a time with their families as I am intending to have with mine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr President, I endorse the comments of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney). I think there is always something of a fascination around Christmas time in the way that in this chamber the fire and brimstone of yesterday suddenly becomes peace and goodwill as we draw Christmas into our sights. I just hope that the season that follows us when we leave this chamber today, and next year, 1984, are happy periods for all of us and that we have health, strength and peace around us. Certainly, on behalf of my Party, I thank you, Mr President, for your very fine occupancy of the Chair during the year. I wish you a happy Christmas and a fine New Year. To the Clerks at the table, who have shown their great capacities and given help, to the skilful and tolerant people of Hansard, to the attendants and the other staff and, finally, to our colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I wish a happy Christmas and a bright and healthy 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I endorse the comments of Senators Button, Chaney and Scott and thank everybody associated with this place for the assistance that they have given us. It has been a pretty rugged year. I said to my wife the other day: 'Hasn't the year gone quickly'. She said 'Good heavens, how can you say that because we had an election in March'. All of a sudden, I was stunned to think that it was this year that we had the election and that a new government was elected. That seems an enternity ago to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats hold the balance of power in this chamber and that has made life very difficult for us. We are occasionally accused by the Liberal Party of being an extension of the Australian Labor Party. In turn, we are accused by the Labor Party of being an extension of the Liberal Party. It just pleases me that the number of accusations from each of these quarters seems to be the same. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can single out one group in particular I single out the Clerk and everybody in the Department of the Senate, who do an extraordinary job. I know that you, Mr President, are very proud, as you should be, to have such people on your staff. I make the point that 169 Bills have been presented by the Government since March of which only four have been rejected. This means that 98 per cent of the Government's legislative program has been passed without impairment. In addition to that, we have moved over 70 amendments to Bills. We received assistance in respect of every one of those amendments from your Clerks . </PARA>
<PARA> That assistance has been provided always in a willing, courteous and extremely efficient manner. In addition, we received assistance in respect of the dozen or so private members' Bills that we introduced. I thank them especially. I take this opportunity on behalf of the Democrats of wishing all honourable senators and their loved ones a happy and holy Christmas. </PARA>

I also mention that much of the examination of legislation at the Committee stage would not have been possible with such efficiency if it had not been for the work of Senator Hamer, the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. The honourable senator is extraordinarily quick. He seems to be able to detect when people are about to rise-he has not missed anybody yet. I certainly have missed speaking to one clause of a Bill because of his efficiency and the gentle speed with which he announces the various clauses. I must say that his work has been appreciated by the chamber, especially at the Committee of the Whole stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

In addition, I thank the attendants and the Senate transport officers who are probably waiting to ship some people off, although I am probably the only senator who is going to stay in Canberra over night. I really put my faith in the notice of motion put down by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) that we would meet tomorrow. It has been a long day. I very much thank the attendants. Maybe, like me and the rest of us, they have not had any lunch today. Maybe they are like me and have not had any breakfast today.

I include those who have helped arrange my travel, people in the Government Printing Office and areas like that who have been most helpful to me, the attendants who, except on one occasion, have delivered everything I have required within a reasonable length of time and the people in the Bills and Papers Office, with whom I was perhaps a little rough yesterday. I thank particularly the Hansard staff who this year have worked during dinner hours and at times when they should not really be expected to work. I think that next year we will have to look at the pressures we apply to the staff around the place, not just members of both Houses.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth assistance to rental tenants currently takes the form of assistance to the States to increase the availability of public rental accommodation and direct assistance to persons renting privately.</PARA>
<PARA> I announced in my May economic statement a significant increase in assistance for public housing. Assistance under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement is being increased in 1983-84 to $500m-an increase of $167m, or 50 per cent on the $333m provided in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> Direct assistance to persons renting privately is being provided</PARA>
<PARA> through supplementary rental assistance to eligible pensioners-estimated cost $ 164m in 1982-83; and</PARA>
<PARA> through assistance under the mortgage and rent relief scheme, under which the Commonwealth has agreed to provide up to $20m per annum for a period of three years from 1982-83 provided this sum is matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that this assistance is better targeted to persons in need in the private rental market than the provision of a means-tested income tax rebate to all persons renting privately, and is accordingly a preferred method of assistance at a time of very difficult budgetary circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has terminated the universal home loan interest tax rebate for owner-occupiers, which the former Government introduced in August 1982, and confined the benefit of the tax rebate scheme for first home buyers to lower income earners who occupied their first home before 1 October 1983. Once again, these measures give effect to the Government's policy of directing housing assistance to those most in need.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The growth rate of M3 expressed on a twelve-months-to basis decreased from 12.4 per cent in March to 11.7 per cent in April 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Most short term interest rates decreased appreciably during the March-April period. For example, the 90-day bank accepted/endorsed commercial bill rate fell from 17.0 per cent at end-February to 12.65 per cent at end-April. Medium and long term secondary market Treasury Bond rates also fell during this period. For example, secondary market yields on five year Treasury bonds fell about three- quarters of a percentage point between end-February and end-April.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Treasurer did announce a $1,500m bond tender on 19 May 1983. The settlement dates for the tender were 30 May to 24 June, so that its impact on the money supply would have been reflected in the June and later figures. The growth rate of M3 was 11.2 per cent over the 12 months to May 1983 but 12.5 per cent over the 12 months to June 1983. This outcome was influenced by several factors, including foreign exchange inflows, the Budget surplus, and the transactions of the Reserve Bank and private banks, as well as by Government financing transactions. Nevertheless, the tender announced on 19 May would have contributed to a lower monetary growth in June than if the tender had been smaller.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Immediately following the tender announcement on 19 May, most short term rates and secondary market Treasury bond yields rose, continuing a trend evident over the previous week. A decline in hedged overseas borrowing costs and substantial foreign exchange inflows in subsequent days resulted in short term rates declining to levels only slightly above their pre-tender announcement levels by the start of the settlement period on 30 May. In contrast, secondary market bond yields at the beginning of the settlement period remained at the higher post-announcement levels, although this can by no means be attributed solely to the tender.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Did the Treasurer say in his economic statement of 19 May 1983 that monetary growth at 12 per cent 'is not consistent with this Government's objectives'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What was the rate of growth in M1 and M3 in the year to March 1983 and did the rate of growth in M3 exceed that of M1.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does M3 include bank deposits on which market rates of interest are paid and does this not mean that banks can offer high interest rates when liquidity is tight so as to offset Government's attempt to control the money supply with open market operations.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) What was the real rate of growth in M1 in the year to March 1983.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The growth rates of M1 and M3 in the twelve months to March 1983 were 1.8 per cent and 12.4 per cent respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The volume of money measure M3 includes trading bank fixed deposits and certificates of deposit as well as savings bank investment accounts and statement savings accounts on which market or near-market interest rates are paid. Open market operations involving the sale of additional Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank sector by the Reserve Bank have the effect of reducing the overall volume of funds available to the banking system as deposits.</PARA>
<PARA> One response of the banks to such operations could be an increase in their deposit rates designed to limit their loss of deposits. However, such action by itself is unlikely to offset fully the lower deposit growth resulting from the open market operations. This is because the increase in bank deposit rates will need to be reflected in bank lending rates and, as these increase, it is reasonable to expect that there will be an increasing reluctance by borrowers from banks to pay the higher interest rates. Faced with the consequent fall-off in demand for borrowings, the banks' ability to offer higher interest rates will be necessarily inhibited and, hence, so will be the banks' ability to offset fully the open market operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No single measure is adequate on its own for measuring the liquidity of the financial system. An accurate assessment of monetary and liquidity conditions can only be reached after considering a wide range of financial indicators. For example, the M1 aggregate needs to be interpreted with particular caution at present since the relatively high nominal interest rates on most interest bearing bank deposits and other financial assets have resulted in individuals economising on balances held in cheque accounts. As these cheque accounts are included in M1, this aggregate has therefore grown more slowly recently than most other financial aggregates and accordingly does not reflect the easier liquidity conditions more generally.</PARA>
<PARA> All measures of monetary and liquidity conditions-including M3-are subject to a variety of structural and cyclical influences that must be taken into account in assessing their effectiveness in portraying monetary conditions. The choice of one monetary aggregate over another as a better measure of monetary conditions must ultimately reflect a judgment as to the relative disadvantages and advantages of each aggregate. In this regard, M3 appears to be more representative of general monetary conditions, less susceptible to short-term volatility and has a greater level of community understanding than M1. It is considered a more appropriate summary measure of monetary conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Real growth rates of monetary and other aggregates are dependent on the choice of the price deflator used in the calculation. Based on movements in the Consumer Price Index, the real movement of M1 in the twelve months to March 1983 was minus 8.7 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The income tax law allows a self-employed person or an employee without employer-sponsored superannuation support an income tax deduction for his or her contributions to a qualifying superannuation fund up to an annual limit of $1, 200. Benefits from such a superannuation fund, to the extent to which they are referable on a time basis to membership of the fund after 30 June 1983, will be subject to the new taxing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The honourable senator seems to be asking why income tax deductions available for contributions to a supperannuation fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee can be much higher than the deduction for such contributions available to an employee who has to make his or her own superannuation arrangements. The former contributions are, of course, deductible to the employer as part of the overall remuneration payable in respect of the employment of the employee, are part of the costs of derivation of the employer' s income and are funded in accordance with guidelines which reflect the employer -employee relationship. The latter contributions have no direct relationship to the derivation of the taxpayer's income and the deduction of up to $1,200 represents a concession under the income tax law which would not otherwise be available to assist unsupported employees and self-employed persons to provide for retirement. As the honourable senator would know, the level of concessions of this nature under the income tax law are subject to budgetary considerations.</PARA>

<PARA> Following the announcement in the Government's economic statement of 19 May 1983 concerning new arrangements for taxing lump sum benefits, preliminary discussions were held with representatives of the life insurance and superannuation industries on a number of related issues, including the sale of annuities. The Statement which the Treasurer issued jointly with the Australian Council of Trade Unions on 15 August 1983, foreshadowed a continuation of discussions with the ACTU, the Confederation of Australian Industry and other interested parties including the superannuation industry, with the objective of developing a national retirement package. It also indicated that the operation of annuities will be subject to further consideration. The question of issuing Commonwealth indexed securities raises a number of substantial and complex issues. It was against this background that the Martin group, which was established to review aspects of the Australian financial system, was specifically asked to give priority consideration to this issue. The Treasurer has received an interim report by the Martin group on this subject and it is being considered by the Government. Any governmental discussions with industry on this subject will be considered after the Government has decided its basic policies on the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The registration of tax agents is controlled by independent tax agents' boards constituted under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Registration and cancellation of registration are, under the existing law, matters for decision by those Boards.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax agents' boards review registration of an agent if a complaint is received. In this regard they may cancel registration where it is considered that an agent has been guilty of misconduct as a tax agent or is not a fit and proper person to remain registered. In addition, each registered agent is required to apply annually for continuation of his or her registration and the boards may refuse to re-register a person whom they consider is unfit to continue practising as a tax agent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A requirement that the full details of all purchases of rural land by foreign interests be released would represent a significant departure from the approach presently taken in relation to information supplied in confidence by parties to foreign investment proposals. The Government and the Foreign Investment Review Board rely on the co-operation of parties for the supply of commercial information necessary for the effective consideration of proposals. This co- operation would be endangered if the confidentiality of such information could no longer be assured.</PARA>
<PARA> I would draw the honourable senator's attention to the fact that the Government has continued the established practice of ensuring that a rural property has been publicly advertised or otherwise made clearly available for purchase by Australians before giving consideration to a foreign investment proposal for its acquisition. The Government has also continued the practice of publicly announcing decisions on major or otherwise significant proposals after consultation with the parties involved. Decisions by this Government on proposals involving rural property interests which have been made public are:</PARA>
<PARA> a proposal by Wallcreek Trust to acquire land at Noosa and Tewantin, Queensland (further information is provided in the Treasurer's statement of 22 April 1983);</PARA>
<PARA> a proposal by Nchima Tea and Tung Estates Ltd to acquire shares in Iota Pty Ltd , a predominantly United Kingdom-owned company with rural property interests in Western Australia (the Treasurer's statement of 21 July 1983 refers);</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is no new tax on cosmetics containing sunscreen agents. Cosmetics have been taxable for many years. However, prior to the August 1983 Budget various cosmetics had gained exemption under a provision conferring exemption on sunscreen preparations by having included in the ingredients of the cosmetics a sunscreen agent. Notwithstanding the inclusion of the sunscreen agent the products remain essentially cosmetics. The effect of the Budget amendment made to the exemption provision (item 38A in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax ( Exemptions and Classifications) Act) is to exclude cosmetics with sunscreen agents from exemption and to tax them at the same rate as other cosmetics. The exemption for sunscreen preparations has, ever since it was introduced, been dependent on the effectiveness of the preparations in screening out solar ultra- violet rays. The exemption has also been dependent on the manner in which the product is put up for sale.</PARA>
<PARA> Sunscreen preparations which are not essentially cosmetics but which are effective and are put up for sale for the purpose of screening out solar ultra- violet rays remain exempt from sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Cosmetics, cosmetic preparations and goods in the nature of cosmetic preparations are now excluded from exemption and are taxed even though they might have a sunscreen agent in them which effectively screens out solar ultra- violet rays. It is not proposed to amend the law to exempt night preparations. The Government has excluded the cosmetics, et cetera. with sunscreen agents for exemption because they are essentially cosmetics and should bear the same rate of sales tax as other cosmetics.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has never intended to exempt cosmetics. It is concerned that cosmetics which include sunscreen agents, even those with effective sunscreen agents, should not gain a competitive advantage over other cosmetics because of sales tax. The Government continues to encourage the use of sunscreen preparations as such by exempting those which effectively screen out solar ultra -violet rays.</PARA>

<PARA> The part of the question which related to the tax deductions for election expenses has been referred to the Treasurer, who has supplied the following reply:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation whom I consulted on this matter has informed me that statistics of income tax deductions for election expenses are not available .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 September 1983 (Hansard, page 525), Senator Jessop asked the Minister for Social Security a question without notice concerning the Government 's new taxation arrangements for lump sum superannuation and kindred benefits. In responding to him Senator Grimes indicated, inter alia, that he would pass the question on to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance for any additional comment which they might like to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has now provided the following response in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that most lump sums received by individuals are relatively small and such lump sums would only purchase modest annuities. However, the average size of lump sums received by genuine retirees, which is the group for which the annuity option is relevant, would be significantly higher than the figures quoted by Senator Jessop which related to lump sums received both prior to and at genuine retirement from the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government's new tax arrangements for lump sums will not in any way compel lump sum recipients to take annuities on retirement nor will they provide any special tax inducements to take this course of action. Under the new measures, on retirement, a lump sum recipient will have two choices. First, he can take his lump sum and pay tax on it (generally at 15 per cent after the transitional provisions have worked their way through). Alternatively he can roll the lump sum over into a pension or annuity in which case tax on the lump sum will be deferred by the individual until received as part of his regular stream of pension or annuity payments at which time it will (after the transitional provisions no longer operate) generally be taxed according to the rates applying under the ordinary income tax rate scale. The new arrangements have been designed with the aim of making the effective tax burdens approximately equivalent under either alternative, so that those persons who choose not to convert their lump sum into a pension or annuity will not be disadvantaged.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the first part of the question was given on 21 September 1983 ( Hansard, page 855). The Treasurer has supplied the following answer to the second part of the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget forecast of an increase in the consumer price index, in 1983-84 of about 7 1/2 per cent included an estimate of the effect of increases in State taxes and public authority charges announced prior to the Budget (mainly in Western Australia and South Australia). It also included some general-and necessarily rough-allowance for increases in State taxes and charges which, on the basis of past experience, might have been expected to be announced in the State budgets.</PARA>
<PARA> The increases in taxes and charges that have been announced in the State budgets suggest a slightly larger contribution to the consumer price index than allowed for in the Budget forecasts as, in general, the States have chosen to increase expenditure-and hence their taxation levels-somewhat more than had been assumed in those forecasts. However, given all other uncertainties, the difference is not sufficient to warrant a change to the Budget-time consumer price index forecast.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September 1983 (Hansard, page 964) Senator Chaney asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the effects on Budget revenues of subsequent changes or revisions to measures that were originally announced in the Budget. In my answer, I indicated that reductions to that time in Budget revenue estimates were in the vicinity of $80m . I undertook to get more accurate figures from the Treasurer. Since that time, the honourable senator will be aware that the Senate has rejected the Government 's Budget proposals to achieve further recovery of evaded tax in 'bottom of the harbour' cases, at a cost to revenue of $60m in 1983-84 and $270m in total.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The sales tax amendments in respect of piping and tubing used in buildings, to which the honourable senator referred, were merely to clarify the Government's original intentions in this area. Consequently, the amendments will have no effect on Budget revenue estimates.'</PARA>
<PARA> In my earlier response to the honourable senator, I indicated that the excise rate on fortifying spirit applying up to 1970 was $2.00 per litre, and that the present value equivalent to that rate would be in the vicinity of $8.00 per litre. The Treasurer has drawn my attention to the fact that the excise on fortifying spirit in 1970 was 15.4 cents per litre of alcohol, which would imply a present value on this excise of about 60 cents per litre of alcohol.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="4025" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September 1983 (Hansard, page 963), Senator Zakharov asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which I address to the Minister representing the Treasurer, concerns the granting of sales tax exemptions for goods bought for use by public benevolent institutions. The Commissioner of Taxation has ruled, on the basis of High Court decisions, that an organisation is not a public benevolent institution unless it has as its dominant objective, both in constituting documents and in practice, the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, destitution or helplessness. His interpretation is that these criteria rule out counselling and referral centres such as citizens advice bureaux. Since such centres do, in fact, relieve suffering, distress and helplessness and assist people to obtain relief from poverty, destitution and sickness, it would seem the ruling is based on an outmoded view that 'relief' means the direct provision of material relief. . . . My question is:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Will the Government take action to remove this anomaly which denies sales tax exemption for essential equipment for vital community services?'</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that exemption from sales tax for purchases by non-profit community organisations, including citizens advice bureaux, depends on whether the organisations qualify as public benevolent institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner confirmed that High Court decisions have established that an organisation is not a public benevolent institution unless it has as its dominant objective, both in its constituting documents and in practice, the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune or helplessness. It is a question of fact in each case whether a particular organisation qualifies as a public benevolent institution.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner does not hold the view that counselling and the giving of advice can never be activities of a benevolent nature in the sense established by the High Court. There are, however, many organisations which provide worthwhile community and welfare services. Such organisations may provide to members of the public generally welfare and community services such as counselling, referral and educational services in problems in certain areas, for example marriage, law, health and employment. These services certainly meet a community and social need and, indeed, in many instances are financed by Government grants and have Government support in other ways. Nevertheless, their activities are not necessarily directed to the relief of persons suffering poverty, misfortune, distress, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the law would be required to extend sales tax concessions to counselling and referral centres, such as citizens advice bureaux. Such a question would need to be examined in the context of the competing claims made by many other kinds of non-profit community organisations whose activities are also worthy, but which are not at present eligible for exemption.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 November 1983 (Hansard page 3008) Senator Chaney asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a question without notice concerning a strike by Electrical Trades Union members in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The dispute was resolved recently following acceptance by the striking workers of a decision by the Western Australian Industrial Commission awarding electrical tradesmen employed under the State Electrical Contracting Industry Award an increase of $20 a week. That increase incorporates a flow on of the 4.3 per cent National Wage increase. Work resumed on 9 December 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The dispute concerned a claim by Electrical Trades Union members employed under the State Award seeking payment of increases totalling $38 per week, which were provided for under an agreement entered into in 1981. That agreement had been ratified by the Western Australian Industrial Commission in 1981. However, increases due in January and July of this year were deferred by the Western Australian Industrial Commission in the context of the wages pause which was then in place. Following the National Wage Case decision of 23 September, the Western Australian Industrial Commission, like all State Industrial Commissions, adopted the terms of the new centralised system. There was therefore only limited scope for the original agreement to be implemented after the wages pause ended.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government was, throughout the dispute, extremely concerned at the industrial action being taken by some Electrical Trades Union members in Western Australia. The economic implications of the union's claim, if successful, were of great concern to the Government, as was the impact on employment of a continuation of industrial action. In that context I discussed the dispute with my Western Australian counterpart, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Dans, on a number of occasions. However, as the dispute concerned employees employed under a State Award, the matter was finally one to be resolved under the processes of conciliation and arbitration established under Western Australian legislation. That has now happened.</PARA>

<PARA> (6) Broadcasting policy in Australia is based on the principle that the electro -magnetic spectrum is a scarce national resource and is public property. There is, however, no statutory requirement for the ABC to publicise the amount of time allocated to community service announcements although the ABC is obliged to supply information for answers to questions asked by members of parliament. The ABC is not obliged to broadcast any community service announcements, although it could be construed that a blanket ABC refusal to broadcast such announcements would be inconsistent with its charter. Commercial radio and television stations are publicly accountable through the licence renewal process, administered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Before the Tribunal may grant or renew a licence, applicants have a statutory obligation to undertake to provide 'an adequate and comprehensive service' in pursuance of the licence.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See answer to (4).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is the appropriate body to collect and publicise information concerning broadcast community service announcements. In its 1982-83 Annual Report, the Tribunal included an aggregate figure, provided by the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, on the value of time provided free of charge by commercial radio stations for community service announcements. I understand that the Tribunal will endeavour to obtain similar information on this matter from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations for inclusion in future Annual Reports. At licence renewal inquiries, many commercial radio and television stations provide detailed information on the amount of time donated to, and the organisations benefited by , community service announcements.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am aware that on 21 December 1982 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce asked the Department to develop procedures to prevent transfer of tender quota holdings which had clearly been acquired for speculative purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 27 April 1983 Australian Customs Notice No. 83-81 set down procedures to restrict quota speculation. The text of that Notice is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The 1984 tender quota scheme will provide for limits to quota transferability in that not more than 20 per cent of a tender quota holding in a category may be freely transferred.</PARA>
<PARA> 'If a genuine importer wishes to transfer an amount of tender quota in excess of 20 per cent of quota held in a category, it will be necessary to produce substantive evidence that the quota was originally acquired to meet an importing program which has since changed.</PARA>
<PARA> 'The restriction on transferability of tender quota is specifically aimed at traders who seek to acquire quota for speculative purposes. Genuine importers will face a minimum of inconvenience from the measures, whereas transfers in excess of 20 per cent of the holdings of quota speculators will be refused.</PARA>
<PARA> 'Prospective tenderers should carefully note that they will be required to give an undertaking that they will both import and enter the goods covered by the quota. TENDER QUOTA IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ENTER FOR HOME CONSUMPTION, GOODS WHICH WERE IMPORTED BY A PARTY OTHER THAN THE TENDER QUOTA HOLDER.'</PARA>
<PARA> The constraints on transferability of tender quota have not been applied to 1983 quota allocations as to do so would represent a substantial change to the basis on which the tender was conducted-in mid 1982-and quota allocated. It is therefore not possible at this time to answer the second part of this question relating to the success of the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in the course of its discussion program last September and October the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Advisory Committee received comments from importing interests which would suggest that measures taken in relation to speculation in, and leasing of quota had been effective in containing these practices. Quantifiable evidence of the effectiveness of these measures is not available.</PARA>

<PARA> What action, if any, have Australian governments taken to implement recommendations 1 to 26 of the report of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry Inquiry (the Ralph Report) and the suggestions relating thereto.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4030" SPEAKER="Grimes Sen The Hon D.J." NAMEID="9V4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator Grimes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the publication of the Ralph Report in 1979 various actions have been taken to implement the recommendations. In August 1980 a Joint Press Statement was made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Rt Hon. Philip Lynch, and the then Minister for Health, the Hon. M. J. R. MacKellar, outlining their Government's decisions in this matter. In addition a document entitled Ralph Inquiry Into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry issued by the Department of Health on 19 August 1980 sets out each of the Inquiry's recommendations and the Government's decision on each recommendation. A copy of this document has been placed in the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards Recommendation 1 of the Report as noted in the Joint Press Statement the then Government decided that the present pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS ) drug pricing arrangements were to stay in operation for the present pending further consideration of the complex issues involved, with a view to a decision in 1981. At the same time an 'across-the-board' price increase of 20 cents per prescription at price to chemist level was granted, to be effective on 1 November 1980. In August 1981 the Government decided to retain the existing PBS drug pricing arrangements and granted a further 'across-the-board' price increase effective on 1 November 1981. The question of implementing changes to the PBS drug pricing arrangements was again under consideration in August 1982 when a further 'across-the-board' increase-effective 1 November 1982-was announced. However, no changes to the PBS drug pricing arrangements had been introduced by the March 1983 election.</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Press Statement and the document issued by the Department of Health indicated that action would be taken in respect of Recommendation 7; namely, the introduction of legislation to allow chemists to 'discount' the patient contribution. This decision was rescinded in a news release (70/80) from the Hon . M. J. R. MacKellar on 21 August 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to Recommendation 11 and the subsequent decision to appoint at least one economic adviser to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), Mr John Brooks was appointed and attended his first PBAC meeting in February 1981. This initial appointment was for a trial period of one year. Mr Brooks was subsequently appointed for a further trial period of two years. This trial period has not yet been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the election of the present Government in March 1983, preliminary discussions on pharmaceutical benefits drug price arrangements have been held with representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. A detailed submission on this matter has now been received from the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and a submission is expected shortly from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. It is the Government's intention to establish an Interdepartmental Committee to examine the submissions and I hope to make a statement on this subject in the Autumn sittings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1983 (Hansard, page 2759) Senator Coates asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) a question without notice about a statement by the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd, Mr Leslie, concerning the numbers of public servants and people from this Parliament using Qantas for their travel. Senator Button responded to the question but undertook to obtain from the relevant Minister a comment on the figures quoted by Mr Leslie for usage of Qantas by public servants and parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) as the responsible Minister has provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not maintain statistics on the use of Qantas by members of Parliament or public servants. The Government has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statistics quoted by the Chairman of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA> In elaboration of the comments made by Senator Button in his preliminary response to Senator Coates' question I wish to record the fact that Finance Directions require Qantas services to be used on all occasions where available flights meet requirements for official travel at Commonwealth expense by Commonwealth public servants travelling overseas. The Directions also require that where suitable flights are not available, preference be given to services of airlines with which Qantas has revenue pooling arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 November 1983 (Hansard, page 2249) Senator Bjelke- Petersen asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is to the Attorney-General. I refer him to a report in the Australian newspaper last week in which it was stated that a Mr Peter Niarros, a boilermaker at Mount Newman, was receiving bomb threats and was to be dismissed following his refusal to pay $20 to a union strike fund. In view of this blatant violation of Mr Niarros's human rights, will the Attorney refer his case urgently to the Human Rights Commission for immediate investigation and action? In view of the Attorney's much flaunted belief in human rights, will he give an unequivocal assurance that the human rights legislation will extend to those unions which have shown on many occasions that they will not hesitate to use standover tactics, including bomb threats and abusive phone calls, to violate the human rights and liberties of those people in our community who will not bow to their demands?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first part of the honourable senator's question, I should mention that the complaint handling function of the Human Rights Commission relates to acts and practices engaged in by or on behalf of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority, or in a Territory, or under Commonwealth or Territory law. There is, I think, a question whether the action taken against Mr Niarros referred to by the honourable senator is an act or practice of that kind. However, if it appears to Mr Niarros that the matter may be within the Commission's functions, his appropriate course would be to take up the matter with the Commission by lodging a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the honourable senator's question, as I indicated in my earlier answer, the content of the proposed Bill of Rights will be made public when the Bill is introduced early in the autumn session.</PARA>
