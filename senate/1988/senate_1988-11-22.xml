<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances at its last meeting considered correspondence received from the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mr Punch), the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support undertook to bring forward provisions in the Civil Aviation Regulations to describe various forms of service, and to tighten the requirements of proof of identity. The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support also advised that the provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations were re-drafted from previous provisions, now repealed. The Committee considers that re-statement of previous provisions does not preclude the Committee's scrutiny and I have written to the Minister in these terms. The Minister agreed, however, to an amendment requiring authorised persons to carry identification. The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business assured the Committee that a refusal of permission to export certain ships and aircraft will be on defence and foreign policy grounds, made by the Minister personally, and therefore should not be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The Minister for Community Services and Health provided the Committee with copies of `important notes', not previously seen by the Committee and undertook to arrange for an explanation of the expression `due enquiry' to be included in the `important notes'. The Committee thanks the Minister for his cooperation in this matter. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief description of the scrutiny of the Committee and its correspondence.</PARA>

<PARA>Summary of Scrutiny</PARA>
<PARA> Civil Aviation Regulations as contained in Statutory Rules No. 158 of 1988 and made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> This regulation covers civil aviation regulatory matters consequential upon the transfer of functions to the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the form of service used for notification of decisions to certain persons, the need for ``authorised persons'' to carry and produce adequate proof of identity, and whether ``the approved form'' referred to forms which are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications provided an explanation and undertook to bring forward statutory rules to describe the forms of service. The Minister agreed to tighten existing provisions requiring authorised persons to carry proof of identity. The Minister assured the Committee that in ``the approved form'' refers only to classes of information such as experience and qualifications, to be provided by applicants for licences.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Air Navigation Regulations (Amendment) as contained in Statutory Rules No. 159 of 1988 and made under the Air Navigation Act 1920.</PARA>
<PARA> These regulations repeal redundant regulations and provide a number of amendments relating to non-safety elements of aviation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wrote to the Minister for Transport and Communications, expressing the Committee's concerns about the lack of review of discretionary decisions made by the Secretary, and the need for authorised persons to wear appropriate identification if required to discharge firearms at airports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister advised that the previous regulations allowed for review of decisions regarding personal licences, but controls provided in these regulations relate to international air services and enable Australia to meet its international obligations. The Minister agreed to an amendment requiring authorised persons to carry proof of identity.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations (Amendment) as contained in Statutory Rules No. 195 of 1988 and made under the Customs Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA> These regulations repeal redundant regulations and prevent the export of ships and aircraft without ministerial consent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern related to discretions given to the Minister, described in the explanatory notes as bringing those provisions in line with similar provisions recently introduced in the Regulations, as the Committee found no reference to ``the similar provisions recently introduced into the Regulations'', and to the lack of review on the merits in relation to the exercise of ministerial discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business explained the background to the amendment. The Minister also explained that as denials of permission to export will be on defence and foreign policy grounds with decisions made personally by the Minister, ministerial discretion will not be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Committee accepted the advice.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Application for Approved Pathology Practitioners Status Form APP3-A made under section 23dc of the Health Insurance Act 1953 and Application for Approved Pathology Authority Status Form APA3-A made under section 23df of the Health Insurance Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA> APP3-A and APA3-A deal with the giving of undertakings on forms of applications to providers of pathology services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee commented that the ``Important Notes'' were not supplied to assist the Committee in its scrutiny, and requested inclusion of such additional information. The Committee's concern also related to the use of the phrase ``after due inquiry'' and degree of ``due inquiry'' required.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health provided the ``Important Notes'' for the Committee's consideration, and undertook to arrange for an explanation of the expression ``due enquiry'' to be included in the ``Important Notes''.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Transport and Communications</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered Civil Aviation Regulations being Statutory Rules 1988 No. 158 and tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee draws the following matters to your attention.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, in relation to the notification of decisions made under, for example, Regulations 26 (4), 44 (2), 45 (2), 85 and 281 (4) the provisions state that notification of decisions can be served by post on the person or otherwise brought to his or her attention. This latter phrase is unfamiliar to the Committee and the Committee believes that it could lead to considerable problems and potential disputes about proof. The Committee seeks your guidance concerning this phrase and queries whether any criteria have been devised to ensure that the rights of the person receiving notification in this form are being protected.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in many of these Regulations there are acts to be carried out by ``an authorised person''. (See, for example, Regulations 2 (1), 30 (4), 33 (2), 35, 36, 38 (5), 47 (1), (3) and (4), 48 (3), 49, 53 (1) and (3), 54 (3), 227, 302 and 305.) The Committee is concerned that there are no provisions requiring ``an authorised person'' to carry and produce appropriate proof of identity.</PARA>
<PARA> Where it is merely ``an authorised person'' acting on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority to give written approvals in an office it may not create too much difficulty. However, where ``an authorised person'' comes on to maintenance areas to inspect (Regulation 30 (4)), or seeks admission to an aircrew compartment (Regulation 227 (3)), or seeks access to an aerodrome or aircraft (Regulation 305), there is potential for very considerable danger of sabotage or harm arising from the entry of an imposter. The Committee believes that, in such cases, proper identity cards should be issued and required to be shown before the authorised person has access to such areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in Regulation 298, a reference is made to ``the approved form'' and in Regulation 2 (1) the Committee notes that ``approved'' means ``approved by the Authority''. The Committee is concerned that, as such approval forms may include substantial and important documents, there does not appear to be any provision in the regulations which subjects these ``forms'' to Parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> Your comments and advice in relation to these matters will be welcomed by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the letter of 30 August 1988, addressed to Senator Evans, concerning the Committee's scrutiny of the Civil Aviation Regulations, being Statutory Rules 1988, No. 158.</PARA>
<PARA> You have queried the fact that various notifications under the Regulations may be served on a person by post or otherwise brought to his or her attention. The normal method of serving the notices is by post. However, at times a written notice is personally served on the person or the person's agent. In rare instances a written notice may be prominently attached to an unairworthy aircraft because of the impossibility of effecting service in any other way. This practice complies with the spirit of sections 28A and 29 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and has so far been considered an adequate way of serving notifications or directions in all manner of practical situations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the flexibility of such arrangements be retained. However, if the Committee continues to have doubts about the wording, I would be happy to bring forward in due course further Statutory Rules that would describe the various methods of service. An example of such description is in the Air Navigation Regulations where subregulation 215B (3), as remade by Statutory Rules 1988 No. 159, provides for service by the methods described above.</PARA>
<PARA> You also queried identification of authorised persons. As a matter of practice, identification is carried and produced by an officer of the Civil Aviation Authority who is appointed an authorised person and is carrying out activities related to such appointment away from the Authority's premises.</PARA>
<PARA> A second category of authorised persons is that within the industry, consisting of persons who are appointed to enable them to give particular approvals. Such persons are supplied with instruments of appointment to verify their authority. In most instances the person is readily identifiable because of the position held in a firm or other organisation performing maintenance or testing work.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sympathetic to your concern that all authorised persons should, ideally, be required to carry proof of identification. Accordingly, I shall arrange for the drafting of Statutory Rules aimed at tightening the provisions currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The phrase ``in the approved form'' in Regulation 298 has been taken as referring to classes of information, such as experience and qualifications, which an applicant for a licence should provide. The regulation has not been used as the basis for design of a form to be completed by applicants.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered Air Navigation Regulations (Amendment), being Statutory Rules 1988 No. 159 and tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee draws the following matters to your attention.</PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 13 of the amending Regulations inserts into the Principal Regulation new Regulations 191 to 197. Within these provisions are contained a number of discretions which are vested in the Secretary, for example, the issue of licences (Regulation 191), approval of flights (Regulation 192), form and consolidation of licences (Regulation 193), duration, renewal and review of licences (Regulation 194), cancellation or suspension of licences (Regulation 195) and contracts and arrangements for non-licence holders to allow another to operate their services (Regulation 196).</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern is that, in dealing with these very important commercial matters and decisions, the Secretary's discretion does not appear to be subject to any review procedures. Part XV of the Principal Regulations use to confer appropriate review rights but with the repeal of that Part by Regulation 16 of these Regulations there appears to the Committee to be a gap in the Principal Regulations as they now stand. Your advice and assistance in relation to this important matter would be appreciated by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 23 inserts new Regulation 315b, which relates to aircraft parking areas, into the Principal Regulations. This new provision also contains a number of discretionary decisions to be made by the Secretary. Again no apparent avenues of review exist in relation to this Regulation and the Committee also seeks your assistance and advice in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 22 inserts new Regulation 315aa, which relates to the prohibition of the discharge of firearms at airports except by certain classes of persons, into the Principal Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> Subregulation 315aa (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``An authorised person may, for a purpose relating to aviation security, discharge a firearm upon or over any part of a Federal airport.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's concern is that such an authorised person is not required to produce or wear any form of identification. While it is unlikely that anyone would challenge a person discharging a firearm at an aerodrome and demand an identity card, it would probably be sensible to require such an authorised person to have a proper identity card in the course of carrying out his or her duties.</PARA>
<PARA> Your comments in relation to these matters will be welcomed by the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the letter of 30 August 1988, addressed to Senator Evans, concerning the Air Navigation Regulations (Amendment), being Statutory Rules 1988, No. 159.</PARA>
<PARA> The licensing scheme provided for in regulations 191 to 197 is not new. The regime of control is precisely the same as before, but the provisions were recast by Attorney-General's Department when amendments to the Regulations were being drafted in relation to abandonment of the scheme of domestic air service licensing. I should also point out that the review scheme that existed before the amendments were made related only to personnel licences, by reason of former regulation 254.</PARA>
<PARA> The controls provided in respect of international air service operations are necessary to enable Australia to meet its obligations under both multilateral and bilateral agreements with other countries and to permit implementation of Government policy. As regards regular airline services, the matter is dealt with in accordance with agreements negotiated between countries. Charter operations are dealt with in accordance with policies decided from time to time that are well publicised. The current policies in relation to charter operations were tabled in the Senate on 7 October 1987. I therefore do not consider a review mechanism should be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> The powers provided by `new' regulation 315b are precisely the same as in the former regulation so designated, except there is reference in subregulation (2) to an aircraft left standing at a departmentally controlled aerodrome in contravention of the Civil Aviation Regulations. Previously, there was reference to an aircraft that was, without the permission of an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, left standing in an area of a departmentally controlled aerodrome other than a designated parking area.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it is necessary to incorporate review rights in respect to decisions under regulation 315b. Such a review would be impracticable in regard to decisions relating to removal of an aircraft that was creating a safety hazard or inconveniencing users of the aerodrome, because speedy removal would be necessary. Decisions relating to designation of an aircraft parking area take account of safety and other operational considerations, as well as the possibility of damage to or excessive wear of assets, and need can arise for quick changes or for immediate consideration of a special case, such as in regard to a particular aircraft that has just arrived.</PARA>
<PARA> No authorisations have been or are proposed to be made in regard to subregulation 315aa (2). I intend to bring forward amendments to regulation 315aa as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) impose conditions and requirements that have to be complied with; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) specify a time limit on those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Statement in relation to these discretions states:</PARA>
<PARA>``The discretion introduced by this technical amendment brings the provision into line with other similar provisions recently introduced into the Regulations.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns are twofold. Firstly, the Committee in its scrutiny of the Regulations has failed to find any reference to the ``similar provisions recently introduced into the Regulations''. The Committee seeks further assistance and information in relation to this explanation.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee seeks your advice in relation to possible avenues of appeal rights in relation to the exercise of Ministerial discretion. The Committee is concerned that the discretions are not subject to review or appeal on the merits of the Ministerial decision and as a result the rights of the holder of a consent may be placed in jeopardy.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter dated 1 September 1988 requesting advice on certain aspects of Statutory Rules 1988 No. 195. In particular, your Committee has sought clarification on two matters, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) Explanatory Statement-explanation relating to new sub-regulations 4 (2) and 7 (2)</PARA>
<PARA> Subregulations 4 (2) and 7 (2) provide the statutory basis for imposing conditions or requirements in a permission (ie. a consent or an approval) to export the goods the subject of export control under subregulations 4 (1) and 7 (1) respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to these provisions, the explanatory statement stated that they were technical amendments bringing the provisions into line with other similar permission controls recently introduced into the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> For the information of the Committee, Subregulation 13d (3), concerning the exportation of certain chemical compounds (introduced into the Regulations by Statutory Rules 1987 No. 97) and subregulation 6 (5), concerning the exportation of coffee (introduced into the Regulations by Statutory Rules 1988 No. 65) are recent examples of similar express provisions conferring a power to impose conditions in an export `permission'. Such a power is common in both the Customs (Prohibited Exports) and (Prohibited Imports) regimes, and it dates back to Statutory Rules 1984 No. 317, which inserted subregulation 4 (1a) into the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. This followed advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that where the regulations were silent as to the power to impose conditions in a permission, there was no such power. The facility to impose conditions in an export or import permission is seen as both an effective mechanism for controlling import and export prohibitions, and a more palatable option than a blanket prohibition on trade in a particular type of goods. Thus, since that date, this express condition making power has appeared in most prohibited import and export controls.</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Right of Review</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that not provision is made for independent review of the discretion to refuse to grant an export permission under both the abovementioned provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern is well-taken. Indeed, the review question arises because of the fact that two items still remain subject to the control regime of the Schedules-ie, ships and aircraft respectively. With regard to ships, it is the Government's intention to restrict the export control over these goods to ships designed or adapted for military purposes, or of major military significance. This will be accommodated by the revision of the defence export control Schedule (Schedule 13), which was announced by the Minister for Defence on 14 June 1988, and is currently being drafted (a copy of the Minister's statement is attached for information). The announced revised Schedule 13 (Regulation 13b) control regime will prohibit the exportation of goods designed or adapted for military purposes (including ships) unless the permission of the Minister for Defence is first obtained. As denials of permission will be on defence and foreign policy grounds, it is not intended to make the Minister's discretion reviewable by the AAT. (This is similar to the position taken on dual-use technology goods in regulation 13e, and chemical precursors in regulation 13d.) However, as with those Regulations and other recent non-reviewable discretions, the decision-maker who might refuse an export-permission will be restricted to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as aircraft are concerned, the same control regime outlined above for `military' ships is proposed for `military' aircraft. The Government's policy on whether the exportation of civilian aircraft should remain subject to export control is currently being reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> Pending the introduction of the revised Schedule 13, and so that the exportation of military ships and aircraft might still be controlled however, the existing control regime for ships and aircraft has been retained. While it is acknowledged the control regime at present can go beyond the desired class of military goods, in fact it will be administered (in so far as ships are concerned) only on the basis of controlling such ships, with denials of permissions being made only at Ministerial level.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as aircraft are concerned, the status-quo of requiring an export permission from the Department of Transport and Communications for the exportation of any aircraft is to be continued. If review of the aircraft prohibition results in a continuing need to control non-military aircraft, the question of reviewability of that decision will then be dealt with, consistent with the practice adopted in all recent (Prohibited Export) and (Prohibited Import) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> I trust the above is of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 29 September 1988, the Committee considered Approval of Application Form APP3-A under sub-section 23dc (2) of the Health Insurance Act 1953; Approval of Application Form APA3-A under sub-section 23df (2) of the Health Insurance Act 1953 and tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee brings to your attention the following matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that on page 1 and subsequent pages of forms APP3-A and APA3-A the following comment appears:</PARA>
<PARA> `Please read Important Notes before completing this application.'</PARA>
<PARA> These `Important Notes' were not supplied to the Committee to assist it in its scrutiny of the relevant documents and the Committee seeks a copy of these notes for its information and scrutiny. The Committee further requests that, in the future, could any such additional information be supplied with the appropriate form.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also notes that there are a number of misprints in relation to form APA3-A. The front approving page refers to the `application form required by paragraph 23df (b) (sic) of the Act'. Section 23df contains a number of paragraph (b)s and the Committee seeks clarification as to whether the correct citation is paragraph 23df (1) (b). On pages 1, 2, 3 and 4 the word `proprierorship' (sic) appears in an incorrect form.</PARA>
<PARA> Question 9 on page 5 of form APP3-A is an example of a number of questions which appear in both the forms. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>`9. After due enquiry, has any proprietor named in question 8 above, ever been:-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) convicted of a relevant offence pursuant to Section 23da (1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, or the Crimes Act 1914, or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the subject of an effective determination by a Medicare Participation Review Committee?'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern relates to the use of the phrase `after due enquiry' which seems to indicate that the person and/or company that is required to fill in the relevant form may be forced to undertake an exhaustive investigation as to the bona fides of the person or persons involved. As there are serious consequences which flow from answering these questions inaccurately the Committee seeks your advice as to the degree of `due enquiry' that is actually required in answering these questions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would welcome your views in relation to these matters.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>3 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 30 September 1988 conveying concerns the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has with regard to the content of application forms required to be lodged by persons seeking status as either an approved pathology practitioner (APP) or an approved pathology authority (APA) under the Health Insurance Act 1973 (`the Act'). I note that you have moved in the Senate on 18 October 1988 for the disallowance of both these forms.</PARA>
<PARA> You have firstly drawn attention to the fact that the Committee was not provided with a copy of the `Important Notes', a copy of which is provided to persons wishing to complete either of these forms. A copy of these `Important Notes' is attached for the Committee's consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> You have then drawn attention to two typographical errors-one in the application form itself (APA3-A) and one in the approval of that form by the Minister's delegate. I confirm that the term `proprierorship' should in fact read `proprietorship' and the reference in the approval of form APA3-A to `paragraph 23df (b)' should in fact read `paragraph 23df (1) (b)'.</PARA>
<PARA> You have finally expressed concern over the use, in both of the above forms, of the expression `after due enquiry' in questions asked of applicants. You cite question 9 in form APA3-A as an example of the type of question about which you are concerned. I offer the following comments in answer to your concern as to what exactly the expression is intended to mean.</PARA>
<PARA> When an application, appropriate fee, and an APP or APA undertaking are given to the Minister for acceptance of the undertaking, the Minister cannot accept the undertaking unless he is satisfied that the person giving it is a fit and proper person to be an APP or APA. In determining whether a person is a fit and proper person, the Minister must have regard to whether the person is associated with a `relevant person'.</PARA>
<PARA> The term `relevant person' is defined in sub-section 23da (1) of the Act. The definition includes persons who have been convicted of certain offences and persons who have been the subject of a determination made by a Medicare Participation Review Committee or a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. It is for the purpose of establishing whether or not an applicant is, or has been, associated with a `relevant person', that the questions in the application forms, about which you are concerned, are asked.</PARA>
<PARA> It was appreciated, however, at the time these questions were framed that a person may not be aware that an associate is a `relevant person'. For this reason the Health Insurance Commission, in consultation with my Department, the Royal Australasian College of Pathologists and the Australian Medical Association, did not consider it appropriate for a person to be required to commit themselves to an unequivocal response. Hence the use of the expression `after due enquiry'.</PARA>
<PARA> It was intended and assumed if an applicant was aware that an associate was a person of the kind specified in the particular question (in other words, a `relevant person'), he or she would answer the question accordingly. If the applicant did not know that an associate was such a person, it was nevertheless considered that he or she should be required to make some enquiries in order to ascertain if this was the case. If an applicant had concerns or worries about any of these matters, he or she would always be able to seek clarification from, for instance, the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> It was never intended that applicants should have to undertake an exhaustive investigation as to the bone fides of past or present associates. It was only ever intended that reasonable enquiries be made appropriate to the circumstances-and this is all that is, and will be, required of applicants. It was considered that the expression `after due enquiry' covered this situation and also addressed the earlier mentioned concern that applicants should not be required to give a unequivocal response.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Committee think it desirable, I am prepared to arrange for an explanation of the expression `due enquiry' to be included in the abovementioned `Important Notes'.</PARA>
<PARA> I trust this information proves useful to the Committee in its deliberations.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment to regulation 25 (b) of the Australian Federal Police regulations has the effect of removing the rank of inspector and the rank of chief inspector of which there are approximately 140 from the prescribed ranks that are entitled to appeal against selection for promotion under regulation 26. Regulation 26 (1) (b) provides a general right of appeal to any person who considers that he or she has a `better claim' to promotion to a certain position than another member selected by the Commissioner for promotion. In such circumstances an aggrieved party may appeal to the Promotions Appeals Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has put forward an alternative mechanism of appeal to the Merit Protection Review Agency. That appeal however is on much more narrow grounds. Contrary to its title, it is not an appeal on merit but rather whether in the selection process there was a breach of the Act or a serious defect in the selection process. Therefore, on its face, certain Federal Police officers were losing rights presently available. In the meantime what has been agreed to-I think at least in part as a result of the notice that was given in this chamber-is that a new internal grievance review panel be established which will enable an examination of matters relating to the methodology of the selection process or in other words to test the promotions assessment procedure. This is regarded as a reasonable compromise by all concerned. I have therefore withdrawn the notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last day of sitting, Thursday, 10 November 1988, Senator Chaney asked me to consider, in the context of relevant resolutions of the Senate, certain remarks made in debate by the Minister for Finance concerning certain private citizens in Western Australia. The Standing Orders of the Senate confer no protection on private individuals in respect of remarks made about them by senators in debate. On that basis I ruled against a point of order which was taken when Senator Walsh was answering a question in relation to the proposed gold companies tax. In his answer, subsequent to that ruling, Senator Walsh named certain individuals and attributed disreputable characteristics to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 22 February this year, the Senate passed certain resolutions relating to matters of parliamentary privilege, including two resolutions concerning statements made in debate about private citizens. One resolution, resolution No. 5, provides a procedure whereby persons aggrieved by remarks made about them in debate may seek to have a response incorporated in the parliamentary record. The first step in this procedure is a submission to the President. The other relevant resolution, resolution No. 9, enjoins senators to exercise their freedom of speech in a responsible manner and to take into account the rights of others and the damage which may be done by allegations concerning individuals. That resolution also allows me to draw its provisions to the attention of the Senate when I consider that it is desirable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Having considered Senator Chaney's comments, and the remarks in question by Senator Walsh, I think that I ought to draw the attention of all senators to resolution No. 9 and to the responsibility which senators have to exercise their freedom of speech in a responsible manner, and to indicate that I will consider carefully any submission made to me under resolution No. 5. I have received a complaint from one of the people named and I am considering the correspondence at the present time.</PARA>

I might have enjoyed the statement more had you drawn the attention specifically of Senator Walsh to resolution No. 9, but I watched him carefully during the statement and he did not seem to flinch or colour or be overcome or mortified by the admonition. Indeed, I heard him repeat the allegation as he came to his place as you were starting to speak. I suspect the problem is not one that has been solved by your statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I also welcome the fact that you have given a public indication that you will consider carefully any submission made to you under resolution No. 5, which does give aggrieved individuals a chance to have a statement made in this place if they believe their position has been misrepresented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the Minister to the Treasurer's address to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) on Friday about the Government's intention to seek a further cut in the fiscal position of the States next year. In the light of our continuing balance of payments and inflation problems, and given that Commonwealth general revenue assistance to the States is estimated to fall by 5 1/2 per cent in real terms this year, is the Government proposing a similar reduction next year? Why does the Government continue to have two standards, one for the States and one for itself, given that its own outlays are expected to decline by only 1.8 per cent this year, compared with the 5 per cent cut in financial assistance to the States? In the light of the Treasurer's address to EPAC, in which he said, `For its part the Commonwealth will further restrain its own outlays in 1989-90', has the Government finally accepted the need for proper fiscal restraint? Will it cut its own outlays next year, to the same extent as any cuts to the States, to help solve some of Australia's continuing and more pressing economic problems?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2478" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It takes an enormous amount of chutzpah for someone who was a member of the Fraser-Howard Government to talk about proper fiscal restraint and in particular to throw it at this Government which, even in this year, has outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) down to a lower level that they were in any of the seven years of the Fraser-Howard regime, and when, as the Treasurer and I have just announced today, on a no policy change assumption outlays will fall again in real terms next year to 24.7 per cent of GDP which, once adjusted for the Medicare changes, will be the lowest level of outlays since 1972-73.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not read the Treasurer's speech. However, I understood from press reports that the real point that he was making is that States as well have a responsibility to exercise tight control over their spendings and borrowings. The fact is that in 1986, in what are now called financial assistance grants, the States received a 2 per cent increase in real terms over the amount received the previous year. In retrospect, I believe that grants to the States in that year were excessively generous, particularly in view of the fact that the great majority of State government expenditure is wages expenditure, and real wages, particularly in the public sector, were at that time falling and had fallen in the previous couple of years. If Senator Messner wants to be critical, one can certainly make the case that the Commonwealth should have been harder on the States in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> We are now in our third year of declining real outlays and looking at a fourth year, as the Forward Estimates published today have shown. There is absolutely no precedent in Australian post-World War II history, or I believe in the post-World War II history of any comparable nation, of any other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country showing expenditure restraint of that magnitude. In the seven years that the Fraser-Howard regime ruled the roost, it did bring down real outlays in one year, but in all of the other six they went up. Senator Messner may also remember that there are two sides to a responsible fiscal policy: one is the outlays side and the other is the revenue side. Of course, we know that when his Party was last in government, in particular in its final year, it was irresponsible on both counts, to the point that it left us with a prospective deficit of almost $10 billion, as Senator Stone was kind enough to point out at the time.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Le Monde newspaper, published in Paris, which claims that Australian diplomacy has had setbacks in island countries of the South Pacific?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Claims of the kind to which Senator Maguire refers, that Australian diplomacy has had setbacks among the island countries of the South Pacific, are not new, including in this place I hasten to add. As I said in a recent speech, there may have been occasions on which criticism of Government policy in the region has been deserved. But claims of declined and declining Australian influence suggest a view of the fragility of Australian influence and interest in the region which is clearly nonsensical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia does not aspire to the role of regional policeman which was identified for us in the Le Monde article. It would be entirely contrary to the policy of constructive commitment which I outlined in the speech referred to. The policy is based on respect for the full sovereignty of all Pacific island states, promotion of close confident bilateral relations on a foundation of effective regional cooperation, shared perceptions of the security interests of the region and recognising that the Pacific island countries' security hinges on economic and social development. They are all the elements of that particular policy which has been spelt out and they are at the opposite end of the spectrum, and are expressly stated to be such, from the notion of a policeman's role which seems to have been identified for us.</PARA>
<PARA> On the specific questions of New Caledonia, which I suppose, underlays the article, it has to be said that as a consequence of the change of policy by France in relation to New Caledonia, a change which the Australian Government believes will contribute very much to the stability of the region, it is the case that relations between France and Pacific island countries have begun to improve. Our reaction to that is very much to welcome it because, as we have consistently acknowledged, France has a valuable role to play itself in the economic, cultural and social development of the region.</PARA>

Despite Mrs Kelly's claims in a recent Press statement concerning statements I made about non-payment and non-determination of allowances for Army personnel serving with the United Nations on the Iran-Iraq border, I ask: Is it not a fact that no allowances have yet been determined despite the fact that these soldiers have been serving in this area since 8 August; that the subsistence allowances provided for daily living are only approximate and must be adjusted when they finally are determined; that the disability component made up of a field element, hazard element and a post allowance has not been paid; that the initial outlay allowance and the special additional outlay allowance which have been paid must be repaid; and that all these allowances are designed to be paid while the duty is being undertaken?

There is absolutely no substance to the allegation that I am adopting the same immigration policy as John Howard.

The Government has said repeatedly that there will be cuts in personal tax rates next calendar year, and there is no reason for any scepticism about that. With regard to cuts in company tax rates, yes, certainly that has happened. The burden of the honourable senator's question is not about company tax rates, it is about whether people are paying them, which is a different thing altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not able to give any detailed answers about the taxation arrangements made by Mr Bond. I can inform the senator that, as I understand it, some of these arrangements were as a result of companies registered in the Cook Islands, which has been a tax haven. That tax haven was closed off in May of this year. Perhaps there will be a different pattern of payment of taxation in coming years as a result of that happening. In so far as the question seeks further detail, I will seek to obtain an answer and provide it to the honourable senator.</PARA>

I am sure that if I do Senator Puplick will rightly be the first on his feet to draw my attention to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles asked whether I am aware of a report in a newspaper. I am aware of a report headed `Medicare rebate cuts hit' by Jenni Cooper, I think in the Australian of today. That article refers to a reduction in schedule fees and rebates for pathology tests for sexually transmitted diseases. A new pathology table was introduced on 1 November following a recommendation from the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC). The PSAC is an independent body which includes representatives of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia and the Australian Medical Association. It is chaired by a deputy president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The new table is designed to stop overservicing. This is obviously in the area of the matter we will debate. It is also designed to have the schedule fees more accurately reflect the cost of doing various tests.</PARA>
<PARA> The press report incorrectly claims that the fee for a chlamydia test will be reduced from $17.20 to $9. Under the old schedule the appropriate item for a chlamydia test had a schedule fee of $12.20. It is unlikely that chlamydia tests would be done at a financial loss as the reagents for the test cost only about $3.50, out of a schedule fee of $9.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government agrees with Health Minister Collins from New South Wales that chlamydia testing is important and commends the New South Wales Government and various medical groups on the planned chlamydia control program. The Federal Government notes the suggestion that we should consider alternative methods of funding these tests. We would be happy to consider funding through the public hospital system if that is what Mr Collins wants.</PARA>

Can the Minister confirm that this is the case? Is the Minister aware of statements claiming that the recent immigration debate within Australia has created a perception in many Asian countries that Australia discriminates against Asians on the grounds of race? Is this perception justified and is it harming Australia's business migration program and reducing the economic opportunities available to Australia in the region? Will the Minister, as one way of overcoming this perception, consider amending the Migration Act in a way which prohibits discrimination against prospective migrants on the grounds of race?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had reason, in response to an earlier question, to criticise those headlines saying, `Ray is trying to cut back on family immigration'. Now we have in the Sydney Morning Herald the headline `Ray is cutting back on business migration and skilled migration'. It reminds me of a candidate we once had in the Latrobe Valley. The headline in the Morwell Mercury was `Murphy supports abortion'. In the Traralgon Tattler the headline was `Murphy opposes abortion'. When the television crew finally tracked him down he simply said, `I was misquoted', and walked away, so we never did find out what his attitude was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have read the article that Senator Dunn referred to. I will not respond in any detail. She will have to wait two or three weeks, until we can formally respond to the FitzGerald report, to see what ratio this Government believes is appropriate between the skills stream-the economic focus stream-and the family stream.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn went on to ask whether I was aware of statements claiming that the recent immigration debate in Australia had created a perception in certain Asian countries that we discriminate against Asians in terms of race. That is a perception that exists in Asia. It is one that for better or worse is believed in a variety of Asian countries. It does not take much to promote that belief, given our history prior to 1973, when quite clearly this country, almost in a proud way, discriminated against people from Asia.</PARA>
<PARA> As to whether that has gone on to harm our business migration program, I instinctively think, `Yes, it has', but at this stage I cannot measure the extent. There are lags in the system of three to 10 months for approval. The evidence from business migration agents, especially in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea, is that their clientele is diminishing rather than growing. Whereas 70 people turned up to listen to the details at a business migration seminar in Seoul a year ago, only seven turned up at the most recent one. There is no overwhelming or compelling evidence yet, but we do not need much of a drop-off-we need only about 700 in a program of 12,000 not to come-for it to cost this country $350m in terms of money brought in.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the final part of the Senator Dunn's question was quite separate from the others. She asked whether the Government would consider amending the Migration Act to prohibit discrimination against prospective migrants. I would have thought that that should be put as a more general question as to whether the Government was minded to legislate against racism. I must say that I can see both merit in that and problems with it. Sometimes when we introduce legislation to prohibit something we create victims in society, because it can be so distorted. I do not think that it is a straightforward matter of merely introducing legislation to enforce goodness in people. Sometimes that can backfire, not on us, but on some of the other people in society who are the natural victims. It is a suggestion that is certainly worthy of consideration, but it needs to be given lengthy and considered consideration-if that is not too much tautology.</PARA>

Mr Ian Irvine, Westpac's national manager of personal lending, said that it was estimated that two-thirds of borrowers were reliant on two incomes to repay their loans and, in some cases, it meant putting off having a family for more than 10 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government takes the view that the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers last week does represent a positive step forward in the search for peace in the Middle East. We do welcome the Council's acceptance of United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution 242 as the basis of an international conference in the Middle East, which is the way in which it expressed it, although it has to be acknowledged that this still falls short of that absolutely unequivocal statement of Israel's right to exist; that is to say, not conditional upon the holding of conferences or for that matter on the acceptance of other resolutions as well which many countries, including Australia, have been urging the Palestine Liberation Organisation to make. We also welcome the Palestine National Council's explicit rejection of, as it puts it, the threat or use of force, violence and terrorism against the territorial integrity of other states, although again as a significant qualification we remain concerned that the accompanying exception which was made for, and as it was put, the natural right to defend the territorial integrity and independence of the newly declared state of Palestine obviously does not comprehensively rule out, as one would hope would be the case, the use of terrorism in the pursuit of the Palestinians' political objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of Australian recognition of the declaration of a Palestinian state, which was probably the centrepiece of last week's meeting, will arise only in the context of an acceptable negotiated resolution of the future of the occupied territories. The Australian Government takes the view that quite apart from the generally accepted legal preconditions for the recognition of statehood- that is to say, an identifiable territorial unit containing a permanent population under the authority of its own government and capable of entering into relations with other states-the question of a Palestinian state we say cannot be resolved by unilateral declaration but only in the context of an overall settlement of the Middle East dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of an overall settlement, it is our position and continues to be our position that we support the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including independence and the possibility of their own independent state. We also, as I have indicated elsewhere, support the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the UN as a means of resolving ultimately, perhaps the only means of resolving, the Arab-Israeli dispute. But the important point to make overall is that, even with the limitations and the weaknesses which I have mentioned, the statements emerging from the Palestine National Council's Algerian meeting are an important significant step forward on the road to peace in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that the Government of Israel should acknowledge and recognise the new and positive elements in the Palestine National Council's declaration and that it should respond in a constructive and forthright manner. A failure to respond positively to these developments will only entrench further the despair which has become a hallmark of this conflict and support the position of extremists on both sides who deny that there can ever be a political solution to the problem.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted the comments of his parliamentary colleague, Mr Ronald Edwards, the honourable member for Stirling, who is reported today to have said that the proposed new electoral boundaries in Western Australia made it look `as if we have Queensland politics at work in Western Australia' and that they `make a nonsense of representative democracy'? Will the Minister dissociate the Government from this slur on the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Office and, in particular, those responsible for drawing the proposed new boundaries? Will the Minister also give the Senate the Government's reaction to the suggested changes, given the confusion about the Australian Labor Party's attitude because of the conflicting statements of Mr Edwards and the honourable member for Canning, Mr George Gear, who has described the redistribution as `eminently sensible'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not the first occasion that the integrity of a redistribution has arisen in this chamber. I am being totally consistent when I say that the commissioners operate in an apolitical and fair way in what they regard as being in the best interests of a fair electoral redistribution. If Mr Edwards had not criticised them I would regard him as a twerp. Anyone who gets 6 per cent cut off his or her electorate is allowed one outbreak-one complaint. Is Senator Short suggesting that he should not be allowed to have one spray at the commissioners-I do not think he will have another-especially when the shape of the electorate is, probably for right and proper reasons, a little unusual?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short asked for the Government's reaction to the redistribution. I have said it here before: one cops where the chips fall. In 1984 the chips fell well for the Labor Party in Western Australia but badly for it in Queensland. We accepted it then. Honourable senators opposite can scoff. But unlike their former Government and unlike Senator Withers we do not interfere in the Commission's work by trying to swap names around. The National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia in Queensland are feuding; nothing ever changes. I know the chief electoral officer of Western Australia, Mr Barry Young, personally. He has done an excellent job over the last few years. I know Dr Colin Hughes, who has done an excellent job as Chief Electoral Commissioner. Again, whatever the results are in Victoria, each political party has to cop it. I also point out that for people who are dissatisfied with boundaries an appeals process exists. They have 28 days in which to lodge appeals. There is then a 60-day public hearing route. The coalition would never put in these particular proceedings. We had to do that. We had to--</PARA>

He can use that; it might help him in his preselection. Just to conclude, in my view the redistribution was done with integrity, with honesty and in an apolitical way, as always will be done while we have the protections in the system. Senator Short asked me to dissociate myself from Ron Edwards. I will not do so. Members-Liberal, Labor or National-who have their seats abolished or who have 6 per cent whacked off them are entitled to one public whack at the commissioners to get rid of their frustrations. I am sure that, if in 1977 we had taken all the safe Liberal areas out of Ballarat and left Senator Short stranded, he would have said exactly the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

Second, will the Minister explicitly rule out the establishment of nuclear bases in Australia? Third, if not, under what circumstances does the Minister envisage the establishment of such bases?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a transcript of the remarks of the Minister for Defence on the ABC to which Senator Sanders refers. In answer to a question as to whether he could ever envisage American nuclear defence bases being established in Australia he said, `No, I can't foresee that circumstance arising'. Later in the same answer he said, `I have never been given any indication by the United States that any of the sort of cruise missile bases or F111 bases or those sorts of equivalents are required as far as Australia is concerned, and geographically it would not be sensible for that to arise'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to a further question about whether it could ever happen, the Minister replied, `Well, nobody could ever say never, but it's so unlikely as to be out of the ball park of discussion, I think'. The Minister recognises that the basing of nuclear weapons in Australia would be contrary to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and he can, of course, rule out the establishment of such bases in Australia as being completely contrary to Government and Australian Labor Party policy. The term `nuclear base', as the Minister made clear in the answer I have quoted, refers to bases at which nuclear weapon systems are stored or operated. None of the United States-Australian joint facilities, of course, is a nuclear base within that definition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prospects for a negotiated settlement of Namibia's independence are looking more hopeful than they have for some years. Progress has been made in recent discussions on the question of Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola. Tentative agreement on a timetable for withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola was achieved in Geneva on the 15th of this month. The agreement, however, has to be ratified by the governments involved: Cuba, Angola and South Africa. We certainly welcome the constructive approach which has been taken so far by Angola, Cuba and South Africa and call on them to finalise the negotiations. While the present situation does obviously thus exhibit some hopeful signs, it still is a little too early to conclude that the United Nations plan is about to be implemented, but certainly if the momentum is maintained the plan could be implemented beginning early next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An integral part of the UN plan is deployment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to monitor the implementation of the plan.

To follow up the last part of the question, I inform the honourable senator that Australia would be willing to consider, in the Budget context, a request for Australian assistance made by an internationally recognised government of an independent Namibia, but it is likely to be some time yet before such a government is in prospect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the second part of the question, the Government has already made very substantial concessions in regard to the assets test for people who are living on farms. In regard to the first part of the question, I have seen the Opposition's retirement income policy. Among other things, the policy says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the assets test will not apply to retirees who: wish to retire on or from the family farm when they intend passing it on to their close relations who are already working on the farm and drawing their primary income from it;</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that raises a number of complications. Firstly, what is the definition of a family farm? Is it an unincorporated enterprise, and, if it is not an unincorporated enterprise, what is it? Far more importantly, the Opposition's policy betrays a feudal view of life; that is, that the right and proper-indeed, almost essential-thing is that people whose parents are farmers will become farmers and take over the family farm.

Not all members of the AAT are members of the judiciary, but I think some of the most senior members may be regarded as having judicial office. The Minister has called them fools. The fact is that the AAT has made some decisions which are unfavourable to the administration of government policy, and the Minister, for that reason, classifies them as fools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a judicial body, Mr President, but I will withdraw. Contrary to the views and pontifications of some members of the AAT, the plain fact is that most of the land presently farmed in Australia was not farmed by the parents, let alone the grandparents, of the present owner-managers. It is just as well that it is not because if it were we would have a small-farm problem of European dimensions, a fact of which I am certain Senator Stone is well aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the other, economic, effects of this policy, on the one hand, somebody has a very substantial asset with a market value of, say, half a million dollars, and, if that asset is not overvalued and is being effectively managed, it will return an income which would easily disqualify a person from receiving any age pension at all. If, on the other hand, the asset is either overvalued or being inefficiently managed, there is absolutely no case for a government to intervene to prop up the overvaluation of assets or to provide rewards for managerial inefficiency. Indeed, it is of course a very big negative if a government should go down that track.</PARA>
<PARA> The next section of the Opposition's policy says that people will be exempt from the assets test if they `remain or settle on relatively small or non-viable land holdings'. Do these mugs never learn? If they put something like that in, they will create a shelter. What do they think is going to happen to the price of land? What is the definition of a `non-viable holding'? To the extent that somebody provides an incentive to buy up a bit of land and says, `This is a non-viable farm; therefore I will be exempt from the assets test', the Opposition will be encouraging both a sharp upward movement in the price of land and, moreover, the almost certain inefficient use of that land.</PARA>
<PARA> The most alarming or ominous sign of all is, of course, that it shows that the National Party of Australia is still calling the shots in the coalition in opposition, just as it always did in government and as it will if it ever gets into government again. That is the most ominous warning to come out of this: the National Party still rules the roost in the coalition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I mentioned earlier that the Forward Estimates published today show, on a no policy change basis, negative real growth of 0.7 per cent in 1989-90, which will make this the fourth consecutive year in which expenditure in real terms has fallen. There is, of course, no precedent since the Second World War for that either in Australia or in any comparable country. Real expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) already stands at 25.5 per cent of gross domestic product and will fall on the Forward Estimates to 24.7 per cent next year. On a percentage of GDP basis, real expenditure is already lower than it was in any year since 1974-75. The other point which I believe is worth noting is that, in spite of that unprecedented tight expenditure control policy, the most disadvantaged 10 or 15 per cent of the population have been more than completely protected from any decline in their real incomes. Indeed, there has been a modest enhancement of basic pension rates during that period; there have been very significant increases in rental allowances to people who must pay rent; not to mention, of course, the more than 1.1 million additional people who have jobs now but who did not have jobs five or six year ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last, but probably most important of all in terms of equity and protecting people on low incomes who have dependent children, there was the introduction last year of the family allowance supplement which, for a low income family with three dependent children, provides the same after-tax income as would be provided by a wage increase in excess of $100 a week. I regard that as the proudest achievement of the Government and one which, along with the other things I have mentioned, of course is an achievement which has been attained in spite of the fact that the Government has presided over unprecedented stringency in the control of total Commonwealth Government outlays.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key part of the question from Senator Puplick was the last one, when he referred to the Australian Labor Party's public funding laws. That particular aspect the honourable senator did not oppose. This particular donation will have to be declared after the next election because the time clock usually ends, I think, at midnight on election day. The disclosure time for the next election starts straightaway thereafter. If there were a $70,000 donation-the press reports on that probably are accurate-it will in fact have to be disclosed next time. If the Australian Electoral Commission was minded to believe that that donation was not a direct donation but one in which money was being channelled through via intermediaries, it has the necessary powers to investigate that. If it does not have the necessary powers to investigate these matters, when the next Commonwealth electoral Bill is introduced in the autumn session it will certainly be amended to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked about Mr Richard Farmer. I do know in fact that he has worked for the Labor Party as a consultant. The honourable senator asked whether the money was sent to Jonathon West. I have no idea whether it was but I have no information to the effect that that assertion is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whether it was a pay-off. I do not know. He asked whether the money was channelled. I do not know. Similarly, I would not know if he started asking me questions about Community Polling, an organisation in New South Wales which apparently dished out tens of thousands of dollars to specific candidates. The honourable senator would know all about that, being an ex-Askin car driver taking the brown paper bags around to candidates-without telling Sir John Carrick that these things used to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is any impropriety in this matter it is up to the Electoral Commission to pursue it. Certainly, Minister West would put no impediments in the way of pursuing these inquiries as he has put none in the way of the Commission pursuing inquiries into Carpentaria Pty Ltd in regard to some $300,000 from the Country-Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. The Electoral Commission is looking for the source of that money. That company is a $2 company which has no record of trading performance whatsoever. All these issues indicate just how difficult it is to write laws to properly govern this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer Senator Puplick to the report by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. It acknowledged that not every loophole could be closed but that these laws were meant to have a moral sanction as much as possible and that exposure was the key element in keeping political parties honest. That would be the case if there was something shonky about this donation, something shonky about the Greiner donations or something shonky about Carpentaria Pty Ltd in the Northern Territory. It is probably public exposure most of all. Senator Puplick points to one matter that has always troubled me in regard to this; that is, public exposure three years later could be useless. If there developed in political parties a trend of people saying, `Give us the money afterwards so it will not show up for a few years' that would be bad, although any political professional knows that it is a real risk asking for money after the election when the results are known.</PARA>

A number of demands were made and delegations were formed to make approaches to various Ministers, senators and so on. The sit-in broke up at approximately 5.45 p.m.</PARA>

<TITLE>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS: REFUSAL TO ISSUE DRUG</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="2491" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 November I was asked by Senator Panizza a question concerning prescription of the drug heparin calcium. At that time I took the question on notice and I now give the answer. The article in the Western Australian Sunday Times of 6 November is a continuation of a story first reported in that paper on 16 October. The original article quoted as its informant the President of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), Dr Michael Jones. Dr Jones was alleged in that article to have claimed that a gynaecologist requested authority to prescribe the drug heparin calcium `because of a new authorities system which restricts the type and amount of drugs prescribed. The Federal Government brought in the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to encourage doctors to prescribe cheaper medication'. Dr Jones was further quoted as saying that a bungling public servant refused the vital drug for a pregnant woman and exposed her to a potentially deadly risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts of the case in chronological order are: the doctor applied in writing on 4 October 1988 to the Department of Community Services and Health for approval to prescribe an increased maximum quantity of the drug heparin calcium. The application was received in the Perth office on 7 October 1988 and was returned the same day for clarification-heparin calcium-heparin sodium. The doctor rang the Department on 12 October 1988 and approval was granted immediately. The prescription was presented to a pharmacy for dispensing at 4.25 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> For Dr Jones to have made the statements attributed to him in the original article he must have been ignorant of the authority system. The case had nothing to do with a recent Government decision requiring some high cost pharmaceutical benefit drugs to be prescribed `authority only'. Heparin calcium is available as a pharmaceutical benefit without restriction. The gynaecologist in this case sought approval to prescribe more than the standard maximum quantity under regulations that have existed for as long as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If the prescriber had a genuine belief that his patient was at risk for her life, a prescription for the standard quantity with repeats would have immediately given 15 days treatment pending issue of approval to prescribe the larger quantity. On the urgency question, it is interesting that the prescription was not presented to a pharmacy for dispensing until seven days after issue.</PARA>
<PARA> A more recent story on the same subject, which appeared in the Australian Dr Weekly of 4 November 1988, quoted Dr Jones as now claiming that the gynaecologist applied on an authority form `to save the woman the expense of paying for repeated prescriptions'. Therefore, the issue was money saving and not life saving, as claimed originally by Dr Jones. The incident was blown out of proportion due to misleading and exaggerated public statements by Dr Jones as part of a wider AMA campaign directed against the recent Government decision to extend authority restrictions to some high cost drugs even though the circumstances were irrelevant to that issue. It is not proposed to take action against the public servant who sought clarification of the original application or to amend an authorities system that has operated successfully for many years.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper is the second report but the first for a full year's operation of the Affirmative Action Agency, which was established following the passage of the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. The legislation was passed in 1986 with the support of both sides-I suppose all major parties-in this Parliament. It was passed with the support of the Opposition in the Senate and its passage was preceded by the work and report of a working party on which both sides of the Parliament were represented. In fact, I had the privilege of being the Opposition representative on that working party. The debate was fairly memorable. I seem to recall that the Opposition sought some 30 amendments to the legislation, and most would have been very worth while. They included an amendment which sought to extend the cover of equal employment opportunity to women working in Commonwealth statutory authorities. I seem to recall that that amendment was supported by everyone on this side and it has come to pass that that is now the law. </PARA>
<PARA> This annual report is a record of achievement by the Affirmative Action Agency, a record of its discharge of its duties under the statute, and a report which brings credit to Ms Pratt and the officers working with her. It is a statement of reassurance for those who feared that the passage of this legislation would be the end of the world as they knew it. There were people who felt that this legislation would require them to employ people who otherwise would have been unsuitable. This report makes it clear to me that that has not been the case, and it was never going to be the case, and should give reassurance to those people. The report is a useful signpost for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that this report covers the period when only companies with 1,000 or more employees were required to report. In the year now in progress that will come down to all companies with 500 or more employees. Companies which are waiting to put in their first report, those with 500 or more employees, and those who next year will have to report-those with 100 or more employees-will be able to get from this first report not only some reassurance but also some useful signposting of the way in which the material they provide will be used. One thing that is clear is that the information is being used only in an aggregated sense. The report presents to us in an aggregated way the pattern of behaviour and that, of course, is something that we want to know. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the report. I am pleased that it has emerged in the form it has. I had a careful look at the three companies which failed to comply. I imagine that it is probably due to inadvertence rather than ill will. I certainly place no great significance on it in that the three companies do not in any sense immediately present themselves as being ideologically combative, and I will be interested to see how they respond next year. I have noted the names of the companies, although I am not going to name them today. I welcome the report as an addition to a cause which is essentially liberal and which is essentially power enhancing for women. On that basis it is something we should welcome. I wish the Affirmative Action Agency well in the work it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am pleased to speak to the Affirmative Action Agency annual report 1987-88. I make the comment that we have received that report in a very short time. We have not waited for two or three years for it to come through; it has been brought to the attention of the Parliament very rapidly. I place on record my congratulations to Valerie Pratt and my appreciation of the work she, along with her staff, has done in the Agency. That organisation is not very heavily staffed; in fact, as I note from the report, the recruitment of staff is still under way. The Agency needs to be congratulated on what it has produced in this report on a very tight budget and with a very trim team, and I commend particularly the recommendation of Valerie Pratt as the Director of the Agency. I remember with appreciation the work of the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Susan Ryan, which led to the introduction and the passage of the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Bill in this place. I think that should be commended and the Senate should be reminded of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note Senator Peter Baume's contribution-I think he actually put it as his participation-on the working group. The bipartisan approach as well as the cooperation of employers, government and unions in that working party stage meant a very successful outcome for the legislation and its fairly bipartisan support in this place. From time to time, if one wants some very amusing bedtime reading, the affirmative action debates in this place do give cause for some merriment, although I refer not to the contributions of honourable senators on this side of the chamber or, indeed, of some of those on the other side. I particularly remind the Senate of the definition in the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act of `affirmative action'. Affirmative action for women as applied in the Act is described in the Green Paper as:</PARA>
<PARA> A systematic means, determined by the employer in consultation with senior management, employees and unions of ensuring the achieving of equal employment opportunity for women. Affirmative action is compatible with appointment and promotion on the basis of merit, skills and qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA>People need to be reminded of this point. Despite the time in which affirmative action has been able to settle into the community and the success that this report clearly indicates in employers and workers now understanding the terms of affirmative action, from time to time there is still some doubt in the community as to what exactly affirmative action is about. There is a concern that it moves away from the merit principle. I am pleased to have the opportunity to reiterate that definition of affirmative action. It is based on merit and on reasonableness-what employers and employees can properly work out together. I note too that the Agency has a role in assisting employers not only in producing their report but also in understanding how affirmative action policies may be put into practice and designed with particular needs taken into account. The Agency plays very much a facilitatory role; it is not combative or confrontationist. To a large extent, it stands as an excellent model of the good outcome that can be expected when those kinds of preferred processes are put into place and developed. We can take considerable heart from this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I second Senator Peter Baume's comments about it standing in very good stead for other smaller employers or smaller numbers of workers in the next year or so. As the 500 to 999 employees come on stream the smaller groups can again look at this document. They also have the agency to call on for assistance in formulating their own affirmative action programs. I believe that the fear and anxiety that might have been around prior to the legislation being implemented ought to be completely put to rest on reading this report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to some of the words quoted in the annual report of the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General where reference is made to the doubling of the workload of the Office during the bicentennial year. It simply states:</PARA>
<PARA> In all, the commitments involved in travelling, speechmaking, affording hospitality, and simply meeting people will, in the bicentennial year, be at least twice those of an ordinary year. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to make the point that in 1985 when the Department of Finance, at the request of the Official Secretary, conducted a survey of the Office, the Department concluded in a report to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that significant productivity gains had been achieved partly through the use of word processing technology, partly through the use of casual or contract employees to meet peak workloads and partly through improved performance on the part of the staff, and that the scope for further efficiency gains appeared to be quite limited. The report recommended that, in the circumstances, the Office be exempted from the administrative efficiency dividend. The report tells us that despite this the efficiency dividends have been extracted from the Governor-General's Office at a time when the Office has had required of it a higher rather than a lower level of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I compare those very reasonable statements by the Office in its annual report with the Government's extravagance in providing funds for the Governor-General-designate to travel extensively overseas, the trip having been forestalled by Mr and Mrs Hayden's need to return for the funeral of Mrs Blewett. In Estimates Committee A hearings we were informed that to date bills had been received for some $26,484. Indeed, we heard that the trip was initially meant to cost some $80,000. In addressing the annual report of the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General, I simply want to make the point that that Office has carried out its duties and tasks in an exemplary fashion in a time when its workload has doubled and when it has been expected to cut back to meet the administrative efficiency dividend. At the same time, the Government has seen fit to expend taxpayers' money on this overseas junket. In our reservation to Estimates Committee A report to the Senate we made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's authorisation of this expenditure was completely irresponsible. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1987-88 annual report of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC) is very welcome in that it contains a considerable amount of detail about the activities of the Department. It omits to say many things that I think need to be said about the Department at this time, particularly in terms of the difficulties that the Department is experiencing in many areas as a result of the major restructuring that has occurred within it over the past year or so. In that context there was a very important article in the Australian Financial Review yesterday, 21 November, by Peter Roberts concerning the matters affecting the Department. Some of those point to a very major slump in moral and a loss of important personnel over the last year or so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had the continued misfortune of having to remain under the grip of the same Minister, who, like the Department, is obviously getting older and more tired otherwise the problems of morale within the Department could not be as acute as they are. For example, over the last year or so DITAC lost 12 of its 61 senior executive staff and 170 third division officers out of 1,100. This is a very considerable loss of senior staff at a very important time in the Department's history. There has also been the loss to Treasury of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). This was a significant loss for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, despite the changed role perhaps to some extent of the IAC in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review makes particular mention of the degree of mishandling and constant undermining of key programs from outside that has produced uncertainties in business and reduced the effectiveness of the portfolio arrangements. Without going into further detail on those matters, I just make the point that they are important criticisms of the Department, not necessarily in a direct sense but certainly in so far as the Department has the capacity to carry out the mandate that it has been given. I am pleased to see the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) at the table. I hope that he takes on board the comments that are around about the Department and its role, particularly its role in the scheme of things, vis-a-vis the Treasury and the Department of Finance. All the signs are that the Minister's Department is losing out heavily to those departments. If that is the case and it is causing a major morale problem, the Minister not only would be aware of it but would want to let the Senate know in due course what actions the Government has in mind to redress the problems within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report also lacks any criticism-perhaps understandably-of the Government's industry policy resulting from the absence of an appropriate economic environment. I would say to the Government that there is no point in having a micro policy in relation to manufacturing industry or any other sector of industry in the economy if the Government is not going to manage the macro-economy in a way that will be conducive to growth and development in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the assurances and rhetoric of the Government, Australia's economic progress in recent years has been very largely illusory. If one looks at the basic underpinning of this economy-that is, productivity-it has not only stalled in the last three years but has actually fallen steadily in that period. If that fall is not corrected rapidly, we will continue to go backwards in an increasingly competitive international market. There are other comments that I and other speakers on this side would like to make on this report. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I rise to speak to the annual report 1987-88 of the Australian Tourist Commission. This report was tabled less than an hour and a half ago and there has not been enough time to examine it in any great detail. There has been time only to look for special areas of interest. Australia's national tourism marketing body, the Australian Tourist Commission, was established some 20 years ago, in 1967. During the period of review of this particular report the new Australian Tourist Commission Act was passed, in 1987, and came into operation, on 25 May this year. I remind honourable senators that that piece of legislation passed through this place just over a year ago and, as I successfully moved five amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats to ensure that Australia would be protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism, I looked through the report to see where this would be reflected. On page 9 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the new Act, prime objectives of the ATC are to increase the number of overseas visitors to Australia and to monitor the environmental and social impact of international tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, one of the nine board members appointed is Penny Figgis, who is Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. A section of the report which is entitled `Looking ahead' makes an assessment of some of the issues which the Commission believes it should consider. These are issues which have been debated in this place before and obviously the people engaged in tourism do need to consider these issues very carefully. The first is high prices. The cost of accommodation, especially at the top end of the market, has increased dramatically and in some instances prices have risen with little notice. The next matter is the accommodation range. There is a shortage of moderately priced three- and four-star hotels. Concern has emerged about the extent of foreign ownership of tourism facilities, and facilities in many airports are inadequate, especially in Sydney, where 56 per cent of visitors form their first impressions of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tourism industry needs to place more emphasis on training staff, particularly tour guides with language skills. This matter also has been raised a number of times in this place and a number of honourable senators have been very disappointed to learn that operators such as Qantas Airways Ltd would consider importing Japanese speaking people rather than training up their own staff in that area. Shopping hours and licensing laws also frustrate some tourists. As far as the environment is concerned, the section of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia must retain a balance between protection of its natural heritage and access to it. Developers must be allowed to cater for increasing numbers of tourists, but not to the detriment of the very attractions visitors come to see. </PARA>
<PARA>It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>Action on these issues and others is essential if Australia is to achieve its full long-term potential in international tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>Like Senator Puplick, I look forward to reading the results of that action in a future report. There are some rather fascinating statistics in the report which give the percentage of visitors and the purpose of their visit. For example, 53.9 per cent of visitors come for holiday purposes. The greatest number within that section are the 83 per cent from Japan. Another 20.6 per cent come to visit relatives, and the highest proportion there is 44.8 per cent from the United Kingdom. Another 10.9 per cent come on business, with 12.1 per cent of those coming from New Zealand. Again, 4.8 per cent visit this country in transit, with 5.7 of them coming from New Zealand; and 2 per cent come for convention purposes, with the highest number there being 3.2 per cent from Canada. The report is outstandingly glossy. I leave my comments there. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This document on the Forward Estimates of Budget outlays for the years from 1990 to 1992 has been placed before us at the bottom of the papers list in a way that does not enable members of the Opposition to properly explore all the matters of detailed government administration that are set out herein. The document is full of great detail as to the next three years of government activities, but the way the Government handles it precludes any proper examination of those affairs. It is becoming too much a part of this Government's behaviour in putting down very important papers and very important reports such as this one to include them in the papers list in a way that precludes proper debate on them. I draw attention to that because I believe it is a way in which this Government is hiding from debate on the most important issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time today we became aware of free kicks being given to the Government, its members being in possession of the report while members of the Opposition were not. In the House of Representatives the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and in this place Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, got up and told us how great the Government is because it has been able to get its percentage of expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product down to a level that has not been seen in this country for 50 years. But when the paper was finally tabled in the Senate and we thumbed through it as quickly as we could, we found on page 5 that the claims that there is to be a significant reduction in government outlays over the next three years as a proportion of gross domestic product fall to the ground. Yet we have just been through a period in both Houses when the Government was claiming enormous credit for what it is seeking to achieve by its claim that expenditures have fallen as a proportion of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me examine some of the assumptions that are included in the numbers which have been claimed by the Government. The Government says that in the year ending 1992 government expenditures will have fallen to a low of 23.7 per cent, compared with 25.8 per cent at the present time. However, this is based on an assumption that there will be a 3.25 per cent growth in gross domestic product in each of the three years from now on. That is pretty heroic assumption in the light of overseas developments at the present time and the figures emanating from the Government, which claims that it is its policy to reduce growth over the next three years significantly from what it is at the moment. So obviously that inflates, for the purpose of these figures, the gross domestic product figure and leads us to a misleading conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is that the figures demonstrate quite clearly-and I quote from the report-`that the decline in the ratio of outlays to gross domestic product however is influenced by a possible conservative bias in the forward Estimates due to the natural termination of fixed term commitments'. In other words, what has happened is that outgoings have occurred for some years-an example would be in the building of the new Parliament House-and they will come to an end during the next three years. Quite clearly this leads to an overstatement of Government outlays if there are no adjustments for new policies. Of course, there will be new policies that will inflate the figures to an extent higher than those stated in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government's practice of trying to hide the true position on outlays and of spreading good news around-such as the free kicks that it was given during Question Time here and in the House of Representatives-is totally unfair and consequently does not properly represent what the Government is doing in the financial area and in all other areas of its administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on the Forward Estimates of Budget Outlays 1988-89 to 1990-91 reveals that the Government has not cut its expenditure effectively at all. The report states that the current outlays on the Commonwealth's own behalf are not expected to change in real terms in 1988-89, and this is despite the fact that the 1989 figures reflect the movement off-Budget of outlays and revenues of the Civil Aviation Authority and the full year effect of the movement off-Budget of the Federal Airports Corporation. That is just a brief indication of what the report reveals. It reveals that the Government has not done enough to cut its own spending and it explains why it has to rely so heavily on monetary policy and the pushing up of interest rates. It also explains why the economic future that we face in this country has been so mismanaged, and how it has been so mismanaged by this Government.

<PARA>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a significant step in the Government's objective to provide more diverse television and radio services. It amends the Broadcasting Act to introduce a special category of limited licences aimed at meeting the need for a variety of specialised services which require technical planning but do not warrant the stringent program conditions applied to current broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA> These services will include such things as information services and special event coverage. Most significantly in this Bicentennial year, they will provide also an appropriate means of implementing the Government's policy of placing control of broadcasting to remote Aboriginal and Islander communities where it belongs, in the hands of the communities themselves. I refer, of course, to the BRACS scheme, Broadcasting for Remote Aboriginal Communities Services, announced jointly in September last year by my predecessor and by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of other less significant, but equally necessary, changes. These are desirable reforms to the Broadcasting Act and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act which cannot wait for the thorough reviews of all aspects of broadcasting policy now being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and by the Department of Transport and Communications. The Bill also clarifies the legal status of a number of practices, such as relaying radio services to people ``on hold'' on the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now with the proposals in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA>New Licensing Arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The specialised services to be encompassed by limited licences do not have the same public interest implications as current forms of broadcasting, either because of the minor nature of the service or, as in the case of BRACS services, because they are primarily the concern of the community served. </PARA>
<PARA> Any possible public interest in these services can be safeguarded without invoking the complex rules applying to existing categories of services. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, limited licences will permit the licensing of services for local information, special event, remote Aboriginal community or national broadcaster channel-sharing purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Limited licences will be administered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as they involve program origination. However, they will be subject to simplified administrative procedures and flexibility will be ensured by the capacity to create new types of limited licence by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister currently initiates licensing of all broadcasting services by inviting applications. Prospective limited licensees will be able to apply for licences without invitation. The Minister will retain the power to reject or defer those applications on planning or technical grounds but, otherwise, they will be referred to the Tribunal for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The licence will specify the purpose for which it is granted and licensees will be required to provide a service consistent with that purpose, not one which is ``adequate and comprehensive'' as for existing forms of service. Either the Minister, through specifying the purposes, or the Tribunal, in imposing licence conditions, may refine the purpose of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> A licence for information purposes will authorise one of two kinds of service. The first is an information service relevant to the interests of persons residing in, working in or visiting a particular area. Operators of tourist attractions and leisure resorts and some local councils see potential in broadcasting, for example, up to date information on events or places of interest in the local area. Other services could provide information about local road conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second kind of information service will provide text or graphic material. Some doubt has arisen as to whether these services are covered by the main broadcasting licence of the service provider. Licensing teletext services as limited licences will allow the legal status of those exiting services to be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> Special event licences will relate to sporting events, festivals, exhibitions, expositions or other special events. For example, a licence may be granted to cover the environs of an exhibition for the duration of the particular event. </PARA>
<PARA> The BRACS scheme, which I referred to earlier, will bring broadcasting services to more than 60 remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and provide opportunities for these communities to include their own programs. It will enable communities to control reception and will, therefore, help to protect traditional languages and culture. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the scheme, Aboriginal and Islander communities will be able to receive ABC, Public and Commercial Services and rebroadcast them, either live or delayed, under agreements with the host broadcaster. It will be possible to insert other programs like those now being produced by Aboriginal media organisations such as CAAMA, the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association in Alice Springs, and the first Aboriginal-owned commercial television service, Imparja. The Communities will be able to delete offensive material or switch off the entire system at certain times, such as during ceremonial occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the ABC and the SBS to make broadcasting facilities and staff available to limited licensees for broadcasting purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the national broadcasters have entered into informal channel sharing arrangements with public broadcasters and community based program makers. Examples include the ABC's high frequency inland service where about 45 per cent of week day programming is provided by Aboriginal groups through CAAMA and SBS Television's ``windows'' series. The host broadcaster retains editorial and publishing responsibility for broadcasts and, therefore, potential legal liability for defamation and other breaches. ``special interest'' limited licences will enable the programmers to accept responsibility for programs transmitted with ABC or SBS assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will have flexible licensing powers for limited services. It will retain its powers to refuse to licence a service of the kind applied for and to make program standards for limited licences. It will have to commence inquiries into granting the licence but will be able to terminate those inquiries where it is satisfied that no further investigation is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Only those limited services providing text information will be permitted to broadcast paid advertisements. However, special event and channel sharing services will be allowed to broadcast sponsorship announcements. The prohibition will not prevent remote Aboriginal community licensees retransmitting advertisements included in the host service where no payment or other consideration is received by the licensee community. </PARA>
<PARA> Limited licensees, like other licensees, will be required, as far as possible, to use the services of Australians in the production and presentation of their programs in accordance with section 114 of the Broadcasting Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the essence of limited licences is flexibility-flexibility for the Minister and the Tribunal to consider new, non-commercial forms of broadcasting service; flexibility demanded by technological developments; flexibility long overdue in the labyrinthine Broadcasting Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces temporary transmission and retransmission permit schemes to replace the existing test transmission permits and rebroadcasting and retransmission licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Re-broadcasting and re-transmission licences authorise the retransmission of commercial, public or national broadcasts. The new scheme will consolidate these two categories of `licence' and recognise that, since there is no element of program origination in a retransmitted service, the Tribunal's involvement is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions involved are purely planning and technical and thus fall within the responsibilities of the Minister. Ministerial grant of such `permits' will eliminate the need for double handling between the Minister and the Tribunal. This will substantially speed up the process for small communities who seek to obtain or improve reception of broadcasting services. The scheme will also eliminate the need for broadcasters to have a separate licence to relay their service by cable within their own service area. </PARA>
<PARA> The permits will also cover retransmission outside a licensee's service area to particular persons or classes of persons. No permit will be required to authorise the playing of radio to people held on telephone queues. </PARA>
<PARA> Test transmission permits are granted to existing licensees for testing new technical equipment, to new licensees prior to the formal grant of the licence and to aspirant, generally public, broadcasters who wish to test public reaction to program formats. </PARA>
<PARA> While these may involve some program origination, they involve primarily planning questions and the Tribunal's involvement is generally unnecessary. The new scheme will transfer responsibility to the Minister, with a provision for referral to the Tribunal in appropriate circumstances such as where particular programming issues arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum length of permits will be extended from the existing 7 days to 14 days. Guidelines will be developed in consultation with interested groups to replace the existing Tribunal policy statement and practice note on test transmission permits. </PARA>
<PARA> Fees for limited licences and for retransmission and temporary transmission permits will be introduced under Bills shortly to be introduced. The level of fees has not yet been finalised and will vary with the nature of the service to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Local Origination</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A licensee must currently obtain approval from the Tribunal before it can broadcast different programs from different transmitters within a service area-a practice known as `local origination' and intended to provide more local programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill removes the requirement for prior Tribunal permission to locally originate but makes the practice subject to scrutiny by the Tribunal as part of the assessment of the adequacy and comprehensiveness of a service. This will be a relevant issue at licence renewal inquiries. However, failure to locally originate will not of itself disclose a failure to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a range of mechanisms for delivering services which will be particularly important for remote and regional audiences. Licensees will have more flexibility in providing local origination. Local communities will be able to receive, more quickly, authorisation to establish their own retransmission facilities. Remote Aboriginal and Islander communities will have enormous flexibility in providing services appropriate to their cultural needs and the national broadcasters will be able to consider proposals by limited licensees to share their facilities. Together, these reforms open the door for significant improvements in the range of broadcasting services available to under-served areas. </PARA>
<PARA>ABC Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow the ABC to borrow money from the Commonwealth or other sources with the Finance Minister's or Treasurer's approval respectively and to offer its assets as security. It will permit the Commonwealth to guarantee loans. The Bill also confers powers to enter into hedging contracts to reduce the risks of foreign exchange or interest rate fluctuations and to invest surplus funds in a manner approved by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> These powers are consistent with the greater independence and accountability of the Corporation in financial matters stemming from the Government's decision to introduce three-year funding. They will certainly be of use to the Corporation in financing a number of proposals for development of accommodation in Sydney and Melbourne, amongst others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also greatly simplifies the legislative provisions covering the ABC's staffing matters in line with the Government's policy of streamlining those provisions for independent statutory bodies. The Corporation will continue its endeavours to achieve and maintain high standards as an employer in relation to terms and conditions of employment, occupational health, industrial safety, industrial democracy, non-discriminatory employment practices and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the co-ordination arrangements which apply to all budget-funded agencies, the Corporation and staff organisations will have greater flexibility in negotiating conditions of employment. The Government expects the Corporation to develop and maintain all future employment arrangements in full consultation and negotiation with relevant unions. These arrangements will be incorporated into industrial agreements or awards which will bind the Corporation in the same way as awards bind the Commonwealth, under section 41A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1901. However, this does not mean that the Commission will be arbitrating or interfering in matters which may be properly regarded as coming within managerial prerogative. The staffing provisions will commence on a date to be proclaimed to allow the Corporation and relevant unions time to finalise the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar powers are available to other Commonwealth authorities operating in a competitive environment. The Government believes they will assist in creating a more flexible and efficient ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>Tobacco Advertising</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill extends the current ban on broadcasting advertisements for cigarettes and cigarette tobacco to cover other tobacco products such as cigars, snuff and chewing tobacco. It will bring the advertising requirements in the Broadcasting Act into line with those set out in the guidelines for Video and Audio Entertainment and Information Services currently licensed under the Radiocommunications Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Matters</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will eliminate areas of administrative duplication in a range of routine planning and technical matters and will allow the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to carry out activities incidental to its functions. In particular, the Bill will allow it to provide and market publications and information services and hold conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that the Tribunal may require corporations ``related'' within the meaning of the Companies Code to a licensee corporation, to furnish information about the activities or affairs of the related corporation which is relevant to the operation of the licence fees Acts. A corporation is ``related'' to another if they are subsidiaries, holding companies or joint subsidiaries of a third corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill rectifies a defect in legislation which extends the electoral blackout provisions in the Broadcasting Act to elections for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and such other bodies prescribed by Regulation.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill contains some reorganisation of provisions in the Act covering licensing criteria. These changes have no policy effect and are intended only to make the Act more readable. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There is expected to be some increase in the administrative workload of the Department and the Tribunal resulting from the planning and licensing of new limited services. In the Department, this will be added to by the assumption of responsibility for temporary transmission and retransmission permits, partially offset by savings from simplified planning and technical procedures. Any additional workload will be absorbed within existing resources. The loss of responsibility for test transmission permits and re-broadcasting and re-transmission licences will provide the Tribunal with small but useful administrative savings. These also can be expected in the ABC with simplified staffing provisions and more efficient cash management. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BROADCASTING (LIMITED LICENCES) FEES BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill imposes fees in respect of limited licences granted under the Broadcasting Act 1942 . These fees will be by way of a tax with the amounts to be fixed by regulation. This new category of licence is being introduced into the Broadcasting Act by amendments in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which has just received its second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> Limited licences provide a flexible method of licensing a range of new broadcasting services which do not raise public interest implications of the same magnitude as conventional forms of broadcasting. Consistent with this approach, the limited licence fees Bill provides considerable flexibility in the types of fees which may be set for different forms of limited licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will be able to prescribe fees payable annually or on the grant and renewal of licences. The fees may be set to recover the administrative costs of planning and licensing limited services or to impose charges which ensure that the revenue derived by the Commonwealth properly reflects the value in alternative uses of the frequencies allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will be able to prescribe that fees for the grant of limited licences be set by tender, bidding or auction. In this situation, the choice by the Tribunal of the most suitable applicant for the particular limited licence will be made by selecting the highest suitable bidder. While none of the forms of limited licence expressly mentioned in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill is expected to be allocated in this way, the provisions give flexibility to apply it to future forms of limited licence if the public interest would thus be best served. </PARA>
<PARA> The power to set fees is not mandatory and some forms of limited licence might not attract fees at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations will be made to commence on the date of commencement of this Bill. They will be set at levels consistent with those applying for similar users of the spectrum licensed under the Radiocommunications Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that significant revenue will be generated by the Bill. The precise amounts will depend on the demand for limited licences, which cannot be estimated with any precision. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> BROADCASTING (RETRANSMISSION PERMITS AND TEMPORARY TRANSMISSION PERMITS) FEES BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill imposes fees in respect of retransmission and temporary transmission permits granted under the Broadcasting Act 1942. These fees will be by way of a tax with the amounts to be fixed by regulation. These new categories of permits are being introduced into the Broadcasting Act by amendments in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which has just received its second reading. They replace the existing categories of re-broadcasting and re-transmission licenses and test transmission permits. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations will be made to commence on the date of commencement of this Bill. They will be set at levels consistent with those applying for similar users of the spectrum licensed under the Radiocommunications Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that significant revenue will be generated by the Bill. The precise amounts will depend on the demand for permits. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BROADCASTING (NATIONAL METROPOLITAN RADIO PLAN) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill marks a further phase in the Government's policy of extending greater choice in radio and television services to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It implements the first stage of the national plan for metropolitan radio services which will provide more commercial FM radio outlets in mainland state capital cities and establish AM networks for parliamentary broadcasting and Radio for the Print Handicapped. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan, announced by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Gareth Evans, on 9 August this year, addresses several interlocking issues. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> The general desire by existing AM licensees to convert to FM;</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's wish to extend its JJJ Youth Network and to provide for parliamentary broadcasting in a cost-effective manner which does not disrupt ABC programming;</PARA>
<PARA> The need to expand and improve Radio for the Print Handicapped services; and</PARA>
<PARA> The desirability of reforming the existing system of allocating frequencies for commercial purposes and deriving an appropriate return to the community from the commercial use of a public resource, namely the FM radio spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> The national metropolitan radio plan involves two stages. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the first stage eligible commercial AM licensees will be invited to lodge bids for the right to convert from their existing AM frequencies to FM frequencies. The two highest eligible bidders in each capital city will be selected to convert to the FM frequencies. </PARA>
<PARA> A condition of eligibility for the tender process will be that the successful tenderers must transfer their AM transmission facilities and sites to the Commonwealth for use by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for Parliamentary broadcasts, and by public licensees for Radio for the Print Handicapped purposes. I intend shortly to invite applications for a public radio licence serving Print Handicapped listeners for the first vacated AM channel in each mainland state capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage of the plan will involve invitation for tenders for two new commercial FM Radio licences in each mainland State capital. I intend to bring forward legislation in the autumn sittings 1989 to implement this second stage. This will provide time for more detailed consultation on the process proposed for stage 2. It also will allow these steps to be considered in the context of the review of the Broadcasting Act currently being undertaken by the Department of Transport and Communications, and the current inquiry by the House of Representatives Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee into the role of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the central aims which this Government has consistently pursued in its broadcasting policy have been to maximise diversity of choice in radio and television services and to limit concentration of media ownership and control.</PARA>
<PARA> These objectives are being pursued through a significant expansion of existing services and through the introduction of new, competitive services. In television, the policy of equalisation is bringing new commercial television services to regional areas. We are also well advanced in providing additional commercial radio services in regional areas. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has made decisions on new FM commercial radio licences in Newcastle, Geelong, the Gold Coast, Gosford, Shepparton and Moree. Two supplementary FM licences are on air in Canberra. Tribunal inquiries are under way in Ipswich, Geraldton and Townsville, and will soon begin in Mildura, Hobart, Lismore, Mackay, Renmark, Darwin, Albany, Kempsey and Nowra. The program up to the end of 1990 will bring new commercial radio services to some 4.2 million people. I will soon be announcing a further phase of the program for 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In public radio, at least six to eight new services are being introduced each year whilst the ABC continues to expand its services with the development of the second regional radio network. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this policy of extension of services, the national metropolitan radio plan should increase the diversity of radio services available to listeners in the mainland State capitals. In conjunction with the existing one-to-a-market ownership limit, the entry of new operators into the industry will further diversify the ownership of radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA>Tender Procedures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Minister to invite applications from existing metropolitan commercial AM licensees for conversion to FM. Applications will be submitted to the Tender Board of the Department of Transport and Communications. Applications will include sealed bids and a range of other material detailing the nature and value of the AM transmission facilities which will be provided to the Commonwealth in part satisfaction of that bid. The transmission equipment will need to meet technical standards set by the Minister and the interest in the transmission site will need to be sufficient to ensure continuing delivery of Parliamentary and RPH services. </PARA>
<PARA> The equipment will be valued by the Department and the site by the Australian Valuation Office, with facility for reference to commercial arbitration in the event of disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Bids will be subject to a confidential reserve price established by the Minister. A secure procedure will be followed to ensure that the reserve price remains confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> After the closing date, the Tender Board will examine the applications and reject any which do not meet the prescribed conditions, and provide the Minister with a ranking of applicants whose bids exceed the reserve from the highest bidder down. I will offer FM frequencies to the two highest bidding applicants with the highest bidder having its choice of preferred frequency, subject to normal planning considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the successful applicant defaults, the next highest bidder will be offered a frequency. </PARA>
<PARA> In making offers to the successful applicants, I will advise the date by which the fee as bid must be paid and the AM facilities transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be empowered to re-call tenders if satisfied that there has been collusion in tendering. </PARA>
<PARA>Radio for the Print Handicapped</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> RPH services have been operating unsatisfactorily for some years outside the broadcast band, on low power and with sub-standard equipment. This legislation empowers the Commonwealth to acquire transmission sites and associated AM equipment from existing commercial licensees in part satisfaction of their bid for conversion to FM. The Commonwealth will then lease these facilities to RPH groups at a nominal rent. I will invite applications for a public radio licence to serve print handicapped listeners on the first vacated AM frequency in each mainland State capital. The tender procedure for conversion of AM commercial licensees will ensure that the sites and facilities tendered are adequate to provide an acceptable signal across the metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had previously intended that RPH services would be provided on FM frequencies. However, the technical characteristics of AM are more appropriate to the predominantly spoken word RPH programs and the availability of vacated AM frequencies and facilities from the conversion of AM commercial stations provide an excellent opportunity to improve the quality of existing RPH services in mainland State capitals. The only disadvantage is that AM transmitters are more expensive than FM to operate. The Government will therefore provide a grant of $100,000 per year to meet this extra cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra and Hobart frequencies are available on the FM band and will be allocated in 1990. A capital grant of $600,000 will be provided in 1990-91 to assist the establishment of these two new RPH stations. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Broadcasts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> For many years the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has met its legislative obligation to broadcast parliamentary proceedings. This has been at some cost to the ABC in the development of coherent radio programming and also in building up its audience. This legislation will facilitate the use by the ABC of the sites and facilities of the successful tenderer for the second frequency in each city for the establishment of a parliamentary broadcasting network. The new and permanent network for parliamentary broadcasting will replace the interim parliamentary broadcasting network which is presently being established through the use of the ABC's standby transmission facilities. Following the complete transfer from Radio National to the interim network, the ABC will be able to further develop Radio National as a high quality news and talk service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Extension of the ABC's Youth Network</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An important part of the national plan is the extension of the ABC's JJJ FM service from Sydney to the other capital cities. This initiative links with the Government's recent establishment of the Australian Contemporary Popular Music Development Company. The Youth Network will be financed by the ABC from its existing resources, and requires no legislative amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has no direct financial consequences, because the formal obligation to pay the fees it introduces will be imposed under the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 through amendments introduced in the accompanying Radio Licence Fees (National Metropolitan Radio Plan) Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe this Bill creates new opportunities for commercial radio operators in the mainland capital cities. The ability for some AM stations to convert to FM will help to redress the imbalance between commercial operators using the AM and FM bands. The Government hopes that this will lead to a more dynamic approach to programming, resulting in a more diverse range of services to the community. Commercial broadcasting has shown a capacity to meet changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, the level of competition has increased markedly with the introduction of new commercial radio services, particularly on FM. Competition is likely to intensify as AM stations convert to FM in Stage 1 of the plan and later with the establishment of two additional commercial stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The listening public should welcome the addition of new commercial FM services as testified by the success of existing commercial FM stations. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>RADIO LICENCE FEES (NATIONAL METROPOLITAN RADIO PLAN) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill formally imposes the obligation to pay the fee on conversion from AM to FM broadcasting by large city commercial radio licensees determined in accordance with the tender process introduced in the Broadcasting (National Metropolitan Radio Plan) Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> It is purely a machinery Bill and all the relevant policy elements are covered by the accompanying Broadcasting Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial Implications</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The first stage of the National Plan, implemented in this Bill and the accompanying Broadcasting (National Metropolitan Radio Plan Bill) 1988, is expected to produce net revenue of $79.9m over the five years from 1988-89 to 1992-93, with an on-going annual additional cost of $0.2m. This comprises revenue from tendering for AM/FM conversion, partially offset by the costs of retaining vacated AM sites and facilities for Parliamentary and Radio for the Print Handicapped Networks and some small additional capital and recurrent outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> A $0.6m capital grant will be provided in 1990-91 for the establishment of FM RPH stations in Canberra and Hobart. The Appropriation Bills provide for an ongoing annual subsidy to RPH of $100,000 to meet the additional cost of maintaining AM rather than FM facilities, and an increase in the grant-in-aid for RPH from $25,000 to $125,000 per annum. They also provide for additional Departmental administration expenses of $400,000 in 1988-89. An additional $100,000 will be required in 1989-90. </PARA>

<PARA> Other 1988 May economic statement income tax measures contained in the Bill will reduce the rate of deduction for investment in Australian films from 120 per cent to 100 per cent, and modify the imputation provisions as they relate to dividends paid before 1 July 1989 by early balancing companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget measures contained in the Bill which provide a rebate of tax for lump sum payments in arrears of certain kinds of income, and deductibility for gifts to the Australian National Gallery Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments of the income tax law proposed by this Bill will ensure that certain `prepaid' research and development expenditure will be deductable over the period during which relevant services are provided, and will exempt certain cash grants made under the defence service homes scheme. Some minor amendments are also proposed to the fringe benefits tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill contains measures to clarify the refund provisions of the sales tax law. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Exemption for Goldmining Income</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the 1988 May economic statement, the Bill will remove the current exemption from taxation of income from goldmining, subject to certain phasing-in arrangements. The Government will honour its commitment to the gold industry by allowing the existing exemption to apply until 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> From that date, the Bill will terminate the tax exemption of income from goldmining; and the exemption for income derived from the sale of gold by the Gold Producers Association Ltd. The impact of these changes will be further eased by allowing certain expenditures incurred prior to 1 January 1991 to be carried forward for deduction after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Bill contains transitional arrangements to calculate notional deductions for capital expenditure incurred by goldminers prior to 1 January 1991 in order to determine actual deductions for such expenditure from that date for goldminers that continue to be engaged in mining operations. Notional deductions will be calculated either on the basis of write-off rates specified in the mining provisions of the income tax law or the 5/3 accelerated depreciation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A separate transitional arrangement will apply to exploration expenditure for gold incurred between 25 May 1988 and 1 January 1991 which will be carried forward and deducted against income from 1 January 1991 for up to seven years from the year in which it is incurred. As is the case in relation to claims for deductions for expenses generally, claims by goldminers for deductions allowed under the transitional arrangements will need to be supported by adequate records. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax exemption for income from the sale of rights to mine for gold by bona fide prospectors will be retained, subject to an amendment to confine the exemption to arm's length transactions, as for other minerals. Also consistent with the existing law, the amount of exploration expenditure carried forward during the transitional period will be appropriately reduced in the event of a tax exempt sale of a mining right before 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of other goldmining assets acquired after 19 September 1985, the capital gains tax will only apply to that part of any gain on disposal of such an asset that accrues after 31 December 1990. This will ensure that any capital gains tax liability on disposal of such assets is entirely prospective. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to income derived or expenditure incurred from 1 January 1991, goldminers will otherwise be subject to tax on the same basis as other miners.</PARA>
<PARA> These changes are expected to produce revenue savings of $870m in 1991-92 and $300m per annum in later income years. </PARA>
<PARA>Lump Sum Payments in Arrears</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for a rebate of tax to be allowed where certain income accrued in years earlier than the year of receipt is received in a lump sum. The rebate will limit the tax payable on the arrears component of the lump sum to an amount comparable to the tax that would have been payable if the income had been received when it accrued. </PARA>
<PARA> Lump sum payments of workers and accident compensation, certain pensions, benefits and allowances and, in limited circumstances, payments of salary or wages will be eligible for the rebate. At present, such lump sums are wholly taxable as income of the year in which they are received and this can result in taxpayers paying a higher amount of tax than if the income had been received in each of the years in which it accrued. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will be available for lump sums received on or after 1 July 1986 where the amount of the accrued income is not less than 10 per cent of the taxpayer's taxable income of the year of receipt, as adjusted for certain kinds of income of an irregular nature. The kind of income that will be excluded in applying the eligibility test are those parts of the lump sums that accrued in prior years together with any capital gains, abnormal income or lump sums paid on termination of employment. The rebate will be calculated by reference to the income of the two most recent years, prior to the year of receipt, over which the lump sum accrued. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the lump sum accrued no earlier than those two years the taxation position of a taxpayer as a consequence of the rebate will be the same as if the income had been received in the income years in which it accrued. Where the lump sum accrued over a longer period, the tax payable in respect of the arrears that accrued in those earlier years will be determined broadly on the basis of the rates of tax that would have been borne in the two most recent years before the year of receipt. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of providing this rebate is $3m in 1988-89 and $1m in subsequent financial years. </PARA>
<PARA>Employee Share Acquisition Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives effect to the proposal announced in the 1988 May economic statement to exclude from income tax up to $200 of discounts on shares or rights acquired by employees under certain employee share acquisition schemes. To qualify for the proposed exclusion, the employee share acquisition scheme will need to be open, on a non-discriminatory basis, to all full time or permanent part time employees of at least 12 months service. In addition, shares or rights acquired under a scheme will need to be held for a minimum of three years except where employment terminates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also ensure that, for capital gains tax purposes, the cost base of the shares or rights will be reduced by any discount that is excluded from assessable income. These changes will apply to shares or rights acquired on or after 1 July 1988, and are expected to have a revenue cost of $5m for each of the first three years, but to decline in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Transitional Imputation Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the transitional measures announced by the Treasurer in the 1988 May economic statement to prevent franked dividends, paid by early balancing companies with imputation credits calculated on the basis of the 39 per cent company tax rate, from being channelled through later balancing companies which, as the law presently stands, could effectively pass those dividends on to individual shareholders with higher imputation credits based on the 49 per cent company tax rate. This situation will be addressed by deeming dividends paid by early balancing companies between 1 January and 30 June 1989 to a resident company that could pay dividends franked on the basis of the 49 per cent company tax rate to be received by that company, for imputation purposes, on the first day of the franking year that corresponds to its 1989-90 tax year, generally 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, however, the company receiving dividends that have been affected by the deeming provisions has a franking deficit at the end of its 1988-89 franking year, the Bill allows these dividends to be applied to the reduction or elimination of that deficit. Where necessary, up to two-thirds of such dividends may be applied against the franking deficit in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall cost of the reduction of the company tax, excluding life companies, with which this transitional measure is associated, is $110m in 1988-89 and $1,850m in  1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Prepaid Research and Development Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will change the timing of deductions for research and development expenditure that is incurred in advance of the provision of the services to which the expenditure relates. Instead of being fully deductable when incurred, deductions for the expenditure will be pro rated over the period during which the services are provided. Immediate deductibility will continue to be available if all of the services are provided within 13 months of incurring the expenditure; if the expenditure is less than $1,000 or if it is required to be incurred by law. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, preferred treatment will be given to expenditure incurred to an approved research institute or a registered research agency, and to expenditure incurred on syndication projects for which a company is registered by the industry research and development board. For expenditure of this kind, deductions that would be allowable in the second and subsequent years of income will be advanced to the preceding year of income. The amendments will apply to expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Films</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As part of the restructuring of the Government's support for the film industry, the Bill reduces the deduction for investments in qualifying Australian films from 120 per cent to 100 per cent, with no exemption from tax for income from such investments. The reduction, which was announced by the Treasurer in the 1988 May economic statement, will apply to expenditure under contracts entered into on or after 25 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains transitional provisions to preserve temporarily the higher rates of deduction for films substantially in production or underwritten before 25 May 1988, provided that certain conditions are met. The estimated cost of the proposed amendments is $90m over a four-year period commencing with the 1989-90 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Future Government assistance to the film industry will be given primarily through the Australian Film Finance Corporation Pty Ltd, which has been established as a wholly Commonwealth owned company to fund qualifying Australian films. </PARA>
<PARA>Corporate Restructure (Debt Creation) Rules</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will effect a minor amendment to the income tax law to correct a technical deficiency in the corporate restructure debt creation rules which, it is argued, presently grant an exemption from the legislation in a way that was not intended. The amendment will ensure that the exempting provisions do not extend to corporate restructure arrangements under which shares held by a non-resident in one resident company are sold to another company controlled by the non-resident. </PARA>
<PARA> Although designed to do no more than clarify the intended operation of the debt creation rules that apply from 1 July 1987, to remove any suggestion of retrospectivity, this measure will apply to relevant transactions entered into after 3 November 1988. This change will have a negligible impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the Budget, this Bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts made on and after 26 September 1988 to the Australian National Gallery Foundation. The estimated cost of admitting the foundation to the gift provisions is $500,000 in 1988-89 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Cash Grants under the Defence Service Homes Scheme</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from income tax certain cash payments made instead of low interest mortgage loans under the defence service homes scheme. The payments were made under transitional arrangements that applied between 16 September 1987 and 9 December 1987 inclusive. The cost to revenue of the exemption is estimated to be $350,000 in 1988-89 and $50,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains some minor fine-tuning amendments of the fringe benefits tax law that are of a concessional nature in relation to the operation of the so-called `otherwise-deductable' rule. These amendments will have negligible revenue effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax Refund</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the refund provisions of the sales tax law will be clarified to ensure that, where tax has been passed on to customers, refunds of overpaid tax are available only if the person who ultimately bore the tax has been recompensed. </PARA>

<PARA>INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the proposal announced in the 1988 may economic statement to reduce the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to declare the rates of income tax payable for the 1989-90 and subsequent financial years by companies and by trustees of corporate union trusts and public trading trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> Income tax at the declared rate of 39 per cent will be payable on incomes of the 1988-89 and subsequent financial years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first words of this speech are indeed interesting. I take great pleasure in introducing the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill to the Senate. Honourable senators will have seen from a quick glance at this Bill that its basic purpose is to provide for a new Federal road funding program from 1 January 1989, to replace both of the Government's current programs. However, a closer reading reveals that the Bill contains important new initiatives which distinguish it from previous roads programs. To a greater extent than any of its predecessors, the Australian centennial roads development (ACRD) program looks to the economic future of Australia. As its title implies, this legislation will set the direction of road funding towards the year 2001-the centenary of our Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently, the Government's economic agenda is focusing closely on the need for structural adjustment of our major industries. The improvement of our land transport sector is an integral part of this structural adjustment process. Cheaper, safer and more efficient transport can mean only greater success in our attempts to make our industries more competitive. The clear message for all levels of government is that land transport development needs to blend more closely with economic policy. If Australia is to continue to improve its economic performance we cannot afford to ignore this. In the area of roads funding, this requirement is absolutely essential. Roads play a pivotal role in Australia's transport system. About half of all freight transport takes place on roads and if we exclude low value bulk commodities the figure is over 80 per cent. In addition, over 97 per cent of passenger travel is by road. Given these statistics, it is important that we take a long hard look at roads development. With all levels of government coming to grips with the need for economic restraint it is imperative that scarce roads infrastructure be effectively targeted. Only in this way can we ensure the sorts of economic and social benefits we are aiming for. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, much has already been achieved by this Government in the roads sphere. Despite the tough economic climate that has prevailed over the last few years, we have managed to establish an impressive record on the road funding front. Over the six Hawke Government Budgets since 1983, we have allocated more than $7 billion to road funding, an increase in real terms of 21 per cent over the last six Budgets of the Fraser Administration. More importantly, we have made effective and sensible use of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985, for example, we introduced the Australian land transport program (ALTP). This program broke new ground by presenting a more comprehensive approach to land transport funding with money provided from a share of fuel excise. We have also witnessed the rapid development of our national highway system. This impressive network serves a vital role for the economic and social roads needs of this nation. More and more Australians are remarking on the progress we have made on the national highway. Over recent years we have achieved significant upgrading of the important Sydney to Melbourne link as well as completion of sealing on the Adelaide to Darwin and Brisbane to Darwin sections. These developments are not only providing safer and more efficient transport but are going a long way to bringing our communities closer together. This Government is proud of its roads achievement to date. But it also realises that much more has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill takes a realistic approach to our roads objectives. The program that it enacts will ensure that we not only look to the roads demands of the future but also provide for the maintenance of our existing roads assets. The new arrangements will replace both of our current Federal road funding programs. Most honourable senators will be aware that the Australian bicentennial road development (ABRD) program expires at the end of this year. While the Australian land transport program was not due to finish until mid-1990, it makes administrative sense to have one single program in place from 1989. The Bill itself is the culmination of a detailed Government review earlier this year of Federal road funding arrangements. This review consulted with all major interest groups including State and local government, major road transport bodies and motorist organisations. What was uppermost in mind when conducting the review and subsequently framing this legislation was the need to have careful regard to the relationship between road funding and economic policy. It is a mistake to consider road funding in isolation from the general economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I outlined earlier, one of the Government's principal economic consideration at the present time is the implementation of a process of structural adjustment designed to make our key export and import competing industries more efficient and competitive and so improve longer term security. Federal roads investment can make a major contribution to this process of structural adjustment. But, having said this, the other important economic factor to keep in mind is the pressing need for expenditure restraint. The halcyon times of the 1950s and 1960s are over. We all need to face the fact that funding available for roads development is limited. The new ACRD program clearly reflects these economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, funds are to be concentrated on roads of national economic significance. In particular, the Bill provides for a new category of what are called `national arterials', designed to improve road access for our major industries. The second principal aim of the Bill is to get better value for every dollar spent of roads. To this end, the program provides for revised administrative arrangements based on a quality assurance approach and reduced Federal involvement. The States will assume greater responsibility and accountability for ensuring projects are completed on budget and to an appropriate standard. These arrangements will guarantee efficiency in the delivery of the new road program. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me first turn to roads of national economic importance. Until now, the national highway system has provided significant assistance to economic growth by making freight movements faster, cheaper and safer. Funding for this category will continue under the new program so that its benefits can be preserved. However, we need to realise that the national highway is predominantly an inter-capital link. It does not encompass the major feeder routes into and out of these capital cities, nor does it include connections to some of our important manufacturing and primary production centres. What we need to do therefore is build on the achievements of the national highway. For this reason we have introduced the new national arterial category. National arterials will encompass roads which can be shown specifically to enhance the domestic and export competitiveness of Australian industry. To this end, the category will fund projects on key routes linking areas of production with ports, airports, freight forwarding centres, rail freight terminals and terminii of key arterial roads. These new routes will also provide interstate and international travellers with easier access to tourist areas. </PARA>
<PARA> One important proviso to the inclusion of projects in the new national arterial category is the requirement that all routes have an advantageous benefit-cost ratio. While everyone may not be happy with this approach, it is nevertheless one of the best single indicators of the economic merit of projects. It also goes hand in hand with the overriding need to obtain more value from less resources. Over the last few months State and Territory governments have been undertaking the process of identifying candidate routes in consultation with Federal officials. The introduction of the national arterial category marks a `great leap forward' for roads development in Australia. Together with the national highway system it gives a clear statement of our national road funding objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this emphasis on roads of national economic significance, the program also continues a base level of assistance for State arterial and local roads. Local road funding has fared particularly well under the new program with funding being maintained in real terms in 1988-89 at $268.5m, excluding the $4m allocated to Australian Capital Territory (ACT) local roads. This represents more than a $15m increase over 1987-88 expenditure and clearly reflects this Government's continuing commitment to assisting local government to meet its road responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let me turn to the funding provisions of the Bill as set out in part II. The Government announced in this year's May economic statement that Federal assistance for roads in 1988-89 would be set at $1,215m. While this represents a slight fall on the previous year's level, the Government has guaranteed that the 1988-89 figure will be maintained in real terms over 1989-90 and 1990-91. Unlike the Opposition we have been prepared to set out our funding commitment to roads over the next few years. Honourable senators will have noted that, for the first time, the Australian Capital Territory is to be incorporated into Federal road funding arrangements. The announced 1988-89 funding level of $1,215m does not include the ACT funding requirement. Total funding in 1988-89 under the three road programs will be $1,221.5m including $6.5m for the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding mechanisms under this Bill are similar to current arrangements. As with the ABRD program and the ALTP before it, revenue for this new program will be paid into a special trust fund, operating from 1 January 1989 to the completion of the program on 31 December 1993. Funds will be raised by earmarking a proportion of net receipts from excise levied on motor spirit and diesel. To guarantee the integrity of this revenue, the Bill provides for the amount of excise receipts to be specifically designated as a road user charge. This will enable road users to clearly identify the amount of excise that is devoted to roads. The initial excise charge rate operating under the program will be 4.95c per litre. The rate will be indexed to movements in the implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product for the second and third years of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for two other important types of charge rate adjustments. The first of these seeks to overcome any transitional funding problems that may arise in 1988-89 by ensuring that the guaranteed funding level of $1,221.5m will actually be available for expenditure. A further adjustment gives legislative backing to the Government's guarantee that the 1988-89 funding level will be maintained in real terms over the following two financial years. Considered together, these adjustments guarantee a secure funding environment for Governments and others involved in finding the money for roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding provided under the program will be available for both construction and maintenance work on national highways, State arterials and local roads. National arterial funding will be restricted to construction purposes only. As with current arrangements, the program adopts a comprehensive approach to land transport funding. Accordingly, the Bill continues the arrangement whereby a proportion of arterial funds, both national and State, may be redirected to either urban public transport projects or capital projects associated with the operation of interstate mainline railways. The level of funding available for urban public transport and rail projects will be approximately the same as was available under current programs. An amount of $6m will be also available for payment to organisations associated with road safety activities and land transport research. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of specific State allocations for designated categories are provided within the Bill for State arterials and local roads. Allocations for national highways, national arterials and road safety and research are to be based on national priorities and will therefore be a matter for ministerial determination. In accordance with this latter provision we have announced that funding in 1988-89 will be set at $484.9m for national highways and $160m for national arterials. States and the Northern Territory have been advised of their individual allocations for these categories. Over subsequent years of the program, the proportion of funding directed to national arterials will increase, reflecting the growing significance of this category. State and category allocations are set out in sections 16 and 17 and schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill and are divided into two distinct time periods. The first of these relates to the 1988-89 financial year with allocations shown as money amounts. Separating out this period will simplify administration during the transitional period as it involves the closure of the ABRD and ALTP trust funds and the commencement of the ACRD fund. It also provides States with assured cash allocations for 1988-89 prior to receipt of final revenues into the ABRD and ALTP funds. The second period covers the remainder of the program from 1 July 1989 with State and category allocations for State arterials and local roads. Maximum percentages have been set for amounts payable under these categories in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Before continuing let me make a few comments about prescribed allocations under the Bill. In the case of arterial funding, honourable senators will note that assistance for State arterials in 1988-89 has been set at $298.1m, including the ACT. While this figure on its own may seem a little low it does not mean that the share of arterial funding has fallen. To obtain the full arterial picture, the allocation for State arterials needs to be taken in conjunction with that for national arterials. Seen from this perspective, the proportion of funding directed to arterial roads has increased marginally over 1987-88 expenditure and represents about 37 per cent of total funding. The major difference is a heavier emphasis on those arterial roads which are more closely related to national economic objectives. As applies under current Federal road funding arrangements, the distribution of local road funds by a State to local authorities will be determined on the basis of approved principles. These principles, which take account of such factors as population and road length, are agreed between the States and relevant local government associations. From the Federal Government's viewpoint, these arrangements have been working well to date. Finally, in relation to funding matters, the Bill allows for ministerial approval of transfers of money between certain categories. As with current arrangements this will ensure a degree of flexibility within the program. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to parts III and IV of the Bill, which deal with administrative arrangements. As I outlined earlier, the administrative arrangements described in this Bill and relevant notes on administration represent a significant change from previous programs. In framing these arrangements our main goal was to achieve improved administrative efficiency and so ensure maximum value for each Federal road dollar. In keeping with this objective, new arrangements make a clear distinction between administrative requirements for national roads and those for State and local roads. This Government has consistently held the view that State arterial and local roads are a State and local government responsibility and it should be left to these governments to determine their own expenditure priorities. Under the new program there is to be minimal Federal involvement in the administration of funding for these roads. In the case of national highways and national arterial roads, however, it is imperative to have an administrative system in place which will ensure national standards and objectives are being met on time and within budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new program, an important element of this approach will be the introduction of a quality assurance system. States have acknowledged the need to employ quality assurance systems, and the spirit of co- operation between the States and Federal Government on their development has been very good. In essence, the quality assurance approach will enable the Federal Government to satisfy itself that the practices and procedures employed by State and Territory authorities and contractors are efficient from a planning, engineering, administrative and financial perspective. Once this system of quality control is set up periodic assessments will be used to ensure that State and Territory systems continue to perform satisfactorily. A prime element of the quality systems approach will be the introduction of pavement management systems by the States for national highways. This will enable a predictable system of road restoration to be established and ensure that we are spending our roads dollar in the right place at the right time. Quality assurance will allow State road authorities to adopt a more businesslike approach to road construction. Indeed, in some cases, States have already pursued this approach of their own accord. Quality assurance is simply one more step towards the Bill's aim of achieving more for less. </PARA>
<PARA> Having explained the basic framework of the revised administrative arrangements, let me briefly outline the remaining significant provisions within the Bill. In accordance with the objectives I have just described, project approval requirements will focus principally on national highways and national arterials, and will not be necessary for expenditure on State arterial or local roads. Arrangements are being developed in cooperation with the States to improve cost estimation procedures and minimise cost overruns. Project approval will continue to apply to both mainline railway projects and urban public transport projects. In the case of mainline railways, funding will be dependent on the project being able to yield significant benefits based on improvements in the capacity, quality or efficiency of operations. Urban public transport projects will aim to reduce traffic on arterial roads in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Tendering requirements will apply to the construction of national highways and national arterials and will now be extended to include major rehabilitation works on national highways. For tendering purposes, major rehabilitation works will cover off those works estimated to cost in excess of $2m. Where appropriate, tendering will also apply to mainline railway and urban transport projects. Administrative measures are also being put in place in relation to tendering procedures to reduce the scope for litigation over the final cost of projects. The program will maintain the requirement that State and Territory Governments together with local authorities acknowledge Federal assistance for programs and projects. The Bill also prevents States from levying tolls on national highways or national arterial roads without written ministerial consent. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill makes provision for the closing of the existing trust funds under the ABRD program and ALTP by 30 April 1989. No excise payments will be made into these funds after 31 December 1988 and special transitional arrangements will apply to moneys paid out of these funds between 1 January and 30 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, let me reiterate that the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill is the right response for the economic times of today. It is a balanced and responsible approach to the question of road funding which dovetails neatly with the Government's overall economic strategy. Like all good money managers we have carefully considered our objectives and priorities and then chosen sound investments to match. Initiatives such as the introduction of national arterials and the establishment of quality systems are integral elements of this roads investment package designed to make the roads dollar work harder. There is no doubt that the Government's investments will pay handsome dividends. Not only will these efforts assist our export and import competing industries but there will also be significant benefits for the truckie, the farmer, the motorist-in fact, all roads users. </PARA>
<PARA> The current reassessment of Federal road funding forms part of the Government's wider agenda for restructuring in all sectors of the transport industry-road, rail, sea and air. Together these reforms are helping to develop a more efficient, more competitive industry to the betterment of Australia's overall economic performance. In the long run, this will mean greater benefits for all Australians. I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme outlined in this Bill represent a landmark both with respect to structural adjustment policy and to the management of Commonwealth/State programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will serve two purposes. It will allow the Rural Adjustment Scheme to operate in a more flexible and innovative way so as to more adequately address the changing structural adjustment forces acting on businesses in the Australian agricultural sector. It will also set in place innovative arrangements for the management of Commonwealth/State programs. Under these arrangements the Commonwealth's role will be restricted to setting broad policy guidelines. The States will have total managerial and financial responsibility. They will only be accountable to the Commonwealth for the effective achievement of the Scheme's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> In a structural adjustment policy sense the Bill recognises that structural adjustment arises from a whole spectrum of reasons ranging from the adoption of exciting new computer and biological technologies through to the painful process of facilitating the exit from the sector of producers who are no longer viable. Adjustment has become an increasingly more significant issue for the farm business because of the greater degree of volatility of external factors it is now likely to face. This volatility arises from a host of circumstances including variability in world commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates and climatic conditions. Rigid policy responses and smothering administrative regulations cannot cope with this type of variability. Flexibility and adaptability of policy responses are essential in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also aims at ensuring that structural adjustment assistance does not centre around the provision of short term quick fix solutions or on the treatment of symptoms. Rather, it aims to ensure that attention is given to the longer term result and the causes of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> To accomplish these two aspects the Agreement, which is a Schedule to the Bill, sets out clearly defined purposes, objectives and strategies which directly address these aims. Commonwealth and State Ministers will meet annually to determine the priorities for the provision of structural adjustment assistance. They will determine which industries are in particular need of adjustment assistance at any time and, if necessary, the types of farm build-up and farm improvement activities which should receive priority attention. For example, if a series of widespread good years has occurred, Ministers may decide to emphasise the provision of assistance for drought proofing or soil conservation measures directed at giving businesses in the agricultural sector the long term capacity to accommodate climatic variations within their normal operations. Provided productive activities of this type can be identified and implemented, Commonwealth funding of the Scheme need not necessarily decline in good times when demand for funds, due to the impact of variability of costs and output, declines. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that a long term approach is adopted, the legislation retains the previous Commonwealth commitment to provide funds for seven years. The Commonwealth and the States have developed a range of policy measures with each State having the freedom to choose which measures it will use. For example, some States may wish to engage in limited land trading to facilitate the exit of non-viable farmers from the industry or farm build-up. Other States may decide not to utilise that particular policy measure. The Bill also allows for new policy measures to be developed and implemented in the future to meet changing needs and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Commonwealth will be to develop, in consultation with the States, Ministerial determinations which will set out the broad policy parameters to be applied to each policy instrument. It will be up to the States to develop the management guidelines to govern the use of each policy instrument. This legislation will also allow for variation between the States in the management procedures adopted with respect to specific policy measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The third key policy aspect is that there is to be a much stronger emphasis on the notion that farming is first and foremost a business-a business which must be run along sound business management lines if it is to survive and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> Two provisions are made in the Bill specifically to facilitate meeting this objective. Training for farmers is recognised as an appropriate activity to be funded under the Scheme. In addition, provision is made for ongoing funding to improve the quality of financial analysis which is undertaken before assistance is provided to the farmer. In this context, the Bill aims to ensure that the real causes of a farmer's business problems are identified before assistance is provided. Hopefully, this type of analysis will also allow the States to:</PARA>
<PARA> integrate the provision of assistance to farm businesses from a number of sources such as the Rural Adjustment Scheme, State extension services, rural counsellors and private financing bodies; and</PARA>
<PARA> use a number of the Scheme's assistance measures together, in conjunction with each other, more effectively in order to address the adjustment needs of particular farm businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>The other adjustment policy measure incorporated in the legislation which deserves special mention is the new arrangement for the provision of re-establishment assistance under Part C of the Scheme. The new arrangement will enable farmers, whose businesses are clearly not capable of surviving without assistance into the long term, to leave the sector with dignity and to provide a base from which to establish themselves once they have left farming.</PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate less traumatic and more dignified adjustment the legislation provides for the payment of a re-establishment grant of up to $28,000 to a farmer leaving the sector. This amount is indexed annually and subject to an assets test (excluding personal effects). A farmer will be able to leave the sector with a maximum of $28,000 of assets plus $28,000 re-establishment grant. As the value of assets rises above $28,000 the re-establishment grant will decline on a dollar for dollar basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In association with this, the provision of household support assistance under Part C will be changed in a number of ways including making it available for a maximum of two years. Commonwealth and State Ministers considered this period allowed more than enough time for the farmer, once he or she has taken the decision to leave farming, to sell the business. It was felt that the old arrangements were having a negative adjustment impact and, in some circumstances, may have been eroding the capital base of the farmer's business. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, structural adjustment policy is not the only matter addressed by the Bill. It is also a landmark piece of legislation in terms of being the first attempt at applying, in the context of co-operative Commonwealth-State relations, the principles of devolution of financial management encapsulated in concepts such as program budgeting and the financial management improvement program. </PARA>
<PARA> To implement this devolution, the legislation and Agreement:</PARA>
<PARA> include a clear mission statement for the Rural Adjustment Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> provide for the State rural adjustment authority to have sole responsibility for the management and administration of the policy measures available under the Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> provide for the State rural adjustment authority to have total freedom, within the bounds of responsible financial administration, to manage funds provided for the purpose of the Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> provide for the establishment of a Management Information System to meet the States' own management requirements and to allow them to report to the Commonwealth on the effectiveness of the Scheme's operations. </PARA>
<PARA>This approach has been adopted because it has been demonstrated, by the experience of the last three years, that it is impractical for the Commonwealth to control the detailed financial and managerial operations of the State adjustment authorities. As a corollary to these changes it may, of course, be necessary for the States to improve the quality of resources available to their adjustment authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The mission statement contained in the statement of purposes and objectives set out in the Agreement will, as I have already pointed out, change the policy focus of the Scheme. It will aid more effective operation and management of the Scheme. It will allow ends and means to be more directly related. It will allow for more efficient usage of funds. It will also aid the States in their accounting to the Commonwealth for the effective operation of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will allow the State adjustment authorities maximum management freedom. Policy guidelines will be determined by the Commonwealth; the responsibility for establishing and operating the management arrangements for effectively implementing these policies so as to achieve the Scheme's objectives will rest with the States. The Commonwealth will not have any part to play in the management process but it will participate in regular meetings of State adjustment authority officers to provide for exchanges of information on management priorities and hence the more effective operation of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The financial management of funds provided under the Scheme will also rest entirely with State adjustment authorities. They will, of course, need to have their annual accounts audited by a registered auditor in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. The radical degree of financial and managerial freedom allowed to State adjustment authorities under the legislation will, no doubt, require auditors to consider carefully the nature of the auditing activities they undertake. Equally, I expect that State adjustment authorities will incorporate adequate fraud control measures into their managerial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, as part of this greater financial management freedom, will allow the State adjustment authorities to retain, within the Scheme, current and future surpluses earned under the Scheme and will require them to take over responsibility for the provision of funds to meet possible bad debts incurred under the Scheme since its inception in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The last aspect of greater financial freedom for the State adjustment authorities will result form the States being given a single pool of funds under Part A of the Scheme. The Commonwealth will no longer determine the proportions of funds to be used for particular types of activity under the Scheme. It will not set nominal maximum interest rates for the use of Part A funds. Also, where appropriate, there will be greater freedom for Part A funds to be used to facilitate adjustment under Part C of the Scheme. In this context, I have in mind the new policy provisions for land trading on a limited scale. </PARA>
<PARA> State Ministers have accepted that the greater degree of policy flexibility and the total managerial and financial freedom allowed under this legislation, carries with it the responsibility to ensure, and account for, the effective achievement of the Scheme's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress too much this requirement for accountability. A State which misuses this freedom, for example, to distort the Scheme's objectives or to shift the risk of other State activities onto the Scheme, will lose access to Commonwealth funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason, and also to facilitate more efficient management by State adjustment authorities, that the Commonwealth and the States have agreed to set up a compatible Management Information System for the Scheme. Under this arrangement the States will provide the Commonwealth with data on the operations and finances of the Scheme in an electronic form. This will considerably reduce the State adjustment authorities' reporting workload. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will undertake its own analysis of this data to evaluate the effectiveness of the Scheme's operations. The reports prepared as a result of this work will be provided to the State adjustment authorities and where appropriate to the Commonwealth Auditor-General, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> Three provisions of the new Bill will impact on the amount of funds provided to the States under the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional $1.2 million will be provided in 1988-89 to allow the States to improve the quality of financial analysis which is undertaken before assistance is provided to the farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements for Part C will mean some reduction in household support payments but larger payment for re-establishment assistance. It is not possible to assess how these two factors will balance out but it should be noted that funding for Part C remains open-ended. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements for meeting State administrative expenses are expected to result in a saving to the Commonwealth of $0.4 million in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> New Part A funding will remain unchanged in 1988-89 at $6.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing I would like to make three other points. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to congratulate the consulting firm Coopers and Lybrand W. D. Scott for the excellent report they prepared reviewing the existing arrangements for the operation of the Rural Adjustment Scheme. That report played a key part in the development of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to reiterate that the purpose of this Scheme is to allow effective structural adjustment to take place in farm business enterprises. It is not aimed at keeping farmers on the land. Using the Scheme to prop up farm businesses that are not viable in the long term is not on. The Scheme is aimed at making farm businesses independent of assistance as soon as possible or, if this cannot occur, help farmers to leave the sector with dignity. The retention of farming as a desirable lifestyle will be a result of effective management of farm businesses and effective adjustment, not an objective of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would point out that this Scheme is only part of a package of measures, pursued both at the Commonwealth and the State level, to achieve effective adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Commonwealth level other measures which are part of the agricultural adjustment process include tariff adjustment, the funding of research and development, assistance for education in rural areas, the rural counselling scheme, Country Link and the Country Towns Water Supply Improvement Program. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also relevant programs at the State level; for example, extension services have a key role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill is intended to provide the legal procedures that will apply to Government acquisition activities in the transition from the operation of the current Act, the Lands Acquisition Act 1955, and the commencement of the Lands Acquisition Act 1988. Provision is also made in the legislation for amendments to be made to existing Acts where necessary so that the existing powers and functions of authorities under their enabling legislation is not affected. </PARA>
<PARA> In my second reading speech to Parliament on the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 I identified significant benefits to individuals that can be expected to occur as a result of passage into law of the new lands acquisition legislation. You will be aware that the legislation in general provides for the acquisition process:</PARA>
<PARA> to be more open to public scrutiny;</PARA>
<PARA> to provide individual landowners rights of appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal of the decision to acquire the land;</PARA>
<PARA> to require that Commonwealth acquiring authorities meet set time limits in carrying out acquisition activities; and</PARA>
<PARA> to provide landowners recourse to more comprehensive compensation provisions in respect of Commonwealth acquisition activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 has the interests of individuals as its primary focus. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that the benefits of the new provisions of that Bill should be applied as soon as possible to landowners affected by Commonwealth acquisition initiatives. This Bill has been drafted to give effect to that intention by applying the provisions of the new Act as much as possible to acquisitions initiated but not completed by the Commonwealth under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity to comment on some provisions of the Bill which most exemplify the Government's intentions in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 7 and 8 are probably the most significant clauses in the Bill. They provide that where the Commonwealth has initiated action to acquire an interest in land but negotiations have not been concluded and the interest has not been acquired by the time the 1988 Act commences, then those acquisitions will be undertaken according to the 1988 Act. This applies to acquisitions both by agreement and by compulsory process and implies for example that the property owners would be issued with a pre acquisition declaration giving them the right to appeal the decision to acquire their properties. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill also provides that where an owner's land was compulsorily acquired after 25 May 1988 even if the acquisition had been completed under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 compensation will be assessed according to the provisions of the 1988 Act. If compensation has already been assessed and paid according to the 1955 Act and the owner would be entitled to a greater amount of compensation under the provisions of the new legislation compared to the amount applicable under the 1955 Act then this additional amount will be paid to the owner. </PARA>
<PARA> The specified date in this provision is pertinent because it was on that date that the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 was introduced into Parliament identifying the proposed new compensation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 9 of the Bill provides that persons whose land the Commonwealth had entered onto and/or temporarily occupied in the three year period prior to repeal of the 1955 Act will be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 1988 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Commonwealth compulsorily acquires property in some instances the former owner is able to remain in possession for a time. This is provided for in a general way in the 1955 Act but the details of any agreement are typically arranged between the Commonwealth and the former owner on an individual case basis. The 1988 Act makes specific provision for this to happen and section 11 of this Bill provides that persons in possession of such land under an agreement with the Commonwealth immediately before the commencement of the 1988 Act will have extended to them the protection of the more detailed occupancy provisions of section 47 of the 1988 Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also amends several existing acts. The general intention behind most of those amendments is to retain the status quo in terms of ministerial responsibilities. The need arises because the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 is far more precise than the 1955 Act in specifying what activities will be bound by it with exceptions having to be precisely identified. </PARA>
<PARA> In some other instances the amendments substitute a reference to the 1988 Act for a reference to the 1955 Act. I would like however to make some broad observations about particular categories of legislation and the relationship of those Acts to the Lands Acquisition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that there is a group of Acts being amended by this Bill which deal with Aboriginal communities. These Acts provide to such communities, through Aboriginal councils and land trusts, limited powers to deal in land. In general, amendments to these individual acts are intended to preserve these powers despite the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1988 and where applicable to provide that existing provision in these acts for the issue of licences for mining and exploration of minerals shall continue to apply regardless of anything contained in the Lands Acquisition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that certain authorities or instrumentalities should be able to operate in a totally commercial environment and so should not be bound by the requirement of the Commonwealth's general land acquisition legislation. Bodies such as the Defence Housing Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are examples of such organisations. Amendments to the enabling legislation of such organisations are being made to alter references to the 1955 Act to be references to the 1988 Act retaining that commercial independence. I would like honourable senators to note that such amendments proposed in this Bill only preserve existing powers and do not confer any additional legislative powers to the authorities involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual amendments to other Acts are varied in nature in terms of the result to be achieved. However, as I have noted earlier, these amendments do not introduce any new policy initiatives by government and are purely intended to preserve the `status quo' where the new Lands Acquisition Act 1988 might otherwise introduce change. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is complementary to, and is a necessary part of, the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 legislative package. Passage of this Bill will allow the new legislation to be implemented without undue delay. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the main purpose of this Bill is to permit faster migration clearance of overseas passengers at airports. It flows from the Government's Master Plan for Passenger Processing at Australia's airports. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's objective to provide visitors to Australia and Australian travellers fast and efficient service at our international airports. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in this Bill will provide that visas issued overseas will become an entry permit on entering Australia at an international airport; pre-cleared flights to operate to Australia; and safeguards of records and data bases which impact on immigration processing of passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the opportunity was taken to make some consequential amendments to the Migration Act flowing from the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Consequential Amendments) Act 1987. This amendment relates essentially to the redefinition of entry permit to clarify the status of statutory visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been concerned for some time to ensure that legislative and administrative requirements for entry to and departure from Australia keep pace with the demands of our burgeoning tourism industry. At the same time, we are concerned to maintain the necessary safeguards as to who enters Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has embarked on a comprehensive program of computerising many of the manual processes associated with visa issue and entry permit issue. The Department has also put in place systems whereby data obtained at visa issue is brought to Australia and used to facilitate entry processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The progressive computerisation of visa issue at major overseas posts in the past 18 months has enabled dramatic improvements to be made in the levels of service provided. Typically at our major tourist source posts we now offer an across the counter service where that is sought and a 24 hour service in all other cases. Computerisation has produced significant productivity gains and reduced demands for extra staff to meet the dramatic growth we have seen in tourism to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Officials in my Department have recently demonstrated the Australian visa system at the International Civil Aviation Authority Facilitation meeting in Montreal where the Australian visa format was adopted as the world standard. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, the Government has addressed the issue of movements of people through our international airports. That review jointly chaired by my department and the Australian Customs Service and involving all agencies associated with movements through our airports as well as representatives of the airlines and the tourism industry, culminated in endorsement by government of a Master Plan for passenger processing at Australian airports. My colleague, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business and I jointly gave some details of the Government's decisions on 8 September. </PARA>
<PARA> The Master Plan will result in a wide range of adjustments to processes and procedures applied by the range of agencies impacting on movements through airports. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as my portfolio is concerned we have sought to reduce the range of formalities associated with the entry/departure processes. We have sought to simplify decision processes without jeopardising the controls necessary in Australia's wider national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant step is to put in place a system, whereby a visa obtained for travel to Australia will, on entering Australia, unless cancelled operate as an entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements persons wishing to enter Australia must first obtain a visa. Upon arrival in Australia the holder of that visa may or may not be granted an entry permit pursuant to the provisions of the Migration Act. If granted an entry permit the person then enters Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements flowing from this Bill will provide for a system whereby a person will hold only one document which will serve a double purpose, that is, it will be a visa for the purpose of travel to Australia and an entry permit after entry to Australia at a proclaimed airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Act provides for entry permits to be in a form and specify conditions as determined by the Minister. No similar discretions exist in terms of the visa. The Bill seeks to inject the necessary discretion to enable the determination of visa conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a need to fix the date and place of entry into Australia. Such a provision is necessary from the viewpoint of both the holder of the visa and the department. For example as proof of entitlement to remain in Australia within the currency of the visa/entry permit or as proof of entry at a proclaimed airport. The Bill proposes the use of the current port and date stamp and departmental computer records as a prima facie evidence of arrival. </PARA>
<PARA> The present stand alone entry permits provisions will need to continue for several reasons: first, the new arrangements are only to operate in respect of entries at proclaimed airports which handle the bulk of travellers; secondly, to take account of persons who apply for change of status, that is permanent entry status after arrival as a temporary entrant. The third reason is that there will have to be transitional provisions to take account of the fact that not all persons travelling to, and entering Australia, will be holders of a visa in the new form. Additionally, present arrangements regarding fee collection for permit renewal and for issue of resident return visas will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of pre-clearance or the performance of immigration entry procedures offshore has been under consideration for some time. The concept involves the disembarkation of flights at other than international airports subject to satisfaction of health, quarantine and customs considerations. The concept provided for in the Bill is for individual designated flights flying non-stop from a place of departure to Australia. Passengers on these flights would be examined and immigration cleared for entry prior to departure for Australia. Upon disembarkation, they would enter Australia without further immigration formalities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to provide that a stamp in the form indicating the date, airport and country of departure for Australia will be placed in the passport of a traveller embarking on a pre-cleared flight. </PARA>
<PARA> If a pre-cleared flight lands at any other country prior to arrival in Australia the pre-clearance has no effect. Passengers would then be processed in the usual way. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments empower the Minister for Immigration to proclaim flights for the purposes of pre-clearance. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the pivotal role of electronic records and systems in my department's task in processing passengers, it is necessary to guarantee the integrity of such records and systems. This is essential in securing the general confidence in the new system. The Bill therefore provides that perusal of alteration of records and systems associated with passenger processing be limited to authorised officers in the performance of their duty and provides penalties for breach of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The further consequential amendments flowing from the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Consequential Amendments) Act 1987 seek to place a statutory visitor who might be granted an entry permit on a equal footing with other entry permit holders. The adjustments contained in the present Bill essentially correct oversights in the initial consequential legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the package of provisions in this Bill, as they relate to the important task of passenger processing at Australia's international airports, provides the legislative base for the progressive introduction of a system of passenger processing which is arguably the most advanced in the world. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make an amendment to the Naval Defence Act 1910 to enable persons employed at Garden Island Dockyard to be transferred to Australian Defence Industries Proprietary Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> I announced last August that the Office of Defence Production would be converted into a Government-owned company in March 1989 in order that the defence production establishments could become more commercially competitive. This step involves the transfer of 10 Defence Factories and Garden Island Dockyard to the newly established company, Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 2 years the Office of Defence Production, as part of an ongoing rationalisation of its operations, has reduced its work force by 25% while increasing productivity by 30%. This does not include the loss of employees resulting from the sale of Williamstown Dockyard and the conversion of the Government Aircraft Factories into a Company, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall aim has been to improve delivery and financial performance. It has been successful in saving the Defence budget, and ultimately the taxpayer, about $150 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's 1987 white paper on Defence emphasised the need for ODP to be as efficient as possible and set out the Government's objectives to use competition as a spur. Implicit in the white paper was the understanding that ODP would need to be structured in a way that would enable it to compete successfully for Defence and other work. The policy of progressively opening up more Defence work to competition means that more and more Defence Orders which once went to ODP will now be open to competitive bids from industry. Unless this organisation is able to adopt more commercial practices it will not survive this competition. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill inserts into the Naval Defence Act a provision to enable the blue collar employees at Garden Island Dockyard to be transferred to the new Company. The remaining employees of the Defence establishments are employed under the Supply and Development Act and the Public Service Act and will be transferred under similar provisions contained in these Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 2 years Garden Island Dockyard has undergone a major restructuring of its total work force, in line with industry generally. Improvements in efficiency and productivity were necessary if the Dockyard was going to be able to survive as a viable Government enterprise. The Dockyard has been operating on a full cost recovery basis for some time and considerable effort has been put into restructuring of awards. </PARA>
<PARA> It was thanks to the Dockyard that HMAS Cook was refitted in time for use by the Duke and Duchess of York in the Bicentennial Naval Salute in Sydney. This refit was brought forward for the occasion and was completed on time and on target. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My proposed amendment No. 4 in the schedule that is being distributed now seems to be unnecessary as the Government has indicated that it is prepared to move an amendment to clause 58 which would have much the same effect. After glancing at it I would prefer our drafting; nevertheless to accept it might make things easier at a later day. The Government provided in the Privacy Bill 1988 that in the event of the Privacy Commissioner including a determination under the terms of the Bill which includes a sum by way of compensation or for damage suffered by reason of an act or practice the subject of the complaint then an appeal would be open to the government agency, an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Of course, that may not be unreasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But it is surprising that the converse situation was not covered. If the commissioner refused to make such a determination there appeared in the Bill to be no opportunity for the complainant to appeal to the Tribunal. That seemed not only illogical but also somewhat unjust. The fact that the Government has been prepared to pick up this amendment that we are proposing and to move it would indicate that it is in agreement. I therefore will not move the fourth amendment that I proposed to move. I will rely on the Government's amendment, which no doubt Senator Tate will now move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a few points with regard to the amendment that the Government is to move. It allows for an application to be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for review of decision. I indicate that the Australian Democrats support this amendment. I indicated during the second reading debate that we would be supporting what was then a proposed Opposition amendment from Senator Hill to move for the capacity for an AAT appeal. I point out that, as usual with appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, there is a financial as well as a time cost involved. From recollection, an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal costs in the vicinity of $250, a cost which was applied and then increased with the support of the Opposition parties. It makes a mockery of their protests in recent days about the difficulty people have in using the freedom of information legislation and AAT appeals to get justice in this country. I guess that the time has long since passed when we can expect any sort of consistency from members of the Liberal and National parties on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have much preferred to have seen this amendment introduced by the Government contain an acknowledgment of the fact that some people will not be able to take advantage of the AAT's position and the fact that the legislation will now allow an appeal because people cannot afford the cost of it and, in acknowledging that fact, include a statement that fees will be waived for appellants under this legislation to the AAT. I would be interested in hearing the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, or for that matter the Opposition, justify having this sort of cost applied to an appeal to the AAT. Presumably, anybody who does appeal will have had to have expended a quite significant amount of money on freedom of information requests in the first place to find out just exactly what it is he or she has to appeal against, from where it emanated, how extensive the breach that has occurred is and the concern that he or she has. I would be delighted if the Minister could give an indication that the Government would take some steps to limit the financial burden on people who believe that they have a case, are taking it on appeal to the AAT and are likely to be very hard hit financially as a consequence. It is a travesty of justice if people feel that they have had a wrong committed against them and are unable to get satisfaction because they simply cannot afford to pay the costs involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government intends, by reason of the amendment which has been circulated only in the last few minutes, to acknowledge the validity in the argument that, where a complainant seeks a declaration that he or she is entitled to a specified amount by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered by reason of the act or practice the subject of complaint, there ought to be a capacity to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in order to seek, perhaps, a review, even of the quantum of the compensation that has been awarded. I do not think that that was included in the Opposition's original form of wording, but I think that we are all trying to achieve the same end, which is, as I say, that a complainant should be able to approach the AAT where the Privacy Commissioner has made a declaration but which may be inadequate as to quantum, according to the complainant, or even more so where the Commissioner has refused to include a declaration in relation to compensation or expenses in a determination which has been otherwise upheld.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment (5), which is included in the Opposition's series of amendments, provides for a civil action for breach of privacy by introducing a new clause 63a which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An interference with the privacy of an individual taking place after the commencement of this Act shall give rise to an action at the suit of the individual for breach of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed clause 63c states that the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory may, as a result of such an action, award damages; grant an injunction; order the defendant to deliver up to the plaintiff any document brought into existence in the course of the interference with the privacy of the plaintiff; or make any other order that to the court seems just. The purpose of the amendment is simply to add another weapon in the retinue of those who suffer breaches of this legislation at a cost to themselves-a cost to their personal privacy. We believe that, in actual fact, a civil action in particular might be the most effective deterrent on government agencies. It has been a remedy that has been considered in a number of inquiries in this field. In view of our belief that it is effective and, further, our belief that there is no reasonable objection that a government could bring to its inclusion, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Opposition's amendment because it is important that people have the capacity to take an action of this kind. However, I would point out that, yet again, it is an option that is open largely either to those people who are well enough off to be able to afford the legal fees or those who are so badly off that they qualify for legal aid. I suppose it is not quite as bad as the deal that the Opposition parties did with the Government regarding their so-called choice to quote the tax file number, where the penalty of 50.25c in the dollar from dollar one being extracted from income and refunded, where possible, at the end of the financial year, limits access to that so-called choice to people whose incomes are $150,000 or more a year, because for sure nobody on average weekly earnings or less will be able to afford to give up half of his or her income in order to take advantage of this so-called choice that the Opposition parties have written into the tax file number legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this particular event there is a wider group of people who will have some real choice, but I remind the Committee that, as with most legal actions, it is an after the event remedy. There has to be a breach before an action can be taken. While it could be argued that the presence of this clause in the legislation will restrain any hotheads any- where who are planning on leaking information that should not be leaked, it still remains a fact that before an action can be taken damage has to have been done. All the compensation in the world-assuming that the action is successful-will not recoup perhaps loss of reputation that has come from information that has been taken out of context or just maliciously inaccurately revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I would also argue that it was remiss of the Government that it did not include this sort of action in the legislation in the first place, since I would have thought that it was a fundamental right of every Australian to have recourse to the courts if he feels that he has been damaged in some way. For that reason we will be supporting the Opposition's amendment, although I repeat that I think it will be of benefit only to either the very well off or those who are very poorly off, as it comes after the event-as, of course, does a defamation action. This can be placed in the same category. The damage will have been done and may not be suitably recoverable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like at least to attempt to persuade the Opposition and the Australian Democrats not to pursue this amendment to a vote. For the ordinary Australian who suspects that a breach of the information privacy principles in relation to information held by Commonwealth agencies is about to occur, is occurring or has occurred, or in relation to misuse or abuse of tax file number (TFN) information, whether held by a Commonwealth agency or the private sector, we take the view that the best approach is to provide in the legislation an easily accessible method of getting that situation remedied. Quite frankly, for that reason-this relates to some of the points made by Senator Haines-surely it is less daunting for an individual in our society to be able to approach the Privacy Commissioner and seek, first of all, a clear understanding of what has actually gone on in a Commonwealth agency or in a private sector financial institution in terms of tax file number information. If, indeed, a breach of the privacy principles or the TFN guidelines is established, the situation can be remedied not only in relation to that individual but, of course, in relation to other individuals by ensuring that the practice or the series of acts that no doubt the agency, employer or financial institution would be engaged in are halted. Thereby, a remedy can be effectively obtained, as I say, not only in relation to the individual who first raises the matter, but also in relation to all other potential victims, if that is not too strong a term, of the breach of the privacy principles or TFN guidelines, as the case may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We think that will be a much more accessible and cheaper remedy for a person than actually having to face the daunting prospect of going to court and suing a person. As Senator Haines has said, suing an agency, an employer or a financial institution after the event is probably the least satisfactory course of action in relation to this whole area. Indeed, I think much of Senator Haines's concern could be somewhat ameliorated by giving a little more weight perhaps to clause 98 of the Bill which provides for injunctions. I think Senator Hill, too, would concede that there is an effective--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator Haines</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have to know something is coming before you can do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that Senator Haines said that there were occasions where one could not get any sort of remedy until after the event and that that was a very poor state of affairs. I am just indicating that where a person has engaged in, is engaging in or is proposing to engage in any conduct that constituted or would constitute a contravention of the Act, the Federal Court may, on the application of the Commissioner or any other person, grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the court's opinion it is desirable to do so, requiring the person to do any act or thing. So I think we have to give some weight to the fact that already within the Bill there is an attempt to provide through the injunction procedures in the Federal Court a more traditional, if you like, court-based method of trying to prevent the eruption within an agency of an undesirable practice, or certainly to prevent its continuance if indeed it is occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the structure of the Bill is actually based on a sound principle in that the ordinary person in our community can actually approach the Privacy Commissioner and get assistance and a remedy that includes compensation if, as we noted in the last series of amendments, there is a declaration following a determination that a breach of privacy has occurred. I think it is also important to allow this legislation to settle down a little and to see whether in fact the approach that the Government is suggesting is indeed the appropriate one. Certainly in the areas of sex discrimination and race discrimination it has been thought to be a useful way of dealing with these sorts of matters. I believe that we should allow for that more conciliatory, more helpful and, in the end, quite effective method of dealing with complaints about interference with privacy to have a fair run. Then we can examine whether in fact a court-based right to sue for damages might still be required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note what Mr N. A. Brown, the shadow Attorney-General, said in a press release on the Privacy Bill following acceptance at a joint meeting by the Liberal and National parties of the shadow ministry's recommendation that they accept the Privacy Bill as negotiated between Mr Brown and me. He put forward a proposition that a civil action for breach of privacy be included and, having given some arguments, concludes with this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> However, it must be conceded that, as this is new legislation, it should be given time to be accepted and understood before a decision is made on whether to allow a separate cause of action. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Mr Brown is indicating that whilst he thinks it is important to put forward the Opposition's concern that perhaps the structure of the Bill and its methodology might not turn out to be adequate, this concern should not be seen as so inherent as to require this matter to be pressed to an ultimate conclusion at this time. So, in short, I think the present structure of the Bill will be found to be adequate and we ought to at least allow it to operate for some time. Therefore, the Government opposes this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think essentially the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has shown that we need both injunctive relief and the capacity to take court action subsequently. To take out an injunction of the sort that the Minister has been talking about, a person has first of all to know that information has been leaked or is about to be leaked so that he can move to stop it being leaked, or to stop it being leaked any further. He also has to know, presumably, who is doing this in order to make it all stick. So there are a few imponderables.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that, I say to the Minister that I am delighted that the 1986 Bill has been improved to the extent that the Government has gone as far as putting this clause into the legislation. But, in as much as it is protection before the event, as distinct from during the event, one has to be a mind reader, I guess, a clairvoyant, or else have somebody leak information that somebody else is going to leak information, before one can take advantage of it. The Opposition's amendment picks up the problem after the event when perhaps taking out an injunction will not prove of any value at all because the damage has been done and some sort of compensation needs to be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is arguing that we ought to let this legislation ride as it is and see who and how many people get hurt before we make a move to provide the sort of relief that the Opposition's amendments propose. I really would not have expected to hear this from a man who I know is as committed to the principles of justice as anybody else is in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also briefly want to respond to the comments made by Senator Tate. The Minister made reference to my colleague, the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, who is shadow Attorney-General. I refer to another paragraph of that news release in which Mr Brown responded to the Government's indication that it would not support this proposed amendment which followed negotiation of a series of potential amendments between the Government and the Opposition. In that press release, Mr Brown stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A general right to sue for damages without proceeding through the Privacy Commissioner would, however, be a valuable addition and an additional inducement to agencies and the private sector to comply with the law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is basically our argument and it is the argument which I sought to put a few minutes ago. Mr Brown then added words to the effect that if support could not be obtained for this amendment, it might not be the end of the world because a remedy is provided under the proposed Act. That remedy has just been referred to by the Minister. However, I do not think there is any doubt that it was Neil Brown's preference that the additional remedy be included. We now have a situation where the Australian Democrats are prepared to support the argument for the inclusion of this additional remedy. On that basis we want to press it. I respectfully agree with many of the comments made by the Minister. It is unlikely that parties will take the alternative option of action in the civil courts. </PARA>

Nevertheless it is important that I say I am becoming concerned that costs are becoming a real disincentive to proceeding to the AAT but it is still a much cheaper jurisdiction than the civil courts. It therefore seems to me that this option will not often be utilised; nevertheless, it is an option. I can see no disadvantage to the Government in its being included. I really believe that it will prove to be probably the most effective incentive for those holding information to meet their statutory commitments and to avoid breaches under the Act. It is that deterrent aspect which I find the most persuasive argument for including the additional remedy. There is something about being taken to the civil courts in an action for damages that seemed to go beyond the administrative type remedy included in this Bill, even if it might not in practice amount to more money for damages. For those reasons we propose to press the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

During either the debate on the second reading motion or an earlier participation in the committee stage debate I pointed out that there is a serious problem with regard to the privacy of information contained within the private sector. During the second reading debate we heard all sorts of paranoid comments about the tax file number legislation and about what officers in the Australian Taxation Office were likely to do. The fact remains that ever since that agency has come into operation the privacy of the information contained within that section of the Department has been protected, and I think protected very well. The Australian Taxation Office has a good record of protecting the privacy of information. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not such a good record in the private sector. Newspaper reports from time to time indicate that, for malicious reasons or otherwise, people feed incorrect information into, say, credit reference bureaus so that somebody's credit rating is diminished and he or she perhaps cannot get a loan from somewhere else. The only case that has been brought to my attention about an agency that is in any way at all related to the Government is in a letter that appeared on my desk this morning in which a gentleman was protesting at the fact that Telecom Australia had issued a poor credit rating for this person because he had not paid a telephone bill which he had never received, of about $64. Telecom apparently takes the attitude that if people do not receive a telephone bill it is up to them to tell Telecom or they suddenly find that their credit rating is ripped out from underneath them. This man only discovered it when he went to his bank for a relatively small loan and was told that he could not have it because Telecom had placed his name on some list or another that circulates saying that he was not credit worthy. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time there are infringements of privacy in organisations associated with the Government but they are much more likely to come from the private sector. Even if they are not more likely, they are at least as likely to come from the private sector. The fact that the privacy is likely to be breached at all by the private sector should make us sufficiently concerned to insert the private sector under the interpretation section of this legislation, and specifically under the first definition of agency which appears in clause 6. At the moment the clause covers the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ``agency'' means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Minister;-</PARA>
<PARA>In some areas in this place some Ministers are agents for evil, I suspect. We now have them officially defined as an agency. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a Department;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a body (whether incorporated or not), or a tribunal, established or appointed for a public purpose by or under a Commonwealth enactment, not being:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an incorporated company, society or association;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) an organisation within the meaning of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 or a branch of such an organisation; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a body corporate constituted under subsection 6 (1) of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance 1970 of the Australian Capital Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>The clause then goes on to list a number of other people defined as agents including bodies established or appointed by the Governor-General or by a Minister; a person holding or performing the duties of an office established by or under, or an appointment made under, a Commonwealth enactment; a federal court, a court of the Australian Capital Territory; and the Australian Federal Police. It is quite appropriate, if we are envisaging that this range of people be picked up as agencies covered by the legislation, that we should also acknowledge the fact that the private sector needs to be picked up. After all, I remind the Parliament that it is the private sector in very large part that will be holding the information relating to the tax file number. The Privacy Bill before us is not standing on its own. Despite the fact that we need a Privacy Bill in any event, it is nevertheless here as an adjunct to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill. Whether or not it was part of a deal done between the Opposition and the Government is irrelevant. It is here as part of that tax file number legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind people who seem to have forgotten it that, unless people want to lose 50.25c in every dollar that they earn, their tax file number will be quoted to a range of private as well as public sector organisations-to banks, building societies, employers of one sort or another and other sources from which people earn income. If the private sector is involved in one half of this Bib and Bub set that we have in front of us, one would have thought that logic alone would require that the private sector be involved in the second part of it. If not, we would have a piece of legislation that protects some of the people some of the time but none of the people all of the time. That would be an exceedingly deficient piece of legislation. Even if the Privacy Bill were standing alone, one would have thought, in the interests of a broad sweep, that the Government would wish to pick up the private sector. It is at least as pervasive as the public sector, and probably has a worse record for release of information improperly and/or maliciously than the public sector has. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope it is not too much to expect the Opposition parties to return the courtesy of support for amendments which are essential. They will improve the legislation and, much more importantly, will provide some genuine protection of people's privacy across the board-not a ham-fisted, hard-hearted partial privacy protection hedged about with the capacity to seek injunctive relief, to take appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, or ultimately to take court action, but only against the public sector. Either we should do this as properly as we can or we might just as well not do it at all, given, as I said at the beginning, that the whole focus of the tax file number legislation is on the private sector. If the Government and the Opposition believe that it is appropriate to do some sort of deal over this with regard to privacy, they should make sure that that privacy legislation covers the areas that are covered by the other half of the deal. If the Government is not prepared to support the first and consequential amendments, I sincerely hope that the Opposition is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not prepared to accept the amendments. I think I need to make it absolutely clear, for those who may not have followed every element of Senator Haines's argument, that indeed the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill does bind the private sector, and does so in relation to both employers and financial institutions within the private sector. All the apparatus and all the arrangements under the Bill are available. No doubt the Privacy Commissioner will ensure that the guidelines as established by the Parliament in schedule 2, and then as substituted later on by him or her, as the case may be, will apply to the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a feature of some surprise to me in the last couple of weeks that the private sector has apparently accepted the guidelines set down in schedule 2 as appropriate, whereas previously the Government had envisaged that there would be a period of consultation between the Privacy Commissioner, aided by the consultative committee which would be established and be representative of users as well as those concerned with privacy issues, and the private sector. Even without that consultation, the Parliament has devised a series of guidelines which will, from the proclamation of this legislation, apply to the private sector. I am sure that will take some adjustment by the private sector right from day one. To add to that, the proposition that the private sector be bound by the information privacy principles (IPPs), which is what Senator Haines's proposition amounts to, would be to impose too much at this stage on the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is not to say that some of the arguments put forward by Senator Haines do not have some weight. Indeed, it will be known by honourable senators that the Privacy Commissioner has been given a specific function of encouraging corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information consistent with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA>to encourage corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information that are consistent with the Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;</PARA>
<PARA>It is in that process, and in the reporting by the Privacy Commissioner to the Parliament in his annual report, that the Parliament will then be best placed to make an assessment as to how the application of privacy principles to the full range of the private sector might take place within the constitutional limits of Commonwealth power. It is one thing to impose the information privacy principles on Commonwealth agencies, in relation to which we have full constitutional power and therefore responsibility and the operation of which we have a real understanding of. But if this Parliament were to impose information privacy principles immediately on the private sector within the constitutional limits indicated by the Australian Democrats' amendments, without the benefit of some experience of how in the various sectors of the private sector these principles might best be made to operate, we would probably create a regulatory regime which would not work and would not be satisfactory from the point of view of either those in the private sector who have such information or those within the community who fear that their privacy might be invaded by the misuse, abuse and wrongful disclosure of information held by private sector record keepers. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the guidelines proposed by the Parliament in relation to tax file number information will apply to employers and financial institutions to whom tax file number information can be properly disclosed. In relation to the information privacy principles, I believe that, with the assistance of the Privacy Commissioner and in the light of the reports of the Privacy Commissioner to the Parliament, the Parliament will be well placed to make an assessment of the extent to which further IPPs might be applied in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note what the Minister says, namely that clause 27 (1) gives the Privacy Commissioner a range of functions, including one to encourage corporations to develop programs, and clause 27 (2) goes on to say that `The Commissioner has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of his or her functions under subsection (1)'. What exactly does that mean? What powers does the Commissioner have? Who decides what is necessary? And, for heaven's sake, what does `convenient' mean? Does it mean if the Commissioner has time to do it, or if the company has time to do it, or if it suits the company to do it? Who defines what `necessary' is? Necessary to whom? Necessary to the company, to the individuals employed by the company, to the Commissioner, or to the Government-to whom? How long do we give a company to get its act together in this way? How do we make the company come to the decision that it needs to act in this way?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I doubt that there is a company in Australia that has even heard of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, much less has a copy of them. Is the Government going to provide every company in the private sector in Australia with a copy of the OECD guidelines, or somehow communicate to them that they have to get them? It is fine to say in a piece of legislation, `we are going to encourage people'. One can put down a plate of mashed pumpkin and peas in front of a three-year-old and stand to one side and say, `Darling, I am encouraging you to eat this'. As a mother, I can tell honourable senators that one will get a long way fast. What we have confronting us is the private sector privacy problem that equates to mashed pumpkin. If the Government does not give the private sector companies a reason for doing it, they are not going to do it. How are we going to get the Commissioner to impose on corporations these requirements to develop programs? What sorts of programs? What proof do we need that they are undertaking a program? How long do we give them to get that program under way? What sanctions are there if people say, `Bother you; we are not going to eat the pumpkin-we are not going to put into practice, or even develop, a program for protecting privacy or a program for handling records of personal information.'?</PARA>
<PARA> This has to be one of the most meaningless clauses of this legislation, because it does nothing. It says the Commissioner has, amongst a series of other functions, the power to encourage; and, furthermore, to give that encouragement in line with guidelines on the protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data issued by the OECD. I would be fascinated to hear from the Minister how this is going to be achieved. I know he has some extremely capable advisers sitting on his left, but I think this stretches even their capabilities. Could they please give me some idea of how the Commissioner is going to go about this encouragement, what he is going to do if nobody does anything about it, what help he is going to give corporations-if any-in doing something about it if they choose to do something about it, and how long we have to wait before the Government decides that simple encouragement is not going to work?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned court actions. He said maybe we should give other parts of the legislation a chance to work before we give people the option of taking things to court. It may be that before I came into this place I was a touch naive, but that was quickly knocked out of me. By and large, corporations do not do things unless they have to. That is why we have tax laws, and even then half the corporations in the country do not pay any tax because we also give them ways of wriggling out of it and then complain about the fact that our surplus is not high enough to help people in need. Is this going to be the same sort of thing? Are we going to write into the legislation that the Commissioner can encourage corporations to do things according to OECD guidelines and say, rather hopefully in the next subclause, that he has all the powers necessary or convenient-whatever that may mean-to encourage these programs, but not put any sting in the tail of it all? What is the point of it?</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: can the Minister tell me how the Commissioner goes about this? What happens when people do not get encouraged? What are `all things that are necessary' and, much more important, what are `all things that are convenient'? And, for whom? And how much of the Commissioner's time is going to be expended on encouraging private companies large and small to protect the personal information about people that is contained in their records?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the way, I am a bachelor. What I am trying to say is that I believe this legislation goes a long way to starting a process of bringing the private sector into line with the need to ensure that the privacy of individuals in relation to information that is required from them is properly safeguarded. I have indicated that that is certainly the case in relation to tax file number information. In relation to more general privacy matters, perhaps I should have emphasised that clause 27 (1) (n) gives the Commissioner the function of encouraging corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information and clause 27 (2) is the normal standard form of clause which, the functions having been outlined in clause 27 (1), confers on the Commissioner the power to undertake all those actions which are necessary or convenient in order to perform those functions. It is a perfectly straightforward and well understood form of conferring a power on a person who previously has been vested with certain functions and tasks to undertake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be of interest to remind honourable senators of a part of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report, Feasibility of a National ID Scheme: The Tax File Number. The Committee, of which Senator Hill I believe was a distinguished member, concluded at paragraph 7.27:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Committee recommends that the question of the possible regulation of the private sector by privacy legislation be referred to the privacy watchdog, which the Committee recommends be established, for investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the correct approach, as I have indicated, and I want to emphasise in relation to that particular function which is given to the privacy watchdog that under the clause which requires the Privacy Commissioner to report to the Parliament there is an express requirement-one of only two or three-that he report in relation to the operation of clause 27 (1) (n). I think it is quite significant that that has been highlighted in order to enable this Parliament to gauge whether clause 27 (1) (n) is working or whether it is as deficient in its effect as Senator Haines, who is full of foreboding in this matter, seems to think will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the fact that the Privacy Commissioner will be hereby empowered to devise strategies to encourage corporations to adhere to these principles-which, by the way, were devised by a committee chaired by Mr Justice Michael Kirby for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-will add to the effectiveness of the legislation in the sense that the private sector, which will be approached by the Privacy Commissioner, will know that the Parliament intends to take a particular interest in its voluntary adherence to these particular OECD principles, and it will be on notice that it is the Parliament's intention to put that particular function of the Privacy Commissioner under particular scrutiny. I believe that that is a sufficient position to have reached at this stage in the development of privacy legislation in Australia. For that reason, as I say, the Government will not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As much as I would like to repay Senator Haines's courtesy, the Opposition had to decide the question of this amendment on its merits. We will oppose the amendment. However, I hope that in a few moments I will have an opportunity to repay Senator Haines's courtesy in relation to some of her other amendments. After listening to Senator Tate, it seems that the Opposition, like the Government, has adopted a cautious approach in this matter. Obviously it is an issue that was debated within the Opposition, just as it was an issue which was debated within the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as was just mentioned by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). The Opposition reached the same conclusion as that Senate Committee did, which is basically that it would be a mistake to rush into attempting to effectively bind the private sector in relation to these privacy principles and that rather a step-by-step approach should be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that, principally, we also adopted the same type of arguments that were mentioned by the Senate Committee, such as concerns about a cost-benefit analysis. As far as we could determine, there has been no real analysis of the cost to the private sector of this exercise. Nor has there been an assessment to weigh those costs against potential benefits. We were also concerned about the constitutionality of the proposal. I note that Senator Haines has made efforts to ensure that her amendment falls within the constitutional capacity of the Commonwealth which, of course, means that partnerships are not included, sole traders are not included, and presumably--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are stuck with the Constitution, Senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, from time to time, I have supported amendments to the Constitution, but they do not get passed very often. This really means that a two-tiered approach is needed to effectively bind the private sector: the Commonwealth passes legislation within its constitutional capacity and the States pick up what is left. Of course, that concern was raised by the Australian Law Reform Commission when it prepared its report on privacy. The Commission recommended that the private sector should relate to only the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and external Territories. As I have just indicated, Senator Haines has gone one step further than that. Nevertheless, I am sure that she would not claim that her amendment covers the field. So that is a further reason we think the matter should be further considered. We believe that, although there is a great deal of personal information held within the private sector, the level is nothing like that which is held by the public sector, and that factor came out during the considerations of the Senate Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fair to say that we were all stunned not only at the volume of personal information held by government but also at the ease with which it is transferred from department to department and from agency to agency. Therefore, as a committee that represented all parties in this chamber, we believed that the real goal, at least in the first instance, would be to put down a Bill that would bind the public sector and, therefore, the private sector could be looked at at a later date. I guess we also took into account the additional argument that much of this information is gained under compulsory powers in the public sector. This is not the case in the private sector, although if one does not supply financial information one does not receive, say, a bank loan. Therefore, effectively, although the situation might not be very different, technically much of the private sector information is gained at the peril of committing an offence and suffering a penalty if the information is not provided. So it seemed to us that there was a greater obligation to use care in relation to that information and therefore-in a cautious step-by-step approach-the first target had to be the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not ruling out for ever an extension into the private sector. We believe it is a matter that should be reviewed in due course. We note the recommendation of the Senate Committee, that is, that the new privacy watchdog-the Privacy Commissioner in this instance-should give consideration to private sector provisions. We think that would be a worthwhile exercise in due course. If we had more basic information upon which to make a cost-benefit analysis in the future, perhaps we could be more confident in determining a position on the private sector in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I agree with the argument of Senator Haines in relation to clause 27 (1) (n). I know that it was raised by the Minister, I guess not as an alternative but nevertheless in an attempt to indicate that some effort has been made in relation to the private sector. I would not place any great faith in that provision advancing the issue any further whatsoever. It seems to me that it is one of those additional `sound good' provisions that are added to a clause, that do not primarily relate to the principal function of the legislation but which, nevertheless, are useful in that Ministers can refer to them in debates such as this. I do not think such a provision will advance us much further in this instance. As I have said, the Opposition decided, obviously after considerable debate, to adopt a more cautious approach in relation to the private sector and, therefore, as I have indicated, we will not support the Democrat amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed but not surprised at Senator Hill's approach. Unlike him, I think it is better that we go part of the way down the track rather than not go any of the way at all. Simply because we cannot reach the end of the exercise is no real justification for not picking up part of the problem. I acknowledge the fact that the Constitution, inasmuch as it restricts Federal Government jurisdiction, does impede this Parliament from covering such groups as partnerships. However, that is no reason for not covering private sector groups such as incorporated companies and so on which are within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. We do not make other decisions with regard to legislation in this place because only those groups in the community that the Federal heads of power are able to deal with are picked up. We did not not proceed with sex discrimination legislation, for example, because it covered only those public and private organisations that the Federal Government had some jurisdiction over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill argues, apparently, that, while there is some intrinsic merit in our amendment to include the private sector in the purview of this legislation, the Liberal Party will not support the amendment, for what I gather are three reasons: first, that it does not go far enough; secondly, the time is not right; and, thirdly, it will be costly to the private sector to pick up. If we stopped passing legislation in this place simply because there was some cost to the organisations to which the legislation applied, we would never get through anything here. Of course, there will be costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations protecting consumers or small businesses from predatory big businesses involve cost. All sorts of measures that we take in this place impose some costs on organisations. The collection of payroll tax, or even ordinary taxes, imposes costs on organisations. They habitually use it as a tax deduction; so the taxpayer ends up funding at least half of it. Therefore, I do not think it is a justification to argue that we cannot include the private sector because costs might be involved. We all know what happens when there is some sort of cost involved in an organisation complying with government legislation and regulations-it passes that on to the consumer. Let us not assume that these organisations are altruistic, because they are not. In the long run the cost will be borne by the people of Australia. However, I would have thought that the protection of privacy is something that people would regard as being important enough for them to be prepared to to bear a limited cost. </PARA>
<PARA> With due respect, the Minister did not satisfactorily answer the concerns that I have about clause 27 (1) (n) or, indeed, clause 27 (2). The Minister said-and I think I am quoting him correctly-that there is a requirement for the Commissioner to make a report to the Parliament about how he, or she, is going with regard to the implementation of clause 27 (1) (n). I do not know what that report has to contain. The Commissioner could simply say, `I haven't done anything yet, folks, sorry', or, `I tried but it didn't work,' or, `I have had some success in this area but not much success elsewhere'. Will there be a requirement to name organisations that are refusing to be encouraged, or will we simply name those which have been encouraged? It does not seem much, then, to say that the Commissioner is going to report to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that he believes that this report process goes a long way towards starting the process of including the private sector in the purview of this legislation. I shall leave aside the mashed pumpkin, Minister, and I will give another little homely example: if one wants to go to the shops, and it is too far away to walk or one does not feel inclined so to do, one may well decide to drive. However, although getting into the car goes a long way towards starting the process, unless one goes further than that and actually puts the key into the ignition, turns it, revs the engine, and goes through all the other procedures that have to be gone through, one has not gone anywhere at all. While getting into a car might go a long way towards starting the process of travelling somewhere, in itself it achieves nothing. I would think that the Commissioner presenting a report to the Parliament indicating what people have or have not been encouraged to do is much the same as simply getting into a car preparatory to going somewhere: without other action it does not achieve a thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I ask the Minister whether he can give some indication of what procedures the Commissioner will actually undertake in order to encourage corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information. Furthermore, how will they be encouraged to do that in a manner that is consistent with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am terribly disappointed that Senator Aulich voted against my amendments, since it was he, during the second reading debate, who expressed concern that the largest numbers of privacy breaches were indeed in the private sector. He expressed concern that the Australian Democrats had not done anything about the private sector prior to that. Senator Aulich had obviously failed to notice that for several years there had in fact been on the Notice Paper a private member's Bill from the Australian Democrats to introduce privacy provisions that covered the private sector as well as the public sector. So I suggest that the next time Senator Aulich hears the division bells ringing, he asks somebody what it is all about before he chooses which side to sit on, and does not make himself look sillier than he needs to by voting against the very proposal that he spoke in favour of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So Senator Aulich was persuaded, if one believes the Minister, by his rhetoric that indeed the private sector does not need to be covered right now and that we can leave it to the Privacy Commissioner to give some encouragement. I want to raise a couple of questions with the Minister and/or his advisers with regard to some other definitions in clause 6. The definition of `personal information' on page 5 of the legislation reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ``personal information'' means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion;</PARA>
<PARA>I might be wrong-I hesitate to say that I frequently am, although I suspect that several others will offer that suggestion-but it does seem that that definition is deficient. Does it, for example, include unique identifiers other than names? It says, `an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'. Is that only somebody's name? Is there some number that is an identifier? Is there some symbol or code that is an identifier? Does the definition of `personal information' include information which is computer-linked to the personal information base as distinct from personal information forming part of a data base? I am simply not clear about what this definition of `personal information' actually is; how it is linked to what; who determines whether the identity is apparent or not; what `reasonably be ascertained' means; and whose information or, worse, whose opinion, is being taken into account here. I would like the Minister to give the Parliament, I hope for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, some better idea of what `personal information' really means, as distinct from what it says it sort of means in the definition on page 5 of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With due respect, I think Senator Haines is being unduly filled with foreboding by what is really an attempt in this particular definition to take account of the fact that personal information about an individual can cover such a wide range of matters that it has been necessary to cast the definition in a way which does not allow an argument to be raised to the effect that the information that is held is really not personal information because it does not name a person or perhaps have a unique identifier, or something like that. What this particular definition section is trying to do is to indicate that personal information means information or an opinion, whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. Therefore, it is really looking to link an individual and a certain type or quantum of information held by an agency or employer, or by a financial institution in the case of tax file numbers, in a commonsense way because the information is of such a character that it points in the direction of a particular person and enables one to single out a particular person from the crowd and to say, `Yes, this information relates to that particular individual'. It does not require names or unique identifiers or symbols or numbers, although, of course, in a situation in which a name is linked with the information the matter is more or less resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This definition is cast in these terms in order to include all those situations in which the information is sufficiently precise to point in the direction of a particular individual. That link between the identity of the person and the information can be made in such a myriad of ways that to be absolutely honest I really do not see the difficulty that Senator Haines is pointing to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to the Minister, I wonder what the point is of having personal information when one does not know who the person is on whom one has the information. I want to know too whose decision it is that the identity is apparent, where the information comes from, what opinions are taken into account, and what is to be done with the information. If we do not know who the person is-that is the example the Minister gave-about whom the information is retained, what it the point of retaining the information? More importantly, what happens if there are several people with the same or similar identifiers and there is information on all or any of them? It bothers me that there are plenty of people in Australia on whom information is collected who have similar names. Such people might even have the same address. It is not unusual for a man, men being what they are and wishing their dynasties to continue, to call his eldest son by the same name. That son may reside at the same address well into his income earning years. The personal information that is collected about Tom Brown ought to be more readily contained within the box, the database or whatever, that that person's information is collected in, than seems to be the case in this legislation. Are we saying that we identify people by guesswork and if there are several John Browns at the same address about whom information is held, somebody forms the opinion about the ownership, if you like, of that information secure in the knowledge that it does not matter whether the information is true or not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot understand the purpose of framing the definition of `personal information' in this way. Under this guise, it could apply to practically anybody. It does not need to be true. One could guess who might own it. Nobody seems to be at all accountable here. I am absolutely at a loss to work out what this definition is all about and how the Government thinks that it will avoid any misuse of any personal information since it does not seem to me that we can define `personal information' very accurately, at least in these terms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that one really has to go to clause 13 of the Bill and the information privacy principles contained within clause 14 of the Bill. These clauses form the real core of this legislation which is to indicate, in this case to Commonwealth government agencies, the `Manner and purpose of collection of personal information'; `Solici- tation of personal information from individuals concerned'; `Solicitation of personal information generally'; `Storage and security of personal information'; `Information relating to records kept by record-keeper'; `Access to records containing personal information'; `Alteration of records containing personal information'; `Record-keeper to check accuracy etc. of personal information before use'; `Personal information to be used only for relevant purposes'; `Limits on use of personal information'; and `Limits on disclosure of personal information'. As I say, clause 13 indicates:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . an act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual, if, and only if, the act or practice-</PARA>
<PARA>in the case of the information privacy principles (IPPs)-</PARA>
<PARA>breaches an Information Privacy Principle in relation to personal information that relates to the individual;</PARA>
<PARA>What this Bill attempts to do is to provide a regime or a structure within which the personal information relating to individuals can be safeguarded. Clearly, in that situation one needs to be very clear as to the meaning of `personal information'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator Haines</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not; that is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When one puts it in that context and sees the way in which it is meant to operate then `personal information', having that sort of broad definition which Senator Haines has indicated, is meant to be as comprehensive as possible of all the situations in which a government agency is likely to have a piece of information which, if improperly disclosed, could do some sort of damage, or certainly infringe the privacy of a particular person within our community. It may be that the information held by the agency does not have a label attached with the words `John Brown' or `John Brown of XY Street, Z suburb, in the city of A, in the State of B'. It may nevertheless be quite apparent from the sort of information in that particular database or record to whom that information relates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that situation, which is not a labelled situation but which sufficiently points to an individual, that individual ought to have the right to go to the Privacy Commissioner and say, `This Commonwealth agency is breaching information privacy principle, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 and will you aid me in remedying the situation?'. It is cast in those terms in order not to allow an agency to escape from the obligations of adhering to the information privacy principles by the agency saying that personal information has to be very narrowly defined. It is defined in a very comprehensive and broad way in this definition clause in order to ensure that, however information and identity of an individual in Australia is linked, the person who is pointed to has the benefit of the protection of the information privacy principles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer, as far as it goes. I think I understood him to say that if personal information about an individual is leaked that person has an action he or she can take, under clause 13 of the Privacy Bill, before the Privacy Commissioner. Clause 13 says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the purposes of this Act, an act or practice is an interference of the privacy of an individual if, and only if, the act or practice . . . breaches an Information Privacy Principle in relation to personal information that relates to the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>What happens if the personal information does not relate to that individual but is alleged to relate to that individual? We are talking about a definition that includes the word `opinion'. It includes the words `whether true or not'. What happens if there is a confusion of identities and it is alleged that personal information that relates to an individual on file relates to a specific individual but not the particular individual to whom it is attached in the file? Is there an action that can be taken? It certainly does not appear to be the case under clause 13. </PARA>
<PARA> Somebody may leak information, for example, that a Mary Smith who lives at a particular address had an abortion and because that person knows that that woman is Catholic or a member of a right to life organisation that person uses it against her. In fact, it may not be that particular Mary Smith at all but a Mary Smith who lives at that same street name and number in a different city or at that same street name and number in a different suburb. Where is the interference with privacy if personal information that is contained on an individual is leaked as if it were personal information about another individual?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The structure of the Bill provides that in the normal situation under clause 36 (1):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An individual may complain to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice that may interfere with the privacy of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Haines asks, `Well, what if an act or practice which indeed amounts to an interference with the privacy of an individual is nevertheless not properly the subject of a complaint by the individual concerned because of a mixture of identities or some such thing?'. It might be worth looking at clause 27 (1) (a), combined with the very powerful clause 27 (2), which allows the Commissioner to do all things that are necessary or convenient to carry out his or her functions. Clause 27 (1) (a) says that the Commissioner, in effect, can:</PARA>
<PARA>investigate an act or practice of an agency that may breach an Information Privacy Principle and, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so, to endeavour, by conciliation, to effect a settlement of the matters that gave rise to the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that would enable the Privacy Commissioner to undertake an investigation of an act or practice without the need for it to be triggered by a particular complainant correctly identifying herself as the victim of an improper disclosure of information held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(South Australia-Leader of the Australian Democrats) (6.16)-I thank the Minister. I am not 100 per cent convinced but I guess that I never will be. I want to move on to the definition of `tax file number information'. On page 6 of the Bill it is defined as meaning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>information (including information forming part of a database), whether compiled lawfully or unlawfully, and whether recorded in a material form or not, that records the tax file number of a person in a manner connecting it with the person's identity. </PARA>
<PARA>It worries me that we are acknowledging that information is or may be collected unlawfully and put on some form of database. In any event, as it stands, the definition of `tax file number information' seems to mean information that records the tax file number of a person in a way connecting it with the person's identity. This necessarily excludes information which is associated with the tax file number-or tax file numbers, because with business and corporation structures people are legitimately likely to have more than one-recorded in a way which is not connected with a person's identity but which can be linked to a person's identity via other information in the record. Either way, it seems that the original record does not constitute tax file number information. The Bill does not control its collection, storage, use and security. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the security of the information which lawfully or unlawfully may be collected. Let me tell honourable senators why. Quite recently I had a complaint from a constituent drawn to my attention. The constituent placed an advertisement for a room to let in her house for the period of the Grand Prix in Adelaide. She received a long phone call from a person claiming to be a Canberra public servant. That phone call included questions about her attitude to homosexuality; in other words, presumably whether she would mind if the person renting the house were a homosexual. Some time later she received a letter written on the letterhead of a Queanbeyan hotel, but posted in Canberra, from this apparent public servant, who identified himself only by his first name. The letter contained reference to her Department of Social Security (DSS) benefit number and her account number with the State Bank of South Australia. The constituent, I might add, did not give the person who phoned, claiming to be a Canberra public servant, her address. She has a silent phone number. Her phone number, name and address are not linked in any public document such as the phone book. The phone number was in the advertisement, but that did not in any way provide the additional information. She had given him her name, obviously, when he rang up. So the two pieces of information that he had at the end of the phone call were her phone number and her name. Presumably, if he knew the prefix of the phone number and assumed that it was not a business number, the use of the electoral roll would have been sufficient to get that information. The public servant went on to say that soon he would be going on 12 months leave, that he was a professional gambler and that he was looking for somewhere close to the Adelaide casino to stay for the period of that leave. Remarks contained in the letter were to the effect, `If you don't tell Big Brother, neither will I'. Perhaps the Minister can confirm this most extraordinary situation. I have the name of the woman concerned and her phone number. I would be delighted if somebody took up this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is fine. I would be happy if the Australian Federal Police (AFP) picked it up. I have received this information only today and I have not had an opportunity to pass it on to the AFP. If the Minister wishes to do so in his capacity, I will pass on the relevant details to him. The point I am trying to make is that we are dealing with a lot of additional information in this legislation that is supposed to be protected by the privacy legislation but which may well not be. While there are legal avenues open to people after the event, or before it if one is clairvoyant or gets a tip-off, the security of information is not necessarily assured. Here is a case where a silent phone number is involved and still somebody was apparently in a position to trace enough information to come up with this woman's social security benefit number and, of all things, her account number with the State Bank, presumably because that is on the DSS form for purposes of assessing other income for means test use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like the Minister to give us some assurances that there will be sufficient security of information contained under the definition `tax file number information' and all the clauses of the legislation that relate to that to prevent this sort of thing happening. Clearly, it can happen. We know that it can happen. Earlier I said that Telecom Australia had gone out of its way to discredit the credit rating of an individual who unknowingly owed Telecom money. It is all very well to say that at the moment we do not have privacy legislation in place and that apparently there is no immediate recourse to justice, much less compensation, for the two cases that I have mentioned. But I am not at all satisfied, and neither should those who are likely to vote on this issue be satisfied, that any information-however we define it and however we attach it to other people-is secure. </PARA>

<PARA> In relation to tax file number information, this Parliament, in passing this Bill-if it chooses so to legislate-is trying to achieve, as far as possible, the sorts of safeguards that have been spoken of by including, in schedule 2, the guidelines which were not in the Bill as originally introduced. Clearly, the Government's first preferred position was to leave the matter rather bare, allowing the Privacy Commissioner, after consultation with the public and private sectors-using the consultative committee as much as possible-to devise guidelines in relation to the security, collection, storage and use of tax file number information. That was not satisfactory. We have tried to go a step further by the Parliament itself setting down interim guidelines concerning the proper protection of tax file number information. I believe that those guidelines, whilst in somewhat general terms, do indicate the important steps in achieving that safeguarding of tax file number information. I believe that in setting them down, the Parliament has gone a long way to indicating the manner in which it believes the general principle of the legislation ought to be achieved in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines, which are subject to improvement and modification and will be brought back to the Parliament, and particularly this chamber, and the Privacy Commissioner's second thoughts, if you like, on those guidelines, will come into operation only if this chamber decides they should. They may either supplement or displace the interim guidelines in schedule 2. I believe that we have a structure which indicates, at least in the beginning, how tax file number information might be better protected. It is certainly an improvement on the original Bill and helps to allay at least some of the fears that can be aroused when one looks at a bare section of an Act without the benefit of this fleshing out of the guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was discussing schedule 2 in relation to the definition of `tax file number information' in clause 6 of the Bill before us. I had raised some concerns about the security of that information, citing a particularly unfortunate example that had been drawn to the attention of my office whereby an alleged Commonwealth public servant had been able to match information on a woman from her name and her unlisted telephone number. The Minister drew my attention to schedule 2, the interim guidelines concerning the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information. I have to say that this does not allay my concerns in any real sense because all the way through this schedule the phrase `all reasonable steps' is used. Unless I have missed something, `all reasonable steps' as a term is not defined and I would like to know exactly what the Government, the drafter, or whoever believes the term `all reasonable steps' means. In schedule 2, paragraph 2.2 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients collecting tax file number information shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that the manner of collection takes account of the rights of persons to control the accumulation and dissemination of information relating to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I am not exactly sure what `the rights of persons' as a phrase is defined as, nor how people are in a position to control the accumulation, much less the dissemination of information relating to themselves. Given the problems that I raised earlier about the definition of `personal information' itself, I wonder exactly what the term `information relating to themselves' means. How secure is this information made by a schedule which uses such questionable terms as `all reasonable steps'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the guidelines which are set out in Schedule 2 have to be seen as supplementary to the very stringent sanctions outlined in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill. Indeed, the Bills have been debated cognately for that very reason. In the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill it is very clearly set out, for example, that a person shall not divulge or communicate another person's tax file number to a third person other than in the lawfully prescribed way set out in the Bill. We have there, obviously, as is proper for this very important safeguarding of tax file number matters, a criminal law regime. A penalty of $10,000 or imprisonment for two years, or both, is a sanction applied to breach of the relevant clauses in the legislation, such that a very precise obligation is laid on a person in relation to safeguarding tax file number information in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Schedule 2 of the Privacy Bill provides for a fleshing out of the prudent steps which ought to be taken by a government agency, an employer or a financial institution in the private sector as further safeguards to the tax file number information, and quite practical guidelines for its storage, security, protection and so on. The Parliament will be without the benefit of the normal consultation process between the Privacy Commissioner and the advisory committee that is outlined in the Bill to aid his deliberations. Nevertheless, the steps are set down and the phrase `all reasonable steps', which occurs from time to time, is, I believe, a very sensible recognition of the fact that, unlike in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill, in this situation what we require of employers and financial institutions in the private sector is a reasonable regime of further safeguards, protections and precautions-prudent practices that they might undertake in order to safeguard the tax file number information. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Privacy Commissioner and the rest of the community become more used to the problems that might be thrown up in the proper storage, security and disclosure of tax file number information, the refinements and the more precise wording that Senator Haines is perhaps looking for at this stage will probably come in the second round, which will supplement, amend or displace these interim guidelines. But I think it is quite sensible that at the moment the sort of language used in the guidelines be adopted. It is not meant at all to provide for a loose regime, but it is meant to indicate that, because we are trying to cover such a wide body of tax file number recipients, precise guidelines as to every situation cannot possibly be formulated. Therefore, the flexibility inherent in the term `all reasonable steps' I think is warranted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am starting to feel a touch dizzy because it seems to me that what has happened with the Minister's answer is that we have now come full circle to the original question I asked about the definitions; that is, the meaning of the term `personal information'. The Minister has just gone to the other Bill that was a part of the cognate debate; namely, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill, and said that the specifics with regard to security of the information and the penalties attached are contained within that Bill. I accept that, but again we then get to the question: how do we trace the source of the leak? Personal information of the sort defined on page 5 of the Privacy Bill is defined as all sorts of information or opinion, whether true or not, that is contained in records or recorded in some form. `Record' is defined as `a document, a database, however, kept, or a photograph or other pictorial representation of a person'. How detailed is that database? How accessible is it and to whom is it accessible?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well to say that the tax file number legislation provides security steps and penalties, and that schedule 2 of the Privacy Bill supplements those but we come back to the situation of finding out how, in Heaven's name, anybody traces a leak of personal information when it is defined as broadly as this and contained in so many places. As Senator Hill said to me earlier this evening before the dinner break, there might be a chance of finding the person who got hold of the personal information about a Department of Social Security (DSS) number of my constituent whose case I raised earlier. Presumably, only DSS has that information. But if I read the term `personal information' correctly and follow that up with a reference to the definition of the term `record' which is referred to in the definition of `personal information', I presume that those databases are not discreet or discrete-both words apply-and that we do not have department specific records. We have one shared database and if somebody's DSS number is revealed one of a hundred or more persons could be responsible for that. It is a bit cloud-cuckoo-land to write into legislation steps to ensure security, penalties and sanctions to follow a breach in security, to have a piece of privacy legislation attached to the Bill that could cause the problems in the first place, to have that privacy legislation not cover the private sector, and to make the whole thing so circular that it is impossible to protect any information on anybody from anyone else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines has really just rehearsed almost all of the arguments which lead her to find inadequacies in the privacy legislation and, indeed, in the tax file number legislation. She obviously raises a difficult problem for investigators when there is a leak, particularly of the kind brought to the attention of the chamber before dinner. But that is no different from the task that faces investigators and the Australian Federal Police from time to time in trying, as best they might, to go to the source to try to locate the person who is responsible for an abuse of information which ought to be held and used only for the purpose for which it was gathered. That is only a very typical problem which faces any investigation of such a leak of material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that the privacy legislation in itself can overcome those difficulties of locating the person responsible for misuse of information held, except in so far as the Privacy Commissioner has an ability to have access to all records held in the agencies concerned. Indeed, if he has reason to believe that a person has information or a document relevant to the investigation, he can give to the person a written notice requiring that person to give information, produce documents and so on. No doubt that would be part of the process by which the investigation would be conducted. I believe that the sorts of processes set out in the Bill which vest very considerable power and oversight in the Privacy Commissioner will be an additional means for attempting to locate the sorts of leaks which Senator Haines speaks about. But in general, the matter that she has raised is no different from the difficulty of pursuing a leak from within government agencies at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have to pursue this point because the Minister has missed the very issue that I raised; that is, there is a difference here in what has been the norm to date. As I understand it, at the moment the Department of Social Security (DSS) contains within its database information on social security recipients. This information is not in some other department's database. The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but most people around here assume that there is no sharing of that information. I can find no definition in either the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill or the Privacy Bill of the database that we are referring to in the definition of `record' which is used throughout this legislation. Who has access to this database? Is it a single database? Does the Department of Social Security have its database, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have its, and other organisations have their own? Is the information contained in the DSS database also contained on the Australian Taxation Office database?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the answer to that is yes, we have a very different problem from the one we currently face. If information on people's tax returns is leaked from the ATO then there is a chance that we can pinpoint the area. We have a chance of finding out which office, and what part of the office, has dealt with that person's tax return. If information regarding somebody's social security pension is made available, presumably we can go through the same process. While it might be difficult for the Australian Federal Police or the State police forces, they at least have a starting point. If my suspicion is correct and this database contains information from more than one department or section, we no longer have a reasonably sized finite group of potential culprits in the event of a leak; we have an almost infinite bank of potential culprits. That is vastly different from the position we currently have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just saying this because Senator Haines asked what the database is. There is no phrase within the definition of `personal information' or `record' which speaks of `the database'. There is no such sort of composite entity in existence. In the two definitions, one of personal information and the other of record, we are trying to say that we have to recognise that the computer age is with us and that to refer to documents would be too narrow a way to talk about those methods of recording personal information available within bureaucracies, whether they be in the private or public sector. Therefore the definition speaks of information which can form part of a database, and the definition speaks of record. It speaks of a document or a database, however kept. I think that is a simple recognition of the fact that information can be recorded and stored and retrieval can occur from an entity and there does not have to be any written documentation in the traditional filing sense that is the basis of the method of holding that particular information. That is all those references to databases are meant to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to particular agencies, one would have to go through the various secrecy provisions which protect the information in relation to their holdings, whether they are held in documentary form or in a database within the agency. Those secrecy provisions-for example, in relation to the Australian Taxation Office-are well known to honourable senators and are part of the way in which that information is, one hopes, held secure. So that is the situation. It is merely a description attempted in these definitions of the way in which this information can be held within the private sector or within the Commonwealth agencies concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no common database for the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office. I ought to make that clear straight away. As Senator Haines would know, there is provision in the information privacy principles (IPPs)-and she will come to them, no doubt; IPPs 10 and 11-which indicates that there can be a transfer of information in situations where, according to principle 11 (1) (e), `the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue'. As honourable senators will know, that particular provision cannot override explicit secrecy provisions contained in legislation. It has to be seen in that context as not overriding or displacing those particular secrecy provisions. But there is there a recognition that we hope the Parliament will accept that there are situations where disclosure of personal information by one agency to another for those purposes could be required. In that situation the exception outlined in principle 11-I think we will probably come to a full debate on it-indicates that all personal information is not to be held so sacrosanct to the agency to which it was first provided that other major matters of public interest or other major matters of concern such as the protection of the public revenue or the enforcement of the criminal law cannot themselves be advanced.</PARA></TALK.START>

Clause 7 (1) (a) (iv) excludes the National Crime Authority (NCA) from the Bill. I would like the Minister to say why. The exemptions in the IPPs in the Bill, as the Minister would know, already protect the National Crime Authority in its information gathering activities, and its databases are protected from access and correction by the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, I remind the Minister, in case he needs reminding, that the NCA has its own secrecy clause. Given all of that, it does seem somewhat inappropriate that the Privacy Commissioner should not be able to audit the information collecting, recording and disclosure practices of the NCA around those other criteria that operate to protect it. I would be interested to know why the Government felt compelled to add a further exclusion relating to the NCA in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable senators will know that the National Crime Authority (NCA) holds a unique status. It is true that it is, at least in part, a creature of this Parliament, but of course it also has legislative underpinning from all the State parliaments and the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory. I think it is the only national law enforcement institution which is founded on and sustained by legislation of all the various parliaments around the Commonwealth. That gives it a certain special status, which is not the case with other Commonwealth agencies. It is also the case obviously that it is vested by this Parliament with extraordinary powers that are not available to other law enforcement agencies. Because of that, the type of surveillance that it is put under to keep it operating within proper democratic bounds is set down in the statute and includes the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority which provides a means and a process by which any abuse of the powers which it has can be exposed to democratically elected representatives. It is within that sort of framework that the overall supervision and curtailing, ensuring that the NCA acts in a proper manner in the exercise of its power, is to take place. That is the scheme which the Parliament at the moment considers sufficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we had a report from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority which indicated that that Authority might be brought within the purview of this sort of legislation, that might give material which would require a response and reflection and deliberation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that answer. I would appreciate it if he could refer that very question to the joint parliamentary committee concerned. Can we now look at the information privacy principles in clause 14? I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 2. Page 11, clause 14, Information Privacy Principles, Principle 2, lines 37 and 38, leave out `the individual concerned is generally aware of', insert `the individual concerned is informed, in writing, of'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an amendment to information privacy principle (IPP) 2 which relates to the solicitation of personal information from an individual; that is, it relates to someone in officialdom requesting personal information from a particular individual. As it stands, IPP 2 requires those collectors of information to make the people quaintly known as information subjects `generally aware' of the purpose of the collection of the information. `Generally aware' is not satisfactory, as it can mean all sorts of things. One could simply say, `We need this information'. Since people tend to be intimidated by government officials, simply being told vaguely that the information is required may well lead them to provide the information without seeking anything more specific. Indeed, it may well be that the person collecting the information may simply believe that the argument that the Government needs the information is quite sufficient. I do not happen to believe that, and I hope that the majority of the Committee supports my feelings in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is quite unacceptable that such a general term as `generally aware' is in this legislation. I think it is unacceptable that people from whom information is to be gathered should be told in such a vague way, or be put in a position where they may be told in a very vague way, why the information is being gathered. If we are to go through this exercise-and thanks to the collusion of the Opposition we are-at the very least we should be giving the people from whom information is collected as much information in return about why it is being collected. They should be told in quite specific terms the purpose of the collection. I hasten to point out to the Minister that this is not some nuisance amendment that I have dreamed up in order to take up the time of the chamber, and Senator Hill can look as disbelieving as he likes about that. It is based on the recommendations of both the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Australian Law Reform Commission. I think it is a perfectly acceptable argument that, if the Government is seeking information from an individual, it should provide that individual with the specific reason that the information is being collected. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment, by obliging the person or department collecting the information to inform the individual in writing as to why the information is being collected, will improve the situation to the greatest extent that we in this place are able to do. Written advice will necessarily require that the collector of the information sets down clearly what he or she believes to be the purpose of the collection. In this way, all sorts of vague verbal statements about the purpose will be avoided-statements that can be misunderstood, misheard, kept deliberately vague or even sound menacing in some instances. There is certainly much less opportunity for the written specific word being misinterpreted by either side compared with some vague verbal statement which gives people a general awareness of why the information is being collected. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Opposition sees its way clear to tighten up this particular IPP so that people of whom a request is made for information will receive the courtesy of being told precisely why the information is being collected. I do not wish to sound paranoid, but simply requiring that an individual is made generally aware of why the information is being requested can set all sorts of hares running in all sorts of directions. Fishing expeditions, to mix the metaphor thoroughly, are not unlikely under the current scenario. If somebody, when requesting information from an individual, has to say why that information is being requested, not only does the provider of the information know what he is getting himself into but also there is a possibility that he could challenge the reason, the need and the validity of the request. All of this legislation is hedged with a whole lot of if's and but's and apparent appeal mechanisms for people, most of which are after the event. At the very least I think we should give them some `before the event' information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government believes that the present provision is sensible and adequate. We do not want mountains of paper inundating the working of the system. It is believed that it is important that a person from whom information is solicited be generally aware of the purpose. Clearly, that would entail different steps in relation to different agencies. If one were applying for a benefit from Social Security or Veterans' Affairs and certain information was solicited, I guess the general reason for that requirement would be quite apparent. Clearly, it would be in relation to the obtaining of the benefit. It just seems to me to be an unnecessary complication to require in relation to each benefit that yet another piece of paper be produced. It is quite clear that the person wishing to obtain the benefit would be generally aware of the purpose for which the information was being sought with respect to status, income or situation. It is also the case that, as I say, these rather general rules will have to be applied in particular circumstances in greater detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 27 (1) (e) provides that the Privacy Commissioner has one of the following functions:</PARA>
<PARA>to prepare, and to publish in such manner as the Commissioner considers appropriate, guidelines for the avoidance of acts or practices of an agency that may or might be interferences with the privacy of individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that there would be circumstances in which the Privacy Commissioner, in relation to the activities of certain agencies, would see as a prudent and sensible guideline a requirement that something along the lines indicated by Senator Haines should be provided to a person from whom personal information is solicited. Once again, I think the Parliament really has to see how this legislation works. By that, I do not mean that people should be left exposed to mischievous, intimidating or wrongful claims that information must be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines spoke of some sort of general assertion that `we need the information'. That would not be sufficient. Even on the most lax reading of information privacy principle 2, it is quite clear that the person has to be made generally aware of the purpose for which the information is being collected and, further, has to be made aware, if the collection of the information is authorised or required by or under law, of the fact that the collection of the information is so authorised or required, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, consistent with information privacy principle (IPP) 2, one will find that soliciting of information could not be undertaken on a simple assertion of need for information due to something being intimidating or seductive. That would not be sufficient. One also has to go back to information privacy principle 1, which makes clear:</PARA>
<PARA>Personal information shall not be collected by a collector for inclusion in a record or in a generally available publication unless:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the information is collected for a purpose that is a lawful purpose directly related to a function or activity of the collector; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the collection of the information is necessary for or directly related to that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>It is paragraph (b) that is perhaps the more pertinent. I believe that, taking information privacy principle 1(b) in tandem with IPP 2-and all these information privacy principles are to be read together and are obviously cumulative in their impact-the sort of general framework that is provided is quite adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the arguments for and against the amendment, and I decide in favour of the Australian Democrats in this instance. I think the wording at present is just too vague and ambiguous. If these provisions are going to be vague and ambiguous-and they are stated to be information privacy principles-then they will cease to have any worthwhile value. My only reservation is that in some circumstances it might not be appropriate that the individual be informed in writing. Had the Government been more precise with this provision and stipulated that a person `be made aware of' the necessary details, I might have been more sympathetic to the Government's argument. However, the stipulation at present that an individual is to be made `generally aware of' the purpose for which the information is being collected, and so on, leaves an enormous gap in information privacy principle 2 and really defeats the purpose for which it has been included. On that basis, the Opposition supports the Democrats' amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Information privacy principle 3 relates to the solicitation of personal information generally. As this provision stands, it obliges collectors to ensure that information collected is up-to-date and complete. That seems reasonable enough. However, considering that this relates to departments that will be exchanging information-although it might not all be on the same database-I think there is an obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is accurate. The Minister can play semantics and talk about things being up-to-date and complete, but I think that, as per the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation, accuracy should be specifically stated as one of the criteria. My amendment would ensure that information is not only up-to-date and complete but also accurate. I do not want to get into a semantic dissertation, but is seems to me that it is better to stipulate `up-to-date, complete and accurate' in this provision, and to risk tautology perhaps, than to leave out one of those terms and risk an injustice. </PARA>

<PARA>This indicates a real obligation on the record keeper to ensure that the records are accurate. One finds a further dimension to this in information privacy principle 8, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>A record-keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall not use that information without taking such steps (if any) as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which the information is proposed to be used, the information is accurate, up to date and complete. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate has convinced me that `accurate' might as well be included in information privacy principle 3, because as he has already pointed out it is in principle 7, which is comforting, and that is in relation to alteration of records containing personal information and the obligation to ensure that deletions and additions are accurate. That is to be applauded. Further, information privacy principle 8 stipulates that a record keeper must check accuracy, et cetera of personal information before use; in other words, an obligation to ensure that the information is accurate, up-to-date and complete before it is used. That information privacy principle is also in a form of which we approve. Therefore, one asks why `up-to-date, complete and accurate' was not included in principle 3, relating to the solicitation of personal information generally. I can only presume that it was an oversight and it now looks as though we have the opportunity to correct that. Therefore, the Liberal Party of Australia supports the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (4) Page 13, clause 14, Information Privacy Principles, Principle 5, subparagraph 1 (b) (ii), line 4, leave out the subparagraph, insert:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(ii) each purpose for which that information is used;''</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Page 13, clause 14, Information Privacy Principles, Principle 5, after subparagraph 1 (b) (ii), insert the following new subparagraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(iia) the purposes of disclosure of records to third parties;</PARA>
<PARA> (iib) the record-keeper's policies and practices regarding storage of, retrievability of, access to, controls over, retention of and disposal of, records; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments relate to information privacy principle (IPP) 5, and that concerns the very principle that the Minister referred to a moment ago, namely, information relating to records kept by the record keeper. It seems to me that the obligations imposed on the record keeper by IPP 5 are inadequate as the provision now stands. The Australian Democrats' amendment would extend the obligation of the record keeper to require that person-and I have with some whimsy used the term that appears all the way through the legislation-`to take reasonable steps' to enable people to find out the purpose of disclosure of records to third parties and the record keeper's policies and practices in relation to storage of, retrievability of, access to, controls over and retention and/or disposal of records. I think the amendment will strengthen what is quite clearly a weak provision. People ought to have that sort of power over databases, records, or whatever, that contain information about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there must be obligations on the part of people who collect information and who periodically check and update it and ensure that it is accurate and so on to take all steps possible and reasonable to enable people to ascertain what is behind disclosure of those records to others. There are all sorts of instances where information is disclosed to third parties. I mentioned one this afternoon. According to a complainant who came to my office, Telecom Australia, without telling the individual concerned, had circulated that person's name to banks and other lending institutions, claiming that that individual was not creditworthy. It did that because a bill was outstanding, yet the outstanding bill, while certainly not for a very large amount, had never been received by the individual concerned. It seems to me that there is a moral obligation on people who hold information about citizens of this country, when they are going to divulge such information-presumably they will do it beforehand-to let the individual know. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already seen under the definitions in clause 6 that we are dealing with personal information that may not be true. The definition of `personal information' actually states that this means `information or an opinion . . . whether true or not . . . about an individual whose identity is apparent . . .'. I think it is pretty appalling if we have a situation where information on a person or an opinion about that person, whether it is true or not, can be disseminated to a third party without the person concerned being given preferably prior notice, but certainly some adequate notice. Our amendment, which leaves out a subparagraph and inserts another, would make sure that the reason the information is being released is provided to the individual concerned. I thought simple justice would have required that that be the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats. Whilst I can see what Senator Haines is trying to achieve, when one considers the range of manners in which an agency might be able legitimately to use information provided to it by a particular person, it might be impractical to require that each purpose for which the information could be used be outlined to a person. The example that I have been given is that the Department of Veterans' Affairs would hold personal information in order to provide a range of services to its clients. It also uses that information to provide other services to veterans. Information may be used in the provision of medical care and in the assessment of eligibility for housing under the defence service homes program. To have informed the veterans in the first instance of the main purpose for which the information was sought, perhaps in relation to the obtaining of a benefit, a level of benefit or some particular service, would, I believe, be an adequate indication of the reason the information was obtained by the agency concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to third parties and so on-once again this perhaps foreshadows some argument in relation to information privacy principles 10 and 11-the fact is that if we once again look at the IPPs as a whole, we see that information privacy principle 2 (e) requires notification of the usual disclosure practice at the time of collection. I repeat for the benefit of honourable senators that it requires:</PARA>
<PARA>any person to whom, or any body or agency to which, it is the collector's usual practice to disclose personal information of the kind so collected, and (if known by the collector) any person to whom, or any body or agency to which, it is the usual practice of that first-mentioned person, body or agency to pass on that information. </PARA>
<PARA>That obligation on the collector indicates, as Senator Haines said, that the person should be informed in advance, where possible, of the usual disclosure practices that might be involved in the use of the information made available to an agency. I have already indicated that under information privacy principle 5 there is a requirement for the notification of the main purpose for which the information is to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second part of amendment (5), the requirement concerning the record keeper's `policies and practices regarding storage of, retrievability of, access to, controls over, retention of and disposal of, records' et cetera, IPP 5 paragraph 1 (b) (iii) already provides for some of this material to be clearly set out. This is dealt with in a number of paragraphs, which I will not enumerate. A record keeper has to maintain a record setting out the steps to be taken to obtain access to information. No doubt the Privacy Commissioner will once again play a role in publishing guidelines for record keepers on the appropriate storage and security measures and the retrievability of, access to, controls over, retention of and disposal of records. I believe that once again the role of the Privacy Commissioner, as set out in functions enumerated in clause 27, will provide a much more detailed application of the matters which are of concern to Senator Haines. We are setting out a general structure here, and when the Privacy Commissioner gets to work I believe we will find that the more particular application of these general principles will be found to be more usefully applicable to the Commonwealth agencies concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would prefer the principles to be more precise rather than less precise. It seems to us that to provide an obligation to indicate the main purpose for which information is used not only can be unhelpful but also might place the record keeper himself or herself in a particularly difficult position. If personal information is held for government purposes, we cannot see why the person to whom such information relates should not be able to find out the purpose or, if it is held for a number of purposes, each of the purposes. It seems to us, therefore, that the Australian Democrats' amendment which refers to substituting `each purpose' for `the main purposes', as I read it, appears soundly based and we therefore support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subsequent two subclauses in the Democrats' amendment (5), which I think were advocated by the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, also appear to us to be reasonable. In effect, as has been said, they will ensure that where records are provided to third parties, the person to whom the records relate will be able to find out the purposes of disclosure of the records to such third parties. That seems to us to be reasonable. Furthermore, that person will be able to find out the records keeper's policies and practices regarding storage of, retrievability of, access to, controls over, retention of and disposal of, such records. We think it is reasonable that such a person can find out that information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister refers to how these things will work out in practice. If in due course, the administration finds that these principles are providing such onerous obligations that they in effect bog down the efficient management of bureaucratic function, no doubt the Government will come back to this Parliament with amendments and, presumably, evidence to substantiate the fact that the principles have become too certain in their application. As far as we are concerned, at this stage in trying to put these provisions in place we would prefer to see them, as I said, more precise rather than less precise. We will therefore support the Democrats' amendments 4 and 5. </PARA>

However, there is a vast difference between the record keeper maintaining a record setting out all of those things and the person about whom the record is kept knowing all of those things.

A little bit of commonsense has to be used, particularly in regard to the fact that, once again, the Privacy Commissioner as we all know is required to be given a copy of the record so maintained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister that there are 16 1/2 million people living in this country, at least half-if not all-of whom, presumably, will have records kept on them. I fail to see how simply making the record, maintained under principle 5.3, available for inspection by members of the public, will mean that they are going to have access to that or will know where to have access or that they will benefit from having access. Having access to it could well mean plonking eight million pieces of information down and saying, `Go to it, son'. What we are simply saying-I am pleased to see the Opposition supporting this-is that it has to be made perfectly clear to the persons about whom the information is being kept that they can have access to this information; that they can know the purpose for which the information is being used; that they can know the purposes of disclosure of records to third parties; and that they can know the record keeper's policies and practices regarding storage of, retrievability of, access to, controls over, retention of and disposal of records.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without moving an amendment, I would like to raise a question with regard to principle 6 which continues to relate to access to records containing personal information. Principle 6 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Where a record-keeper has possession or control of a record that contains personal information, the individual concerned shall be entitled to have access to that record, except to the extent that the record-keeper is required or authorised to refuse to provide the individual with access to that record under the applicable provisions of any law of the Commonwealth that provides for access by persons to documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Any law of the Commonwealth would of course include the Freedom of Information Act. Conceivably, it could be used to deny, for example, corrections to inaccurate personal information. We have just had a dissertation on the information privacy principals (IPPs) that require up-to-dateness and accuracy. Yet one of the ways in which information can be checked by an individual is through a freedom of information request. It is bad enough that those are being made excessively expensive by the hourly costs and the various appeals costs, but to have this catch-all clause in principle 6 is suspicious, to say the very least. Why is it necessary? I would not have thought that correction rights should be tied to the purposes for which information is collected. I would have thought that it would not prejudice government interests, or anything else, if those correction rights were made available. I do not have an amendment to principle 6, the Minister will be relieved to know, but I would like to know why there is no capacity for general correction of information by the person concerned. Why are we excluding any law of the Commonwealth in this case? To what extent in fact is the freedom of information legislation going to be used to hamper people in providing record keepers referred to in other IPPs with accurate information?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, it is true that principle 6 has regard to the question of freedom of information (FOI) legislation which will provide, as the Parliament determined, that certain records in certain situations will not be disclosed to a person seeking them. That is fairly straightforward. It is quite sensible for this legislation to note that particular situation applying under FOI legislation. It is, however, worth having some regard to clauses 34 and 35 of the Bill which allow the Privacy Commissioner to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . direct the agency to add to the document an appropriate notation setting out particulars of the amendments of the document that the Commissioner thinks should be made. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 15, clause 14, Information Privacy Principles, Principle 10, at end of clause 2, add ``and a note that the consent of the individual concerned was obtained''. </PARA>
<PARA>Principle 10 relates to limits on the use of personal information. Principle 10 (1) (d) permits the use and disclosure of personal information where it is reasonably necessary to do so for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of the public revenue. I would suggest that there is practically nothing that happens in this country that does not have something to do with the public revenue, either increasing it or decreasing it. If we are talking about a catch-all provision, the term `protection of the public revenue' is it. I cannot conceive of any piece of information about anybody that does not somehow relate to the protection of the public revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Every child who is born is going to be picked up under this law because the parents are getting family allowance for that child. So virtually from birth principle 10 (1) (d) permits the use and disclosure of personal information on almost anybody, because public revenue is involved. All tax collecting and benefit providing authorities of the Commonwealth will be able, under this clause, to use and disclose personal information on the grounds that the public revenue is involved and needs protecting. Worse, it probably makes most government departments exempt from the two most important information privacy principles (IPPs) for most of their activities. That catch-all provision of protection of public revenue appears in principle 11. Principles 10 and 11 mean that any government department can use and disclose personal information, using the argument that the protection of public revenue is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are numerous examples from overseas-the United States is a classic example-showing what happens when inaccurate computer information is used against or released about people. Again, I refer honourable senators to the definition of `personal information', which contains that rather extraordinary clause `whether true or not'. It is conceivably possible for people to use and disclose information based on opinions which may not be true, if we consider the terms in which personal information is defined, and do so with no sanction against them because they complain that it is dealing with the protection of public revenue. I give as an example the issue that I raised about the woman who advertised for somebody to rent her house during the Grand Prix. It would be possible to argue that her Department of Social Security number was released to make sure that she was not renting that property and not declaring it. The person concerned could say, `Of course I disclosed that information. It was to ensure that the money she was given for renting that home during the Grand Prix was not squirrelled away by her somewhere and not disclosed because it could have affected her pension'. </PARA>
<PARA> We can argue the merits of whether people should rort the system. Most of us believe that they should not. But the line needs to be drawn when we consider that the words `true or not' and `opinion' appear in the definition of personal information. The term `protecting the public revenue' is thrown into IPPs 10 and 11. It is quite an extraordinary conjunction of terms that could lead to some massive release of information which nobody could challenge. The Privacy Commissioner could not argue against it, an injunction could not stop it, an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal could not produce a positive result from it and a court case would not stand up on it. All that the record keeper would have to do is say, `We disclosed that information, we used that information, because it was necessary to do so for the enforcement of the criminal law', or, more likely, `for the protection of the public revenue however tenuous that protection may be'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to argue about the need to enforce the criminal law or to involve a law imposing a pecuniary penalty. That catch-all about the protection of public revenue means that there is no recipient of social security-I remind honourable senators that that includes people who receive family allowance benefits-taxpayer, invalid pensioner or hardly a person alive in Australia who is not going to find that information can be used and disclosed because it is somehow linked with the protection of the public revenue. Of all of the amendments that we have moved tonight the amendments relating to IPP 10 and IPP 11 are probably the most necessary as far as real protection of the privacy of individuals is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already ascertained tonight that there is not a common database. More importantly, we have learned that there is a linkage between databases and that relevant information is exchanged. That means that the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security are going to be exchanging information. That Department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Community Services and Health are the main departments dealing with the protection of government revenue. People picked up in this way, including primary producers involved in income equalisation schemes, will find that information about them can be used and disclosed because public revenue is involved and has to be protected. Again, I remind the Committee that we are talking not about hard data but about opinion, in some cases, and information, whether true or not, that is kept on records. That is how personal information is defined in this Bill. I notice that Senator Puplick has joined Senator Hill in the chamber. He was on the original joint committee, as I was, and I know that one of his principal concerns was to ensure that information could not be misused on specious grounds. If ever I have seen a catch-all that can be used and abused by people who wish to do so, this protection of the public revenue is it. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to the Committee the amendments dealing with information privacy principles. I remind it that people have been suspected of and sometimes taken to court for tax or social security benefit fraud as a result of inaccurate information, sometimes maliciously provided by other people in the community. Sometimes this has happened because of computer error. Whatever else people out in the world might think to the contrary, computers have been known to be wrong because the human programmers have hit the wrong key or reversed two numbers. The inaccuracy of the information can simply be the result of a data process error-comparing like with unlike data or not putting in sufficient information so that a particular transaction looks suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the need for public disclosure, review and assessment of those programs is overwhelming. At the very least, it should be necessary for individuals to consent to the use and disclosure of information, because before they can consent they have to be told about the use and disclosure and, presumably, the contents of what is to be used and disclosed, which gives them some capacity to see whether the information is accurate, whether it has been taken out of context and whether it is being used fairly. I acknowledge that our amendments are not perfect solutions to this problem, but they go some way to correcting what could be one of the more massive injustices perpetrated under this so-called privacy legislation, which appears to contain more protections for the department concerned than for the individual. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was quite unfair of Senator Haines to conclude by saying that this is so-called privacy legislation which favours departments over individuals. However, it is true that in relation to information privacy principles 10 and 11, which for the first time set down limits on the use and disclosure of personal information, there is a recognition of the overriding public interest which has already been recognised by this Parliament in various situations. I make it absolutely clear, as the explanatory memorandum does, that the information privacy principles do not override the secrecy provisions that are to be found in various pieces of Commonwealth legislation. There is no catch-all provision, as I think Senator Haines called it, which opens the floodgates to all sorts of abuse by overriding the safeguards which the Parliament has erected, particularly in relation to the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind Senator Haines that in relation to the Taxation Office and, in particular, section 16 of the taxation law, which deals with the obligation on officers to observe secrecy, the Parliament itself provides for certain authorised recipients of information-in other words, certain exceptions-once again, in the public interest. One authorised recipient of information from the Commissioner of Taxation is the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, for the purpose of the administration of any law of the Commonwealth relating to pensions, allowances or benefits. So the Parliament has already recognised that even in relation to section 16 of the taxation law, which remains in place and in force and is not displaced by principle 11 1 (e) or 10 1 (d)-in this case we are talking about 11 1 (e) which deals with disclosure-there are situations where it is in order to ensure that Commonwealth laws relating to pensions, allowances or benefits are properly administered and that only those persons who are truly entitled to those allowances, pensions and benefits obtain them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not true to say, as I think Senator Haines did at one stage, that all that was needed was some very tenuous connection-I think the phrase she used was `however tenuous'-for the requirement of the enforcement of the criminal law or the protection of the public revenue to be established. What is required in information privacy principle 11 is that the disclosure be reasonably necessary. That is a matter which can be subjected to the scrutiny of the Privacy Commissioner. I believe that it would be quite impossible for an agency to decide arbitrarily that information can be transferred willy-nilly on most tenuous grounds because the agency will know that ultimately the Privacy Commissioner, who has access to all transactions and transfers of information by agencies, will be able to assess whether a particular disclosure was reasonably necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the great fear that Senator Haines seems to have about the disclosure of information flowing the other way, to the Taxation Office, it might be of interest to the Committee to recall the words of the former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mr Ian Temby, who has commented on the need for exchanges of information by agencies in order to combat fraud on the Commonwealth. In a speech to the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration entitled `Impediments to Tackling Fraud' on 2 May this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Accepting that there is a need to safeguard the handling of information which may be private, confidential and sensitive nevertheless it becomes an absurdity when fraud on the Commonwealth is facilitated by the enforced lack of communication between agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that we must recognise as a very necessary fact that, if we are to combat fraud, there needs to be, when reasonably necessary, that flow of information which enables the criminal law to be enforced or the public revenue to be protected. Indeed, it is not uncommon for the Australian Federal Police (AFP) or the Director of Public Prosecutions to make information available to the Australian Taxation Office which enables the Taxation Office to raise an assessment and to audit particular cases-for example, where the Federal Police become aware that a person is deriving income from illegal activities such as drug trafficking. The Australian Taxation Office relies to an extent on Australian Federal Police and DPP information to identify and audit cases where those involved in criminal activity are clearly at the same time not making available to the Tax Office the proper extent of their revenue. That is rather a big program of auditing within the Tax Office which clearly allows for the recovery of many millions of dollars to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> So I believe that there are instances where dramatic and colourful scenarios can be painted. As I say, these information flows have already been recognised by the Parliament as necessary in order to protect the public purse against abuse. I think it is obvious to most people that to require that a person consent in writing to the notification by one agency, to the AFP for example, of personal information held which might enable the AFP to undertake an investigation is so absurd that it cannot seriously be contemplated, in that a person would be put on notice that an investigation by the law enforcement authorities was taking place. That cannot be seriously put forward as a way in which the proper balance between public interest and the privacy of personal information might be achieved. I do not believe that the Australian Democrats' amendments would properly achieve that balance. In fact they would undo much of the work which this Parliament has already put on the statute book, with safeguards, but recognising that exceptions have to be made in certain situations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will probably fall from favour with the Australian Democrats again at this point, because we oppose these amendments. We do so basically because it is my view, with the greatest of respect, that Senator Haines has misinterpreted this provision. I do not see that protection of the public revenue should be read as a final catch-all. Rather, it should be read as qualified by the provisions that precede it. It seems to me that principle 10 1 (d) is looking at areas of provision of information in criminal law cases, in cases that involve a pecuniary penalty and then in the protection of the public revenue, and that it clearly relates to situations of abuse or potential abuse of the public revenue. Therefore, if I am correct in that interpretation, what we would be doing by agreeing to this amendment is potentially hindering the operation of the criminal law. We have no wish to do that. I think we would find that there would be very few cases in which consent would be obtained in order that such information could be used in criminal cases. We think that it is important that a proper balance be found and we are concerned that if we agreed to this amendment that balance would not be maintained and that we would, as I said, be running the risk of hindering the effective prosecution of the criminal law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did acknowledge when I was speaking to these amendments-and I will include in those the two amendments to information privacy principle (IPP) 11 as well, although I have not moved them, and will not be proceeding to move them because the same fate will befall them, I suspect: I will confine myself to simply speaking about them-that I did not require that the consent be in writing, just that it be given and noted; but that is a minor detail. I am still very concerned about-I think we are all concerned about it in this place; it is simply a matter of finding a form of words that does not cause one concern to change into another problem-the fact that information can be used and disclosed without the knowledge of an individual, without giving that individual the opportunity to correct the information, and that this could lead to certain injustices. I accept the fact that, as Senator Hill said, there will be instances where consent will be refused and that this will hinder the enforcement of the criminal law. It may well be that the best brains in this place can come up with some amendments to IPPs 10 and 11 that protect the rights of the individual so that he is aware of what is happening and is given the opportunity to make corrections and to insist on accuracies in the database without in any way impeding the collection of revenues and stopping the pursuit of defrauders of the system, but at the moment it is absolutely irrefutable that principle 10 in particular is deficient. I think we need to look much more closely at this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has said on a number of occasions that we ought to leave the legislation alone and wait to see whether any problems arise, and then take some steps to attend to them. Since I am not going to get those amendments supported by either side, I ask the Minister to add those principles to his list of areas we are going to watch to see whether problems arise and in relation to which we will duly look for ways in which we can protect the rights of individuals without impeding the legitimate actions by departments for protecting the public revenue and for enforcing the criminal law or the law imposing a pecuniary penalty. </PARA>

I will undertake to ensure that as far as possible a full report on the use of clause 27 (1) (h) relating back to the notation of records, which is dealt with in accordance with principles 10 1 (d) and 11 1 (e), is made available to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) I present a statement relating to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and I table the policy discussion paper entitled AIDS: a time to care, a time to act-Towards a strategy for Australians. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Just over three years ago, the Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, first addressed the Parliament on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA> He said, and I quote `AIDs is potentially one of the most serious and expensive public health problems to face Australia since Federation . . . both as individuals and as a community, AIDS poses a potential threat to us all.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reported that in Australia, as at May 17, 1985, there had been 79 cases of AIDS, of which 32 had died, and it had been estimated that some tens of thousands of Australians had been exposed to the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically, the events of the past three years have borne out the reality of that warning. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, on November 22, 1988, this country has suffered 1,100 cases of AIDS, and 538 of those people are dead. It is believed that between 15,000 and 25,000 people are infected with the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> For almost every day that has passed since that first statement, AIDS has struck another Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA> In this short time, the disease has already taken a great toll on the Australian community in terms of lives lost, threatened and ruined, and untold human suffering for people infected by the virus, their relatives, friends and carers. </PARA>
<PARA> As Dr Blewett told the Third National Conference on AIDS in Hobart last August, not since World War I has Australia been confronted with similar potential for damage to an entire generation. </PARA>
<PARA> And still the number of cases of AIDS mounts inexorably. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's prediction that AIDS would change our lives forever, challenging our deepest cultural, social and moral values, has come true, but so too has his hope that we would find the national maturity and strength to confront the virus with sensitivity, commonsense and determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The early initiative taken by the federal government has been followed by Australia's scientific and medical communities, state governments, community groups, particularly in the homosexual community, and the media. Our cooperative commitment has established urgent education, prevention, screening, counselling and treatment services and successfully secured Australia's blood product supply services. The bipartisan approach we have adopted in our fight against the virus-an approach exemplified by the work of the parliamentary liaison group on aids-has allowed us to rationally take quite radical decisions to protect public health and to minimise reactions born out of fear, ignorance and prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, we have been able to openly face up to, and come to grips with, the need for public discussion and advocacy of condoms for safer sex, the acknowledgment of bisexual, as well as homosexual, preferences in Australian society, and the distribution of free clean needles and syringes to drug addicts. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has earned international acclaim for strategies to combat the virus which are viewed as exceptionally coherent, innovative and effective. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall probably never know the quantitative extent of our success to date, although there is no doubt that some lives have been saved and some suffering avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> But what we do know, as an inescapable certainty, is that we cannot rest on our laurels. For the foreseeable future, AIDS is here to stay. This lethal virus will be a fact of life for our children's children. Much can be done to moderate its force, but it cannot be made to disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> The harsh reality for Australia is that the AIDS epidemic in this country is still in its infancy; the long haul is only just beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> We now stand at the threshold of a new period in our response to the epidemic, a period in which we must make difficult choices about how we deal with AIDS in the decades ahead-choices which will dictate the success or failure of our attempts to stem the tide. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues are complex-technically, legally and socially-and touch upon almost every area of our daily lives-health, housing, education, job security, insurance, welfare services, and our personal freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy discussion paper which I am tabling today AIDS: A Time to Care, a Time to Act: Towards a Strategy for all Australians, presents the issues which we must now address and discuss options for their resolution. It is the first step in the development of a national strategy to guide Australia in the management of AIDS during the next stages of the epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment of Australian governments to strive for agreement on a uniform strategy is best demonstrated by the fact that this discussion paper is, in a historic example of bipartisan consensus, being tabled in every parliament of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I must pay tribute to officers of the Department of Community Services and Health and others who have contributed to the preparation of the discussion document, particularly Elizabeth Reid, who has worked tirelessly to produce a document unprecedented in its comprehensiveness, but which still remains relevant to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is testimony to the skills and efforts of Ms Reid and the editorial team that the discussion paper has been endorsed as a suitable basis for public discussion by both the Australian National Council on Aids (ANCA) and the Inter-Governmental Committee on Aids. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also stress that the discussion paper does not represent Federal Government Policy, or the policy of any State or Territory Government. Rather, it presents the facts, issues, options and arguments upon which the Australian people need to draw before they, through their governments, can chart a rational and reasoned course for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of the paper outlines what is known about the AIDS epidemic in Australia: how many people might be infected; how infection has and has not occurred; the way infection affects people; what evidence we have of people changing their behaviour; and the resources-human and financial-demanded, to date, by the epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA> This part of the paper provides the factual information needed to understand the nature of the problem and to elicit informed and appropriate responses. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the paper proposes a framework for a national AIDS strategy, and identifies three broad objectives for such a strategy:</PARA>
<PARA> to minimise transmission of the virus;</PARA>
<PARA> to support, care for and to treat infected people; and</PARA>
<PARA> to educate and to prevent the infection of people who care for infected individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>While the first two of these objectives have been accepted components of our national approach from the outset, identification of the third recognises the increasingly important role played by people who care for AIDS sufferers-health care workers, families, friends and volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA> Because many of the issues on which policies are needed are extremely complex, the paper identifies some key principles to guide discussion and development of strategies. Agreement on these basic principles would be a major step towards consensus on a national approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this, the second part of the paper, that the most difficult, and frequently emotive, issues are presented for debate: testing, contact tracing, legal impediments to prevention programs, prevention strategies in prisons, occupational transmission and workplace education, to name but a few. </PARA>
<PARA> The last part of the paper deals with Australia's involvement in the international response to the global pandemic, with the research needed to support a National AIDS Strategy, and with monitoring and evaluating the strategy's programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion paper canvasses numerous sensitive questions in a frank and forthright style designed to achieve increased understanding and awareness of the issues at stake and a willingness to seriously consider all of the available options so that the simplistic and superficially attractive approaches will not become the natural first choices. </PARA>
<PARA> As such, this document is bound to generate widespread discussion of subjects often inhibited in public debate. Such discussion should be encouraged as of central importance to the structuring of a considered, coherent and cooperative national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that the discussion paper will be read and discussed by every section of the Australian community. Every Australian will have the opportunity to participate in the consultative process, as individuals, through community groups, through their elected parliamentary representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that the issues will be debated in every medium and in every forum, including this and other Australian parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> The responses elicited from this national debate will be incorporated in the next stage of the preparation of a national strategy: the development of a policy statement on AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> This second document, to be completed in time for consideration in the 1989-90 budget context, will set out a clear, broad national strategy to combat the disease and will delineate areas of responsibility for Federal, State and local governments, as well as other elements of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy document will contain a definitive statement of the Commonwealth's policies on AIDS and will, within the strategy it outlines, set out the parameters for funding, administering, coordinating and monitoring AIDS programs and activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The preparation of this policy statement will take account of advice from advisory bodies, such as the Australian National Council on AIDS and the Inter-Governmental Committee on AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion paper provides a framework for the formulation of a national strategy, to which all governments can be committed in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be naive in the extreme to believe that we can achieve consensus on every issue raised and detailed decision to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> There will, of course, continue to be diversity of opinion between different States, different communities, different organisations and different individuals, and that diversity will be reflected in the range of programs established to respond to the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> The preparation of a national strategy does not negate a diversity of responses-indeed, different approaches and different programs expand both our knowledge of the virus and the options available for dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> But a national strategy does seek a uniform commitment to principles, the acceptance of which and adherence to which are essential to containment of the epidemic-the difference, if you like, between lives and deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles are self-evident when we carefully consider the medical, scientific and social evidence available to guide us in retaining the trust, support and cooperation of the whole Australian community in protecting this nation's public health. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles recognise that public health and human rights must march hand in hand where AIDS is concerned; that each is needed to reinforce the effectiveness of the other. </PARA>
<PARA> And above all, they recognise that, in the continuing absence of any effective vaccine or cure for the virus, our overriding goal must remain that of persuading people to change their behaviour so that they do not become infected. </PARA>
<PARA> In tabling this policy discussion paper, I would like to finish as I began, by reiterating to you part of the speech which the Minister for Health delivered three years ago-words which, despite the passage of time and events, are as relevant today as they were then. </PARA>
<PARA> He said: `In developing a national AIDS strategy, Australian health ministers need the active cooperation and support of their parliaments and the community. The Government seeks today the support, cooperation and understanding of honourable members on both sides of this House as we develop a strategy to combat this insidious disease and its tragic consequences'. </PARA>
<PARA> We should have no doubts that now is a time to care; a time to act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement and the policy discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has now been presented with a ministerial statement attached to a report entitled AIDS: a time to care, a time to act-Towards a strategy for Australians. This is a policy discussion paper on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) crisis. AIDS presents us with a huge variety of both threats and challenges. In the first instance, medically it presents us with the challenge of providing for care and searching for cure. Socially, it presents us with the challenges of social dislocation and personal distress. Legally, it presents us with the challenges of discrimination and the threats to our civil liberties. Economically, it poses the challenges of loss of income for thousands of people who are affected and enormous strains on the public health expenditure of the Commonwealth and the States. Above all, AIDS is a personal, human and individual tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> It challenges our tolerance as human beings and as a community. It challenges the political willingness of governments to act and very often to take decisions in the face of public opinion, particularly when that public opinion is ill informed. AIDS is a worldwide problem and a worldwide phenomenon. It wreaks havoc in Central Africa and in some of the most underprivileged parts of the world. It presents crises in some of the most affluent cities of western Europe, North America and increasingly, one regrets to say, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A remarkable book was published quite recently, the author of which was Randy Shilts, a journalist working in San Francisco. The book is entitled And the Band Played On. I suspect this title is taken from the apocryphal stories about the sinking of the Titanic. In the prologue to the book, Shilts makes a number of points including that it was only after the announced death of the movie actor, Rock Hudson, on 2 October 1985 that people were prepared to confront the AIDS epidemic in a way which recognised that it was a problem not simply of some closeted minority but indeed a problem that the whole community had to face. In the prologue Shilts says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> The timing of this awareness, however, reflected the unalterable tragedy at the heart of the AIDS epidemic. By the time America paid attention to the disease, it was too late to do anything about it. The virus was already pandemic in the nation, having spread to every corner of the North American continent. The tide of death that would later sweep America could, perhaps, be slowed, but it could not be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere in that prologue Shilts says:</PARA>
<PARA> There was no excuse, in this country and in this time, for the spread of a deadly new epidemic. For this was a time in which the United States boasted the world's most sophisticated medicine and the world's most extensive public health system, geared to eliminate such pestilence from our national life. When the virus appeared, the world's richest nation housed the most lavishly financed scientific research establishments-both inside the vast governmental health bureaucracy and in other institutions-to investigate new diseases and quickly bring them under control. </PARA>
<PARA>We, in Australia, are perhaps fortunate that we have been able to learn from some of the American experiences. Nevertheless, despite the fact that we have the opportunity to learn, we also have some quite frightening statistics. We know for example that the cumulative case analysis of people suffering from AIDS in Australia has now reached 1,079, of whom 525 persons have already died. </PARA>

<PARA>Paediatric AIDS: seven children aged less than 5 years have developed AIDS in Australia. Of these, 6 resulted from contaminated blood transfusions and one was congenitally acquired from an HIV infected intra-venous drug using mother. Two children aged between 5 and 10 years developed AIDS both from infected blood or blood products. An additional 3 children aged between 10 and 15 years developed AIDS. Two resulted from contaminated blood or blood products and the third from a contaminated organ through transplantation. All 12 children received their blood, blood products or organ prior to the introduction of routine screening of all potential blood, tissue or organ donors in early 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is yet to be written the definitive history of the AIDS epidemic in Australia. In particular, there has yet to be written the socio-political history of the AIDS epidemic in Australia. Undoubtedly, somebody is at work on it; undoubtedly, somebody's PhD thesis is nearing completion. I believe that we, as a nation, can take some comfort in the way in which there has been an attempt to bring together all the disparate elements which are necessary if we are to put in place an AIDS strategy which will work. There has been a remarkably bipartisan approach to handling most of the sensitive issues with which the AIDS epidemic has confronted us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this institution we have, for example, the parliamentary liaison committee on AIDS which has met for some years now under the chairmanship of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). It has on it representatives of all the major political parties and the independent members in the Senate. By and large we have had a good degree of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in an area where, notoriously, rivalries, jealousies and disputations have occurred in the past. We have had a remarkable degree of cooperation between the gay community and the wider Australian community in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had remarkable cooperation with individual groups such as the Haemophilia Society with people concerned with the blood transfusion services, with people involved in nursing, with people involved in research, with people involved in education, with people at universities, with people who work in the clinical side of the management of this disease. Although from time to time there have been disputes, rivalries, jealousies and arguments about funding and status and all the other things one comes to expect in an area of public policy as complicated as this, nevertheless I think that as a nation we have handled this crisis remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite recently my friend and colleague Peter Shack, the shadow Minister for Health, prepared a paper entitled Understanding AIDS: A Necessary First Step Towards Proper Policy Development which he circulated extensively within the ranks of the coalition parties in an attempt to improve from our perspective the understanding of the AIDS crisis. It was an attempt to set forth in non-judgmental and non-technical language answers to the questions which each of us needs to understand in order to decide whether public policy being advocated by government is correct and is likely to achieve its stated goals and hoped-for outcomes. There have been numerous reports on the subject of AIDS in Australia. I draw the attention of the Senate to a couple of them. AIDS: Australia's Response Examined, a report of the second national conference on AIDS held on 31 October and 1 November 1986, is a very significant and useful document. The proceedings of the World Health Organisation Australian Inter-regional Ministerial Meeting on AIDS, held at Westmead Hospital in Sydney in July 1987, included the presentation of a large number of papers of great importance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that this World Health Organisation-sponsored conference, which was supported by authorities in Australia, was opened by His Excellency the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen. I pay great tribute to His Excellency for the way in which he has been prepared to lend the high prestige and respect of his office to the national campaign to do something about AIDS. His Excellency has served as a patron of the AIDS Trust of Australia. His willingness to participate and make significant contributions to international conferences and to national fora and seminars on this question indicates the extent to which he has been prepared to use high office in the most valuable service to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Here in the Parliament the Legislative Research Service recently produced a document entitled AIDS-The Social Issues, a most comprehensive and useful examination of social policy questions which we as parliamentarians and law makers have to face up to. The report entitled AIDS and the Workplace, a national consensus statement, was agreed to by all Australian governments at Federal, State and Territory level, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. There has been a coming together of people in the workplace, of unionists and employers, of Commonwealth and State governments, to attempt to lay down guidelines for dealing with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been investigations on the financial side of things. I look at the report produced by Touche Ross International for the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health entitled Costing the AIDS Epidemic in Australia which was published in March 1988. So there has been an attempt to come to an evaluation of the economic side of this problem. I will dwell for a moment on that side of the problem; it is something which in the climate in which we spend so much time talking about costs and prices needs to be at least mentioned in passing this evening. The report which we have before us estimates that the AIDS epidemic costs Australia somewhere in the vicinity of $400m a year in treatment costs and lost productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> If I look at an article which appeared in the journal Science in February 1988 entitled `The Economic Impact of AIDS in the United States', by Bloom and Carliner, I see that they calculate that, on the worst cost scenario projected in the United States, the public health expenditure costs of treating AIDS between 1981 and 1991 will be in the vicinity of $22 billion. I look at extracts from the public health reports of the United States in July 1987 and I read from the introduction of that report:</PARA>
<PARA>According to what the authors consider their best estimates, personal medical costs of AIDS in current dollars will rise from $630m in 1985 to $1.1 billion in 1986, to $8.5 billion in 1991. Non-personal costs for research, screening, education and general support services are estimated to rise from $319m in 1985 to $542m in 1986, and $2.3 billion in 1991. Indirect costs attributable to loss of productivity resulting from morbidity and premature mortality are estimated to rise from $3.9 billion in 1985 to $7 billion in 1986 and $55.6 billion in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are talking about vast sums of public money, going to the health and care system in Australia at a greater rate and greater level than we have ever had to confront in the past. The United States, as Shilts's book indicates, was slow off the mark in this regard. In fact, it has only recently come to the position which we achieved in Australia some years ago. On 24 June 1988 there was presented to the President of the United States a report of the Presidential Commission on the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus Epidemic, the so-called Watkins report-after its Chairman, retired United States Admiral James D. Watkins. In his report Admiral Watkins says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has identified the following obstacles to a nationwide effort to improve the public's response to and participation in programs designed to quantify the HIV epidemic at the federal, state and local levels:</PARA>
<PARA>Continued focus on the label ``AIDS'', contributing to a lack of understanding of the importance of HIV infection as the more significant element for taking control of the epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA>Lack of strong CDC-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, centres for disease control-</PARA>
<PARA>leadership in the public health community for obtaining and coordinating HIV infection data. </PARA>
<PARA>Lack of uniform and strong anti-discrimination laws protecting those infected with HIV. </PARA>
<PARA>Excessive concern about potential problems with testing programs and reporting systems. </PARA>
<PARA>Inadequate counselling resources to assist those tested makes many support and interest groups reluctant to recommend widespread HIV testing. </PARA>
<PARA>All those issues in the Watkins report have been addressed in a number of reports in Australia over past years and have been addressed once again in the report which we have before us presented by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) on behalf of the Minister for Community Services and Health this evening. The Minister's tabling statement included this point, which I think it is important to understand and to accept:</PARA>
<PARA>The harsh reality for Australia is that the AIDS epidemic in this country is still in its infancy; the long haul is only just beginning. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is correct. What we are looking at at the moment-which I have already described as a crisis and which other people have already described as a crisis-is a picture frozen in time. It is in many respects, because of the nature of the virus and its manifestation, the picture as it was some years ago. We do not know the real situation as of today. We know today of those who were infected some years ago and who are now starting to manifest the various symptoms of the HIV infection. We do not know yet, nor will we know for five, six, seven or perhaps eight years, exactly what today's situation is in Australia. That is something yet to be revealed to us. The only thing that one can say with confidence is that it will be worse, and that in itself is a further challenge for our medical resources, our medical researchers and our public policy analysts and planners. </PARA>
<PARA> I pause in my discussion of this report to draw attention to the fact that in the Minister's tabling statement he makes reference to the skill and dedication of Miss Elizabeth Reid, who has been the Government's primary adviser in the development of this discussion document. I would like to say on my own behalf and on behalf of all coalition senators--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the support of my colleague Senator Peter Baume-that the work which Miss Reid has undertaken has been of outstanding national value. She knows a great deal, for all sorts of reasons, about the AIDS tragedy. She has contributed in a remarkable way to the development of public policy in Australia and we are very much in her debt for the amount of effort which she has made in that regard. The report, AIDS: a time to care, a time to act-Towards a strategy for Australians, identifies the very broad outlines of a national strategy and it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Three objectives for a national AIDS strategy are proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) To minimise transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to support, care for and treat people infected with HIV; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to educate and to prevent the infection of people who care for HIV infected individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a document which proposes anything more than a broad strategy; it is a document which sets out options, facts and alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is calling for public comment on this document to be received by him through a coordinating committee, until January next year. It is then proposed that in about May next year the Government will release a White Paper in which it will indicate its responses to the recommendations which have been put before it by both its expert advisers and the community and that will have some impact on decisions to be made for the 1989 Federal Budget. This is already a major Budget item. In the current Budget, $15.1m has been added into the Medicare hospital funding arrangements with the States to deal specifically with the treatment of AIDS patients. A further $25m is provided in 1988-89 of which $12.5m, including an additional $1.7m, has been allocated to a cost-sharing program with the States for education, prevention and counselling. Also, an amount of $12.5m includes an additional $1.3m for the national program covering research, media and education campaigns, community projects and information exchange programs. So we are already talking, even within the smaller Australian context, of large dollar sums. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the report does not attempt to make any definitive recommendations to government; its purpose is to start the next phase of the discussion. Therefore, I will draw attention to one or two matters which I think are important and which need to be addressed. The first-and in many ways I think the most important-is what are the appropriate educational strategies? I refer to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association of 12 August 1988 entitled `Stockholm Speakers on Adolescents and AIDS: ``Catch them before they catch it'' '. This report of the Fourth International Conference on AIDS, held in Stockholm, refers to the question of strategies designed primarily to address the behavioural changes which are necessary in adolescents in order to prevent them from engaging in risk behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is the appropriate point at which to say that the question of AIDS is not a question of who you are; it is a question of how you behave. It is the behaviour modification rather than the categorisation of persons which is important in the public debate. It is, as I say, not who you are and not in that sense what you are, but how you behave which is central to the question of the control and eventual, one hopes, tackling of the general problem as far as AIDS is concerned. Of course, this leads one into complex and difficult areas. For example, we know that both the Tasmanian and Queensland State governments have had some difficulty in recent times with some of the educational material which has been circulated and which is designed to appeal to certain categories of individuals and to persuade people engaging in certain types of behaviour to seek behaviour modification. In fact, those State governments have had difficulty allowing the promotional activities of the `Safe Sex' campaign to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be large areas of disagreement about the future prognosis for the community with respect to this disease. I refer to the transcript of a program called AIDS Now, which was broadcast on 7 September 1988 and which dealt with the question, `AIDS: Is there going to be a heterosexual epidemic?'. Dr Charles Farthing, Physician of St Stephen's Hospital, London, said:</PARA>
<PARA> A heterosexual epidemic is absolutely certain to occur. There's no question about that, it's just a matter of when, and how quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association of April 1988 entitled `Preventing the Heterosexual Spread of AIDS' indicates that there are contrary views. It states that in fact that will not be the prognosis for the disease and that the widespread growth of AIDS within the heterosexual community is not something which is inevitable. So there continues to be disputation even among scientists and government advisers. Of course, there is an enormous political dimension to this. For example, a book recently published entitled The Myth of heterosexual AIDS argues that the AIDS public policy debate in the United States of America has been taken over by certain vested interests and groups and in fact has been steered in a political direction rather than in a direction which properly reflects the demands and requirements of public health policy in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will list-without attempting in any sense to explore any of the issues-the sorts of issues which this paper raises and which need to be addressed. There is the question of cost and the question of the direction of research. There is the question of treatment and the availability of pharmaceuticals. There are the questions of discrimination and confidentiality of record keeping. There are questions of advertising and of education. There are questions of how to reach the intravenous drug users who may be the primary conduit of the spread of the virus into the heterosexual community, including disputes about free heroin programs or the availability of needle exchange programs. There is the question of how one deals with the prison population. There is the question of how one deals with the peculiarities of this disease in the Aboriginal community. There is the question of how one reaches and deals with the prostitutes in Australia. There are questions of insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are questions of safety in the workplace and, perhaps above all, there are questions about the desirability of widescale and, in some instances, compulsory testing for the presence of the HIV virus. This will not be an easy exercise, nor will it be cheap. It will not be an exercise in which we will be able to avoid hysteria in some quarters and apathy in others. It will not be a debate in which we will manage to avoid some of the worst aspects of partisan politics, but at the same time it can be a debate in which we can draw upon the best aspects of bipartisan politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much welcome the publication of the report AIDS: a time to care, a time to act-Towards a strategy for Australians'. The Federal Opposition welcomes the publication of this discussion document. We now have to confront perhaps one of the most serious public health crisis ever to face this country. We must discharge our responsibilities not only as legislators, law makers and leaders of community opinion, but, indeed, as individual citizens and people of responsibility and, I hope, judgment and care. In order to do that I believe that this document should have the widest possible circulation and the widest possible debate. I congratulate those responsible for preparing the document and for publishing it. It is perhaps a signal event in Australian public policy that this document has been distributed today to every parliament of Australia, in upper and lower Houses of every State and the Commonwealth. I do not know that that has ever occurred before. I think it is an indication of the magnitude of the problem and of the seriousness with which Commonwealth and State governments and Ministers view the problem. They are prepared to turn their minds to doing something about this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I commenced my remarks by drawing attention to Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. It is to be hoped that, unlike the band on the Titanic, we are able to get everyone into the lifeboats and away securely and safely. To the extent that the Federal Opposition can play any role in facilitating that process, I can assure the Government that we will do so to our utmost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much of Senator Puplick's speech was devoted to detailing the seriousness of this question. Indeed, AIDS is a most serious public health problem. I might just set the record straight: Senator Puplick mentioned a figure of 1,079, but the actual figure involved, as indicated by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in his speech, is that, as of today, 22 November 1988, this country has suffered 1,100 cases of AIDS, and 538 of those people are dead. He went on to say that it is believed that between 15,000 and 25,000 people are infected by the virus. It is indeed a very major public health problem. The Minister also indicated in his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My prediction that AIDS would change our lives forever, challenging our deepest cultural, social and moral values has come true. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy discussion paper on AIDS needs to be critically examined by all national community leaders if AIDS is not to be used to undermine our deepest cultural, social and moral values. I believe that this discussion paper is at least two years late. In fact, during the past two or three years the Government's policy reaction to this most serious public health problem, by and large-but with some exceptions-has been determined behind closed doors, rather than publicly debated in this Parliament. I understand that there has been only one previous ministerial statement on this issue, with very little time made available for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves a major question of public policy. This is a matter that will affect everyone in one way or another. I do not say that Senator Puplick supported this suggestion, but he adverted to a suggestion in a book that some interest groups have substantially influenced public policy on this issue. Of course, that is the view not only of the person who wrote that book but also of the former head of the AIDS task force, Professor Pennington. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is high time for a discussion paper to be submitted to the Parliament so that members of parliament can discuss this question freely and openly. I understand that the response, in a parliamentary sense, to the policy discussion paper on AIDS will be left until next year. I understand that time will be made available by both the House of Representatives and the Senate for a full discussion on this paper when the Parliament meets early next year. As has been indicated, this is a public document and public responses are being sought. It is to be hoped that, as I indicated, there will be a critical but positive response to this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that the Minister has indicated in the statement that Australia has earned international acclaim for strategies to combat the virus which are viewed as exceptionally coherent, innovative and effective. The Minister said that after he had indicated that we had come to grips with the need for public discussion and advocacy of condoms for safer sex, the acknowledgment of bisexual as well as homosexual preferences in Australian society, and the distribution of free, clean needles and syringes to drug addicts. The Minister then went on to make the very important statement that we shall probably never know the quantitative extent of our success to date, although there is no doubt that some lives have been saved and some suffering avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that we cannot tell at this stage whether policies that have been adopted by the Government, particularly the education policies, will indeed have an effect. At present we cannot tell. So, it is very important that the public has an input, because we have got to get it right. Any policy which addresses, for example, the problem of sexually transmitted AIDS by promoting the use of condoms without warning against promiscuous behaviour, and which implies to young people that homosexual acts are just another way of life is, in fact, deceptive and will create the climate for the dramatic spread of AIDS in the future. It is deceptive, as we know, because of the failure rates of condoms. They are defective in the technical sense. The message or the inference coming across to young people that you can do what you like, when you like, how you like and with whom you like, provided you use a condom, is in fact creating a climate which will have devastating effects throughout the whole of the community and, indeed, will have devastating effects with the dramatic spread of AIDS in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A tragic example of how AIDS is being used to undermine our deepest cultural, social and moral norms is the proposal contained in the policy discussion paper on AIDS relating to abortion for pregnant HIV infected women. The proposal put forward in this document-and I have now had a chance to read it-is included without discussion of the grave moral, legal and scientific issues involved. </PARA>

<PARA> I know others wish to speak so I will conclude by saying that during the bubonic plague in England people from all walks of life, rich and poor, would have given anything to find a place safe from the plague. The disease AIDS could kill more people than did the bubonic plague, yet every single person in this country has the option of choosing a safe place. It must be recognised that, in this modern day and age, we cannot have the promotion of a promiscuous society without AIDS. We must get the answers to this problem right. I believe that it is very important for community leaders, and, indeed, all of the community, to respond. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Government wholeheartedly in its stand on the very difficult problem of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) as outlined in the excellent policy discussion paper before us. All Australians must face the fact that there may be no cure for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) this century. The problems associated with AIDS can be addressed positively now, but we must be prepared to carry the costs which the necessary course of action will inevitably entail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the most simplistic terms, we can think of our reaction to this problem in this way: Between the ages of four and seven most of us are taught to do one of the most dangerous things that we will ever do in our lives, that is, to cross the road safely on our own. Between the ages of 16 and 24 most of us are taught to use responsibly one of the most lethal machines known to society: the car. We must now undertake to teach all of our young people between the ages of perhaps 10 and 16 how to engage in sex safely. </PARA>
<PARA> All the challenges of the AIDS epidemic must be faced realistically and with compassion. However, there is no escaping the old wisdom that drastic problems require drastic solutions. The Government has identified three broad areas which must be addressed and discussed before a national AIDS strategy can be formulated. Broadly these areas are prevention or at least minimisation of the spread of the virus; support for and treatment of sufferers; and education, testing and prevention of the infection of carriers. In the area of prevention and minimisation, the Democrats believe that several steps should be taken immediately throughout the country. Some of these may appear at first to be rather radical, but they are all necessary in the crisis situation in which we now find ourselves. One of these steps is obviously easy access throughout the country to condoms and clean syringes. The Government is to be applauded for its efforts already taken in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that a pilot program should be approved immediately to provide the necessary injectables to addicted intravenous (IV) drug users who test HIV positive. This program should be carried out initially in Sydney, as this is the worst AIDS affected city of Australia's major population centres. IV drug users should be tested whenever possible. We also believe that all State governments should decriminalise prostitution so that all prostitutes can be registered and regularly tested for AIDS and all other sexually transmissible diseases. The difficult problem of Australia's prison system and the role of prisons as AIDS incubators is one which we must come to grips with as soon as possible. The solution will not be an easy one, as it must be acceptable to prison officers and to the majority of the occupants of the prison system. As with most problems associated with this difficult area, we must resolve the fine distinction between the basic human rights of the AIDS carrier and those of the people with whom the carrier comes into close contact. </PARA>
<PARA> Research into HIV identification procedures and into cures of the virus must receive huge increases in funding and must, of course, be encouraged at all levels. The current system of screening and testing blood donors in Australia is working extremely well and only needs refining as updated procedures become available. Our blood banks are to be congratulated on the prompt and effective steps they took at the first signs of the infection through blood donations. I believe we were the world leader in this field. The Democrats agree that support for infected people must be immediate, compassionate and thorough. We believe that funding must be provided for subsidised home care wherever possible, especially in the early stages of infection. More facilities should be established along the lines of the specialised ward at Sydney's Prince Henry Hospital. The establishment and design of this ward is a credit to the former Labor Government of New South Wales, and its continued existence is a credit to the current Liberal- National Party Government of that State. It has proved to be a very successful program and it should be extended to other sites as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDS education is a subject on which the Democrats have very strong views. We believe that adequate AIDS education should be mandatory in all Australian high schools and taught in the lower years before school attendance becomes optional. Education of the general public should continue along the very successful lines already established by the Government through television, radio and press advertising in both newspapers and magazines. The targeting of specific groups must be continued with educational material presented in a reader friendly form tailored to precise needs in such things as the very successful Streetwise comics, gay publications and materials distributed among IV drug users. This process must be broadened and accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also specified another target group, those who care for infected individuals. This is an area which has not been discussed previously in detail and one which must be addressed as soon as possible. The Australian Democrats applaud this government initiative. The policy discussion paper is well researched, well set out and obviously a sensitive, reasoned and intelligent approach to what is fast becoming the major health problem of the human race. We congratulate those who have contributed to the production of this excellent policy discussion document. I sincerely hope that this paper will have the widest possible circulation and will encourage discussion in all sections of Australian society, so that a co- hesive, comprehensive and positive strategy can be developed as soon as possible to combat this potentially devastating epidemic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the report tabled in the Parliament on 10 November on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, known as the Cross report. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I lodged a dissenting report to the recommendations put forward. I want to put on record my reasons for doing so. I want to make it clear that I agree with many of the recommendations of the report. I also want to make clear that my criticism should not be interpreted as a lack of understanding of, or concern for, the problems currently experienced by service families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was impressed by the goodwill and dedication of Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and their families in making their presentations to the Committee. I hope that if the report's recommendations are implemented some of those problems will be alleviated. However, I see a basic contradiction in the simultaneous calls for normalisation and uniqueness. On one hand, the Committee heard urgent pleas for the stresses on family life to be reduced. On the other hand, there was a reiteration of the special position of the ADF. Family life stresses could be reduced by meeting personal needs for security, stability and better self-image. However, these same problems are exacerbated by what the report refers to as the uniqueness of life within the ADF institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The very reasonable calls for family life to be more normal will remain unmet as long as ADF families move as frequently as they do at present. What families need is stability to be able to educate their children in fewer than half a dozen or so schools; to be able to buy a home, which is only worth doing if a placement is for more than a two-year period; and for spouses to be able to find permanent employment and to build long term relationships outside the nuclear family unit. All of these things are common problems with other sections of the work force, such as business people, bankers and teachers, who are on the move as well-although the degree of family disruption is greater within the Services. This situation will not improve while the constancy of placement changes is maintained at the present level. </PARA>
<PARA> The disruptions and, therefore, the resignations also will continue while the emphasis on remote locations continues, removing families from many of the amenities available in the urban situation of education, employment and entertainment. Dissatisfaction with displacement also will continue if the Royal Australian Navy is relocated from Sydney to Jervis Bay-a move which is not popular, I gather, with many Navy families. The dissatisfaction also will continue while there is a great deal of time spent away from home base on exercises, many of which I would argue are not necessary for Australia's defence but which are held in remote locations far from Australia's shores and which suit our allies' needs rather than our own defence needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissatisfaction also will continue as long as service life is glamourised by such grand events as military tattoos, naval reviews and air shows which attempt to glorify service life out of all proportion to the reality. For example, last week during the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide as well as all the noise and pollution from the racing cars there was the `added treat' for the public of Royal Australian Air Force planes doing their thing over Adelaide. It was a show of power and speed at great expense to the taxpayers, I might add, and also at great risk to the populace. I heard on good authority that the volunteer medical teams operating during the Grand Prix were told quite clearly that the greatest threat to the public was not from racing cars going out of control on the track, not from public stands collapsing, nor from fire, but from those planes on their demonstration flights across the city. An accident involving one of those planes on a display flight would have been disastrous. </PARA>

That kind of invited risk we can do without; as the West Germans have recently discovered to their great cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Young people often get the wrong idea about service life. This is often due to some of the advertising used by the Department of Defence to attract young people, for the wrong reasons. For example, I refer to the ad which was placed in the Australian Women's Weekly and various other magazines around the country headed `Navy Blues'. This has been criticised very rightly as being racist and sexist and has now been withdrawn. Senator Newman was among the critics of this particular advertisement which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Aussie sailors are experts on the local brews from Bangkok to San Diego and have a well deserved reputation for really knowing how to enjoy themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> After work they are just as likely to find themselves in some exotic new place and then it's on with the freshly laundered best blues and off with your mates to make a close study of the local wildlife. All work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy, but not in the Australian Navy. </PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement showed a very colourful picture of two or three women with sailors in tow, at very close quarters. The advertisement was also racist because the women very obviously were from countries other than our own. I am not going to get into an argument about Navy personnel or make judgments about whether in fact that is how the Navy behaves on leave, as portrayed in the advertisement. However, I think it is a disgrace that service life is promoted in that way. I am pleased to say that that advertisement has been withdrawn after community criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> Often life in the Services is very boring and very hierarchical. There are some quite nonsensical practices which are rigidly followed for no better reason than that they are traditional or that they impose discipline. For example, when I visited the Australian Defence Force Academy last year I was very amused to see personnel goosestepping around the quadrangles and in between the various buildings, not necessarily on parade or exercises. I could see no logical reason for that whatsoever. However, the advertisements for all branches of the Services generally show the he-man, action type of colour photographs with shots of male personnel all dressed up in their macho battle gear looking very aggressive. If that is what our service life is really like, I think that is a great shame. I believe that even people in the Services would agree that some of these advertisements are misleading, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> In other smaller countries such as Scandinavia and the Netherlands, work in the military is considered a normal vocation like any other job. It is not glamorised and service men and women fit into the community unobtrusively. Life would be a lot easier for service personnel and their families in Australia if we did not set the ADF so apart and if more emphasis were placed on the positive role of community services which the ADF actually provides within the community-for example, relief work during natural disasters such as fighting bushfires and assisting in flood situations. Obviously, this is a very positive role, which I do not think gets enough community emphasis, which would help the image of service people as part of the community instead of being set apart from the community. Another positive role which could be more emphasised is the peacekeeping role of the forces when they serve with the United Nations forces in various parts of the world. The United Nations Peacekeeping Force actually won the Nobel Peace Prize this year. These forces largely are unarmed and, in fact, see combat as a last resort. I think that this positive peacekeeping role should be emphasised rather than the macho image of men playing war games. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be worth while further developing some of the ideas put forward by Colonel Langtry in his submissions to the inquiry on an expanded role for the reserve which could result in a smaller Regular Army force. The days are gone when Australian Defence Force personnel and their families were prepared to be shunted around the country at the whim of the hierarchy. Their personal needs must be met. Lack of support from senior officers in dealing with family stress was referred to often in the submissions to the inquiry. I believe that this contributes to low morale. This is largely a consequence of the hierarchical nature of service life. </PARA>
<PARA> The input from the National Consultative Group of Service Spouses to the Committee was valuable. As a lobby group for more humane treatment and better conditions it is effective. However, its effectiveness is limited. For service personnel to be normalised within the wider community they need access to industrial action. Trade union activity would ensure that the conditions of workers were improved. After all, it is conditions of service that the high level of wastage is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> What the argument finally comes down to is dollars, as usual. If the Defence Department and the ADF want to maintain the alliance with the United States, if they want more and better equipment, which is highly expensive, and also better conditions for personnel, they are going to have to squeeze a lot more than around the 2 1/2 per cent of the gross domestic product and just under 10 per cent from Budget allocation out of government coffers. Defence expenditure has traditionally been at a figure less than 3 per cent of GDP in peacetime Australia. Will the Department of Defence and the ADF be able to convince the Australian public that they should be spending more on defence to satisfy both hardware and personnel demands? I think not. I certainly would be against that as I think that our defence dollars could be better spent. This was not the subject of the inquiry but because that wider aspect of defence policy was not addressed this report will probably not totally satisfy anyone. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>By Rod Campbell</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A leading firm of chartered accountants has identified numerous breaches of company law and government grant conditions, and uncovered long-standing poor accounting methods, in its investigation into the financial affairs of the Charleville Aboriginal Housing Company. </PARA>
<PARA> The company, which is now in the hands of a receiver/manager after defaulting on a $148,000 loan, was set up in 1977 to provide housing and other accommodation for Aboriginal people in the Warrego region of western Queensland. Its government funding-through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission-ceased in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> As reported in The Canberra Times yesterday, the accountants, Ernst and Whinney, reported a number of major areas in which the company's financial management practices were deficient. These included accountability for assets, control over and recording of income, and authorisation for payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The report identified a number of breaches of the Queensland Company Code, the company's articles of association and the terms of government grant agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It also reported on substantial unbanked money, irregularities in payments, the granting of retrospective loans to directors of the company and the purchase by the company of property from directors, including the chairman, Ray Robinson. Mr Robinson is also chairman of the Queensland Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>
<PARA> More detailed findings on some of those matters are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> During November 1987, the company purchased two vacant lots from Mr Robinson for $17,000, a house and land from Mr Robinson and his wife for $58,000, and a house and land from Mr Gregory Davidson and his wife for $48,000. Mr Davidson is a member of the company's committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants noted that Mr Robinson had purchased ``certain properties'' and sold them to the company ``at a substantial profit''. In turn, Mr Robinson said the price paid by the company had been supported by independent valuations. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants said a property purchased by Mr Robinson in March 1985 for $32,000 had been sold to the company six months later for $44,000. </PARA>
<PARA> They had access to two independent valuations on each of the properties purchased in November 1987. One had been prepared by A. J. Hamilton, of Charleville, and the other by J. E. Liley, of Toowoomba. Mr Hamilton had valued Mr Robinson's vacant lots at $16,000 in July, 1986, while Mr Liley had valued them at $8000 in November 1987. The company had purchased the lots for $17,000 that same month. Mr Hamilton had valued the Robinson house and land at $54,032 in October 1986, while Mr Liley had valued it at $37,000 13 months later. It had been purchased for $58,000. Finally, Mr Hamilton had valued the Davidson property at about $46,000 and Mr Liley, a month later, at $28,500. It had sold for $48,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants found that a number of payments made by the company required further audit investigation before conclusions could be drawn about their propriety. These included a large number of payments to the ``CEP Market Garden'', certain payments noted as ``to be reimbursed'' by various individuals and organisations, a $2500 cash payment noted as being for ``Liquidator NAC Furniture'', several travel-allowance payments to Mr Robinson, and $5000 paid to a firm for legal fees and ``consultation and negotiation'' of a $20,000 loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants had not been provided with any material concerning the CEP Market Garden account and could not investigate the payments made to it. While the practice of making such payments had not been unusual or uncommon between related entities, it was important that good quality accounting records be maintained to monitor reimbursements. There was no evidence that these had been maintained, they said. </PARA>
<PARA> The only documentation, other than a payment voucher, concerning the $2500 had been in a letter from the company administrator, Ken Munro, to the Aboriginal Development Corporation, to the effect that the money had been paid to the liquidator of the NAC for the purchase of the furniture being used in the community centre by ``the ex-NAC member and chairman of the company''. Mr Robinson, the chairman, had confirmed this. </PARA>
<PARA> A $5000 cheque had been paid to a company called Pelargic Pty Ltd, although this should have read Pelagic. The only supporting documentation had been a payment voucher. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robinson had said that the firm was a financial broker and had arranged meetings for Mr Robinson with Mercantile Credits to obtain a $148,000 loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants could not contact anyone at Pelagic to discover the nature of the services provided. They wondered whether the reference to a $20,000 loan was related to the $148,000 or to something else. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants said 128 cheques had been issued from the company's general account in the year ended June 30, 1987. Vouchers had been issued for 122 of these, 58 of which had been unauthorised. During that period, 48 cheques drawn on the community-worker account had been issued, 19 without authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants said a $6500 loan to Mr Robinson had been noted in the company's 1986 financial statement. Other transactions were also noted. These included payments from Mr Robinson totalling $6870 and payments to him of $1200. The accountants concluded that if all the transactions related to loans, Mr Robinson still owed the company $830. </PARA>
<PARA> A company cheque for $150 had been paid to a Charleville publican in relation to a cheque cashed at a hotel by Martin Ebsworth, a company director. Mr Ebsworth had apparently repaid $100 of this. Another cheque, for $1000, had been paid to Mr Robinson and noted as ``advance of wage''. The word ``advance'' had been crossed out and ``loan'' written underneath. This had been repaid over several weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> With one minor exception, government grants to the company ceased in 1986. However, the accountants noted numerous breaches of grant conditions before this. </PARA>
<PARA> It said the company's purchase of properties late last year with money borrowed from Mercantile Credits could represent the borrowing of money in anticipation of a grant, contrary to ADC rules. Also contrary to ADC rules had been the unauthorised loans to directors, some of which came from grant money.</PARA>
<PARA> Assets acquired with grant money costing more than $500 had to be recorded in an asset register but no such register had been kept. Although ADC and departmental rules required assets to be safeguarded against loss or damage, one company house had not been insured and several had not been kept in a good state of repair. </PARA>
<PARA> In December, 1987, the company had mortgaged eight properties as security for the $148,000 loan without obtaining prior approval from the department or ADC. Unexpended grant money from 1985 and 1986 did not appear to have been satisfactorily acquitted. </PARA>
<PARA>Auditors slam Aboriginal company</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>By Rod Campbell</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An Aboriginal housing company in Queensland, now in the hands of a receiver and manager, made unauthorised loans to its directors, engaged in a number of questionable transactions and had poor control over assets and income, a leading firm of chartered accountants has found. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the company, the Charleville Aboriginal Housing Company Ltd, is Ray Robinson, also chairman of the Queensland Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robinson has been a vocal critic of the Aboriginal Development Commission and in September, at a meeting in Queensland, moved a vote of no confidence against two senior ADC officers over their handling of a $300,000 loan to an Aboriginal group in NSW to purchase a Kangaroo works. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robinson was one of two of the Charleville company's directors who sold property to the company based on 12-month-old valuations and, in Mr Robinson's case, at a substantial profit. The accountants, Ernst and Whinney, said substantially lower valuations had been prepared by another valuer but it could not draw any conclusions on the conflicting valuations. </PARA>
<PARA> To finance these purchases, and to pay outstanding debts following the cessation of government funding, the company had borrowed $148,000 from Mercantile Credits but had failed to meet the monthly repayments. As a result, Mercantile Credits had appointed receivers and managers to the company in April. Ernst and Whinney concluded that the company was unlikely to be able to repay the loan or service the interest on the debt without the resumption of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants' report was sent to the Queensland regional office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in June. The department had commissioned the report earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed, audit work began in March after a large volume of company books, records and vouchers, which had been seized by Queensland Fraud Squad detectives, had been forwarded to Ernst and Whinney. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants said that during November, 1987, the company had spent $123,000 to purchase three properties from directors of the company and their families. The purchase prices had been based on valuations, some more than a year old, which valued the three properties at $116,000. Another valuer, whose valuations were done at about the time of the sales, put a total valuation of $73,500 on them. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We are unable to draw any conclusions as to the differences between the two valuations,'' the accountants said. </PARA>
<PARA> They found that the company's tenants owed it more than $35,000 in outstanding rent. On the other hand, it owed the Murweh Shire Council nearly $20,000 for rates, about $3700 to another firm of auditors and apparently owed Mr Robinson several weeks wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountants concluded that the company's directors and management were ``not skilled in accounting procedures or financial management'' and appeared to have ``limited knowledge of legal requirements for a public company'' incorporated in Queensland. Accountability for assets was poor, control over, and recording of, income from tenants was deficient and the authorisation and documentary support for payments was inadequate. A number of breaches of the requirements of the company's articles and the Queensland Company Code in relation to meetings and recording minutes had been noted. </PARA>
<PARA> The auditors said there had been a number of payments that required further audit investigation ``before conclusions could be drawn regarding their propriety''. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments were generally well supported by internally generated payment vouchers, although a large number of these bore no authorising signature. A significant number of payments were not supported by invoices or documentation that might provide evidence that the goods and services had been received. It was, the report said, very difficult to draw any specific conclusions about the reasonableness of many of the payments. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Certain questionable transactions were identified and an explanation for them obtained from the directors,'' it said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In addition, various unauthorised loans to directors were made. While the majority of such loans have now been repaid, and certain of the loans were given retrospective approval by the directors, the practice of making such loans constitutes a breach of the code and represent a serious internal control risk, particularly given the company's unreliable accounting systems''. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the company's management had failed to conduct its affairs in a ``proper and accountable manner'', the accountants said. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Opposition has been asking about the administration of Aboriginal funding in the Charleville area because many allegations have been made to us, including that there has been a cover-up because of the friendship of the senior people in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) with Mr Ray Robinson, the Aboriginal boss in Charleville. During the proceedings of Estimates Committee E Senator Short asked whether a copy of the auditor's report could be provided. The reply, given on behalf of the Minister, Mr Hand, was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Special Audit of the Charleville Aboriginal Housing Company was completed in June 1988 and has been under consideration given that time by the Queensland Police and the Queensland Corporate Affairs Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Until these investigations are completely finalised it is not considered appropriate to release the Audit document. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriate or not, the report is obviously out and about. Therefore, I seriously challenge the Ministry, Mr Hand and Senator Tate to table the Ernst and Whinney audit report that has now been referred to so publicly in the Canberra Times articles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that on 2 September Mr Robinson and two others were brought to Canberra at DAA expense to give evidence to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which was considering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill. Its evidence was in favour of ATSIC. We have now referred one aspect of that matter to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. In the course of his evidence, Mr Sugar Ray Robinson was asked repeatedly about the special audit. This was on 2 September. Again and again he asserted that the audit had proved all allegations against him to be untrue. He said, `That matter is cleared up.' That was in the transcript. That was in September, only two months ago. Yet the Minister's response to Senator Short's request to make the auditor's report available to him was that it had been with him since June. Far from having cleared things up, there are now supposed to be two investigations under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The kindest interpretation one can put on Mr Robinson's evidence is that he has been seriously misinformed. I have regretfully come to the view that that is inconceivable. He must surely have taken the closest interest in the progress of the matter. I consider that he knew very well that he was under a cloud. In saying what he did he lied to a committee of the Senate when giving evidence before it. Considering all the people he knew in Aboriginal Affairs, is it really credible that between June and September no word reached him from his many contacts, including his fellow member of the DAA Sports Advisory Committee, Mr Perkins, about his predicament? The better view has to be that he knew very well that the matter was still under investigation. He was not, as it was reportedly said, cleared. It suited his purpose and the purpose of the Minister, who had him flown to Canberra at public expense to speak in support of the Minister's legislation and to tell senators a different story. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not heard a word from the Minister, Mr Hand, after the transcript of evidence of 2 September appeared. Opposition senators have had to drag the information out of the Minister about Mr Robinson and the murky affairs of the Charleville Aboriginal Housing Co. Why did the Minister not make a correction to the evidence when he saw it? Is this whole episode yet another case where Minister Hand was not involved? Was the bringing of Mr Robinson and others to Canberra yet another serious and significant event in Aboriginal Affairs about which the Minister knew nothing? Did he just turn a blind eye? Was it a case of the left hand not knowing what the other was doing, if honourable senators would pardon the pun? A curious passage in those Senate committee proceedings of 2 September occurred when Senator Coulter asked Mr Robinson:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand the audit was held up while the Ombudsman's investigation into the ADC was proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to a complaint Mr Robinson had made to the Ombudsman earlier in the year. Mr Robinson replied, `That is not correct'. What is the truth of this matter? Did the Minister, Mr Hand, make some sort of deal with Mr Robinson last year to delay the appointment of an auditor? As a result of Mr Hand's direction was the commencement of the audit delayed for over five months until March 1988? The Opposition has heard allegations that there was a delay last year. Did this delay afford the company time in which to borrow $148,000 from Mercantile Credits Ltd, a sum which the company must have known it had no chance of repaying out of its own resources and against which it offered its Commonwealth funded housing stock as security without seeking or obtaining consent to do so? Is it a fact that those moneys were borrowed to permit the purchase of property from Mr Robinson and his fellow company director, Mr Davidson, at a price over 60 per cent above the valuations then current? Is it a fact that $28,000 of this money is still not accounted for?</PARA>
<PARA> The gullibility of the Minister, Mr Hand, in accepting various points of view, particularly from someone such as Mr Robinson with such a bad track record over 15 to 20 years, must be seriously questioned. I therefore ask the Minister to table the facts of this allegation. The quid pro quo for the Minister was getting Mr Robinson's support for ATSIC, something Mr Robinson delivered in evidence, albeit flawed evidence, before the Senate Select Committee and at an Aboriginal community committee in Rockhampton on 15 and 16 September when he tried unsuccessfully three times to get a motion supporting ATSIC adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not just talking about anyone. By his own account given to the Senate Select Committee on 2 September, Mr Robinson holds a number of key positions in Aboriginal Affairs. He has stated in evidence that he holds the following positions: Chairman of the QEB Legal Service; Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service for the whole of Queensland; Chairman of the Charleville Aboriginal Housing Co.; a member of the QEB Sporting Foundation; Treasurer of the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat-that is, the national legal service coordinating body; and an executive member of the National Sporting Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It was apparent from evidence to the Estimates Committee that the Sporting Council included various mates of Charles Perkins. No-one elected them; they just got appointed by the former Secretary to the Department. Among them were Sugar Ray Robinson and Phillip Hall, two people with nasty criminal records. We are asked to believe that the Minister knew nothing of this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr President. I have sat patiently through this speech. Senator Tambling has made an allegation that a person lied to a Senate committee. He has made an allegation that the same person presented `flawed evidence' to a Senate committee. I have listened in vain for him to substantiate those allegations, but he has gone on to ask a series of questions which do not amount to a substantiation. The forum of the Senate is not available to malign people. An accusation that someone has lied is an accusation that, at best-if it is to be persisted with-should be supported with some evidence to justify it, otherwise the chamber can be ill-used to victimise individuals. More importantly, if Senator Tambling believes what he is saying, there is an obligation on him to inform the Senate why he has not taken action to refer it to the Privileges committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

If any of the people who have been named wish to refer the matter to me, they can do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised about this, given the fact that we have called repeatedly for these audit reports and various other information to be tabled. I believe that most of the issues I have raised can be substantiated in the various Hansards of Senate select committees, Senate Estimates committees and the Senate. If Mr Robinson's record of converting Aboriginal moneys to his own use is half as good as evidenced in the auditors' report on just one of these organisations, we ought to be very worried about what may be happening in all of the others I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister ought to be worried now, even if he apparently was not before. He should tell us what he has done. We were told in the Estimates Committee that Mr Robinson has serious criminal charges hanging over him. We see, if the Canberra Times account is anywhere near correct, a man who has played fast and loose with the very homes in which the Aboriginal people of Charleville live and with the public money provided for that purpose. Yet he continues to hold office, and very influential office, in a whole range of organisations. How many of them are funded by DAA? He is even treasurer of the national body dealing with Aboriginal legal aid. The Minister, Mr Hand, has done nothing. He has continued to fund and support these various bodies. Perhaps this whole affair is something else that no-one told him about. How can he be satisfied to provide grant moneys to any of the organisations associated with Mr Robinson? No doubt he will tell us that the principle of self-determination must be observed and that the Auditor-General, Mr Menzies or someone else will find out the truth one of these days. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about public funds made available to assist Aboriginal people in need. Yet the Minister, Mr Hand, complacently sits by while there is a most serious risk of even more funds being creamed off. Already it seems that $150,000 had just disappeared and the people whose houses were mortgaged over their heads risk eviction. How much more proof does this Minister need? It is simply not good enough to say that this matter will be looked at by the Auditor-General and nothing will be hidden. In fact, the matter has been kept hidden for far too long already and there is at least a suspicion that there was a deal to keep it so. At a time when the Government apparently still thinks that the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is a valid way for the future management of Aboriginal affairs, the Minister, Mr Hand, scandalously neglects his clear duty to discipline the most blatant case of abuse so far uncovered by the Opposition. I say `uncovered': had we not asked questions in this place and persisted until some believable replies were given, this matter would have remained hidden. Mr Robinson would have been standing for election as a commissioner for ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> When will the Government do something to stop this kind of blatant misappropriation? The reality is that Mr Hand is so obsessed with his vision of a new world through ATSIC that he can see no harm in a few rorts, especially when those getting the benefits extend their political support to his dream of the future. When will Labor senators opposite wake up?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in the habit of regularly circulating to a number of members of the Australian Defence Force material on defence matters which have been discussed in this chamber. In the past I have not chosen to circulate the naive and dangerous unilateral disarmament nonsense which we receive regularly from Senator Vallentine. However, I intend to make an exception with her speech tonight because I think all members of the Defence Force should see just what dreadful drivel we have been subjected to in this place by the senator from Western Australia who should be ashamed of the language she has used tonight about our service men and women. I am sure that all honourable senators would condemn her for her attitude. I thought it was quite disgraceful. I hope that other senators share my concern. I believe that Australian service men and women should know of the total lack of support that they would receive at the hands of Senator Vallentine. But at least we are comforted by knowing that there is no chance that she and her like will ever get a chance to form a government in this country. God help Australia if that ever became an eventuality. For all its faults, at least the Labor Government has sufficient members who are prepared to support a defence force, even though two of its Ministers, in my opinion, have failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine talked about glorifying the Defence Force. I imagine that she puts me in the class of those who do glorify the Defence Force. She does not believe that there should be any special help for servicemen and their families and she talks of Sweden. When she talks of little Sweden with its closely built-up areas and ease of communication and access for most of the inhabited areas, let me remind her of the vastness of our remote country and the difficult and lonely places to which our servicemen may be sent, with or without their families. Let me remind her of the 15 men sent to the Middle East whom our Government has forgotten, the men who are part of the force sent by the United Nations to the Iraq-Iran border. The force of which those men are a part has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. One would have expected Senator Vallentine at least to be prepared to give recognition to the noble work that they are doing in the cause of peace. But no, we get none of that from Senator Vallentine. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell Senator Vallentine how on Tuesday and Wednesday of one week they were ordered to go and by the Sunday they were on their way. Let me ask her just what that would do to a family-with the father being suddenly uprooted from his children and the mother left grieving. There is no other word for it; `grieving' is not too extreme. There is a sense of grief in those circumstances. But wives say to their husbands, `You are a soldier: you must go'. A wife of one of those 15 has a 2 1/2-year-old child and an eight-month-old baby. She has been left on her own. Senator Vallentine does not seem to think that she is worthy of any special care and attention because her husband is a serviceman. She says that those people are not unique and do not fulfil a special place in the life of our country. I deny that utterly. </PARA>
<PARA> Those men have been away from Australia for nearly four months and still the Government has not paid them their allowances. I drew the Senate's attention to that in Question Time today. Once again, Senator Richardson was not able to answer my questions. However, my questions demonstrate clearly that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) has neglected those men and has not been able or willing to push the bureaucrats along to see that those allowances are paid. If those men are very lucky they might get their allowances by the time they return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also went on with some nonsense about cadets goosestepping around at the Australian Defence Force Academy. If she knew as much about defence as she pretends to know, she would realise that Australian servicemen do not goosestep. It was a disgraceful exaggeration. She talked of the glamour of the naval review and military tattoos, et cetera. She should realise very well that this is glamour at a price. The cuts which were made by the Government this year in the day to day operating costs of the defence forces will mean that these activities have been undertaken, at the wish of the Government, at the price of the security of the nation. Senator Vallentine reveals by this criticism that she cannot bear to see the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have been turning out to see their Defence Force. One of the major spin-offs, in my opinion, of having these reviews from time to time is that it gives ordinary Australians a chance to see their defence forces at work. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australians are proud of their forces. They do not talk about them much. They are not the subject of letters to the newspapers and journalists do not write about them very much. I think Australians on the whole do not even think about them very much, although they like to feel that they are there. They do not want to feel worried about them, but at the first signs of problems in the region or in times of national emergency, such as Ash Wednesday or the Darwin cyclone, Australians turn to their defence forces for help. These are not special people in the defence forces. They are ordinary men and women, but they are doing difficult jobs for us and they are a unique breed in that regard. I am proud of them and I urge this nation and this Government to show that pride to our defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I utterly condemn Senator Vallentine for her cynical and disgraceful comments about our forces. On the other hand, I enthusiastically congratulate Mr Manfred Cross and the other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiring into wastage rates because they have brought down an excellent report which the Government will ignore at its peril. Frankly, if I had any chance to do anything about it, so long as we had a Labor government in Canberra I would have Manfred Cross as the Minister for Defence. He, of all the members of this Government, knows enough about the subject to see that defence personnel are treated properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite know how they become aware of the fact that they have been defamed when the proceedings are not being broadcast but, nonetheless, I will report Senator Tambling's defamation to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). It should be said that if Senator Tambling wishes to make the wild accusations he has, if he has any self-respect, he ought, at least, to adduce some evidence to justify the accusations that he makes so that at least they can have some credible foundation, whether the foundation be true or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling asked a number of questions which raise inferences but do not actually provide any foundational base to make an accusation. That is a well-known ploy in debate. Where it involves an individual's reputation and he has little come-back, I think it is absolutely lamentable. I have no idea whether the individual concerned is guilty of the things that Senator Tambling accuses him of. I do know that if, to quote Senator Tambling, `serious criminal charges are hanging over his head', then he is entitled and will remain entitled-as long as I am a senator in this country and hopefully as long as we have this institution in place-to a presumption of innocence until he is proven guilty, and that he should not be attacked on the basis of an assumption of guilt until he is proven innocent. Yet that was the strong implication that Senator Tambling made. I think it is an example of what we sometimes lament as a misuse of this forum and is one of the reasons why sometimes commentators regard politicians with low esteem. I think that it is entirely regrettable. I think that Senator Tambling should retract some of his comments, if not now, at some other time. I just want to record my reaction to that speech. </PARA>
