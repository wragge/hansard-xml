<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations believe that the claim for a 7.5 per cent increase in award wages being pursued by the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia (BWIU) represents an acceptable increase in labour costs? Is the Government satisfied that this is not a case of using union muscle, or industrial muscle, to pressure employers in the field to obtain wage increases beyond the capacity of the economy to pay? I ask whether the Minister agrees with the following statement by Mr Tom McDonald, the National Secretary of the BWIU:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the current system expires in May, unions will be free to make claims [as] there won't be any guidelines.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and other bodies will decide in May about future wage fixation procedures. Mr McDonald is entitled to his view. I cannot comment on it really, except to say that we will have to wait and see what the Commission, having received submissions from a variety of sources, determines about the future conduct of wage negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the BWIU claim, I do not know whether it is a question of using industrial muscle to obtain particular results. I would have thought that the notion that these matters can be left to corporations and employees to decide was very much inherent in the philosophy of the Liberal Party in relation to wage fixation procedures. For example, the second tier negotiations involved some level of industrial disputation which was higher than that which previously existed because it forced the parties into negotiations amongst themselves during which the proposed weapons were used on both sides. In so far as a claim has been made for a 7.5 per cent increase in award wages in the building industry, I have no particular knowledge of the circumstances of the building industry, but I think that that would be a claim which the Government would not willingly invite employers to accede to.</PARA>

I ask: Bearing in mind that he has indicated that he does not know what the Commission will decide in May, which is a very fair response, is the Government proposing that there should be an open go with respect to negotiations post-May, or does the Government have another approach in mind?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I refer the Minister to a recent Press report in the Melbourne Herald of 15 April 1988 that there are significant deposits of uranium at Coronation Hill. Can the Minister inform the Senate of the accuracy of these claims and whether the joint venturers deliberately omitted reference to uranium mineralisation in their preliminary environmental impact statement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1683" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of reports that suggest that uranium has been found at Coronation Hill. However, I am not aware that there is any basis to them, nor is anyone in my Department. In fact, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) personnel have informed us in the last few weeks that, despite intensive exploration at the site, they have been unable to find any uranium deposits. Even if there are no deposits suitable for mining at the moment, obviously there must be some trace of uranium there, given that it was certainly an operating uranium mine in the 1950s. There is ample evidence of that for anyone who visits the site, so I am sure there must be some uranium there. As far as BHP is concerned, it is not in a mineable quantity. As far as I am concerned, it does not pose any problem for us at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department, in discussions concerning the guidelines for the environmental impact statement which is being prepared for the project, has asked BHP to ensure that any potential radiological hazards are addressed fully. I should add that the exploration authority which was recently given to BHP Gold Pty Ltd for the purposes of Coronation Hill specifically excluded exploration for uranium. I assure Senator Collins and the Senate that, in line with current Australian Labor Party policy, there will be no mining of uranium at Coronation Hill.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ND4">Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories aware that in a Press release last month the Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Gary Punch, reaffirmed the Government's generous resettlement scheme for Christmas Island workers who had been made redundant-namely, $9,000 per redundant worker in addition to the redundancy package, which averages $40,000? In light of the offer to the Christmas Island workers, will the Minister agree that the offer of financial assistance of $2,500 to the workers displaced because of the rainforest listing in far north Queensland is a very paltry amount? Can the Minister give any information about further redundancy payments to north Queensland workers so that they will not feel that this Government has discriminated against them?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1683" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bjelke- Petersen should look a little more carefully at the package that I announced for north Queensland last Friday. The sum of $2,500 was the main element of the interim package announced last December, but it is far from the main element of the package that I announced a couple of days ago. The Government was concerned to ensure that in that package it delivered on its promise of jobs, and so it made jobs the hallmark. The $2,500 is, of course, included, but that is by no means the only prospect for workers displaced in north Queensland. As an example, specifically included in that package is provision for workers aged 55 and over to receive up to $30,000 as a redundancy package. So the Government has looked at adjustment assistance for workers, including retraining and relocation allowances, et cetera, as well as at providing a substantial number of jobs. On top of that, it will provide payments where workers find themselves in difficulty. I would have thought all of that added up to a complete package and that therefore no-one in north Queensland would find himself worse off than a Christmas Island worker. Mind you, had we all lived and worked on Christmas Island for the last few years we would all be doing pretty well because the rates Christmas Island workers have been looking at and the subsidies they have received in the last decade place them well in front of the average Australian worker.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security seen recent Press articles questioning the adequacy of the family allowance supplement (FAS)? Can the Minister explain whether the family allowance supplement represents the limit of the Government's attack on child poverty?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1684" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have indeed seen recent articles reporting concerns of welfare groups about the Government's commitment to alleviating child poverty. These articles have emanated most recently from Queensland. We should not be surprised that these sorts of reports are coming out of Queensland, because of the low level of State funding and concessions in education, transport and housing provided in that State. The people there would obviously feel the effects of not having those services provided. The answer to Senator Coates's question is that the family allowance supplement is not the limit of the Government's attack on child poverty. It can be called a crucial centrepiece of our attack, but it is very much a part of a broader commitment. That broader commitment was spelt out quite recently by the Prime Minister at a child poverty conference in Melbourne, where he said that our attack on child poverty must include three issues-job creation, the cost of housing, and reform of education and training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought it would be better for Senator Stone to stay quiet for as long as possible these days. I repeat that the Government commitment involves a broad approach, and that broad approach, despite the cynicism expressed by spokespeople such as Senator Stone, has since 1983 delivered one million new jobs, allocated $5.3 billion to public housing and provided 110,000 approved child care places. The Government's commitment to its attack on child poverty is a strong one, and it should be noted in this context that our family allowance supplement is now being paid to over 115,000 working families. Over and above that-Senator Vanstone is coming in to gain some education-increased child care payments are now being paid to 412,000 pensioner and beneficiary families. I should also make mention of the fact, especially in respect of the second part of our commitment, that increased rent assistance of $15 a week is also payable under FAS. If I am to be greeted with some sort of cynicism from, amongst other senators, Senator Vanstone, I should refer both Senator Vanstone and Senator Haines--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The achievement of the benchmarks-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this context I should also refer to the actual rate of payments. The Government's commitment is to raise the level of payments from 11.1 per cent of the married rate pension, which it was when we inherited it in 1983, to at least 15 per cent for children under the age of 13 and 20 per cent for older children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the interjections that I am getting from Senator Michael Baume, I should refer those opposite to the sort of record that their Government was responsible for up to 1983 when Senator Chaney was Minister for Social Security. We should remind them of the fact that over 200,000 adults and children were thrown into poverty, onto the unemployment heap; child payments fell from 15.2 per cent of the married rate of pension in 1977 to 11.1 per cent in 1983; and pensions were cut in real terms by 2.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The direct answer to Senator Coates's question and to the criticisms in the Queensland Press is that the Government's commitment to child poverty is not solely family allowance supplement based; it is a much broader commitment and it is one on which we are achieving much progress.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and relates to the views expressed by Clive Hamilton, a member of the Bureau of Industry Economics, and quoted extensively in an article in the Age earlier this month in what Kenneth Davidson described as a recent valuable and original paper on micro-economic and macro-economic effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar. Mr Hamilton said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our foreign debt . . . arose because of an excess of spending on imports due to incomes inflated by foreign borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA> The debt caused the deficit rather than the deficit caused the debt. The cure can thus at best be only partially obtained by depreciations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone is unscarred, as he points out-from both governments. The first Government was probably scared of him and the second Government probably should have taken the first Government's example of what it did with other bureaucrats. I think the important point in the answer is that we have to reduce foreign borrowings. For that reason, the Government has set about the task of reducing the domestic deficit and getting the Budget into surplus, which will increase our capacity to reduce foreign borrowings at government level. I suppose that is the simple explanation of what the Government is about in terms of the attack which it has made on outlays in government expenditure, reducing the public sector borrowing requirement and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the controversy raging in the United Kingdom over the use of aborted foetuses as brain transplant donors? Is it not a fact that the transplant procedure requires that the foetus be delivered alive and then decapitated so that the brain tissue is fresh and intact? Has the Minister noted today's statement by Dr Helga Kuhse supporting this procedure, and adding that in exceptional circumstances it might be acceptable for a woman deliberately to become pregnant and have an abortion to save another person's life? Is this the Dr Helga Kuhse who, with Dr Peter Singer, has been given $450,000 of medical research funds by Dr Blewett for a project entitled `Bioethical Issues in the Use of Human Foetal Tissue, Embryos and Gametes'? Will the Minister issue a statement condemning this uncivilised brain transplant procedure and take steps to ensure that it will be banned in Australia, as it is in the United States of America, or are we to assume, in the absence of any such condemnation, that the Government's policy is where its money is going?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my response to the question I will tell Senator Richardson what is a safe level of alcohol consumption. I am aware of the reports in the weekend Press, and I am also aware of a report in Monday's West Australian about a survey that the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health has released about national dietary habits. It was a survey that had been retaken for the first time in 40 years and was thus able to provide a check in the changeover time of dietary habits of Australians. That survey, which was concluded in 1983, covered 6,255 people aged between 25 and 64 years who were living in State capitals. Because of that, it excluded those living in provincial centres, but the general evidence of the Department of Community Services and Health indicates that the alcohol consumption of people who live in provincial centres in certain circumstances is more of a danger and a more serious problem for younger age groups than is necessarily the case in capital cities. So the survey does not take into account that which, I guess, is another worrying feature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey found that one in 10 Australian males has a daily alcohol consumption of 75 per cent above the safe level and that one in 10 Australian women consumes 50 per cent above the safe daily level, which means that men consume more than 40 grams of alcohol per day on average and women 20 grams of alcohol per day on average. The safe level for men is four standard measures of beer, table wine, fortified wine or spirits per day, whereas the standard measure for women is half that amount-two standard measures per day.</PARA>
<PARA> The consumption of alcohol is not the only factor affecting health standards in this country. Australians, of course, have a propensity to eat fattier foods, at a level much higher than one would wish to encourage. I note on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, that in the primary industry area this matter is being addressed by the lean beef campaign and a number of other campaigns involving primary producers, to try to make red meat in particular more attractive for the dietary conscious.</PARA>
<PARA> To answer the other part of the question asked by Senator Devereux, a number of States around Australia are running anti-alcohol campaigns. In my own State of Western Australia there is a television campaign called the Drink Safe Campaign. As well, the Australian Hotels Association in the State is running a campaign to discourage underage drinking in Western Australia. The Federal Government, in association with the States, is also running a television campaign on drinking which is aimed in particular at cutting down the incidence of binge drinking among teenagers in the age group of 12 to 14 years, at increasing parents understanding of alcoholism in youth, thus enabling them to counsel and advise in this area, and at encouraging parents to set themselves up as model examples so that younger children and early teenage children do not follow bad examples that might be set in the home.</PARA>
<PARA> The campaign is supported by all the States and I commend it to the Senate and to the Australian community as a means of educating this country to be more socially responsible in the use of alcohol. It is not a wowser campaign aimed at stopping alcohol consumption but it does preach the very strong message that it is a public campaign aimed at bringing responsibility to consumption.</PARA>

As the earlier refusal was based on the alleged effect on Australia's even-handed position regarding the Iran-Iraq war, is the Government now prepared to follow the example of the United Kingdom, which has put humanitarian reasons before such political concerns? In light of the Government's highly commendable work on a chemical warfare ban at the international level and also in respect of the answer given to Senator Wood last week, how can Australia maintain its commitment in this area when public servants with expertise in this field have been moved on from the peace, disarmament and arms control branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade without being replaced by staff at the same level?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia declined an Iranian request to receive chemical warfare victims in Australia on the basis that they could be better treated closer to Iran and that Australian hospitals had limited capacity, and that remains the Government's approach. Our humanitarian concerns on this matter and similar matters are effectively pursued, we believe, by other means. On 14 April Mr Duffy announced that Australia would contribute $100,000 to an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) appeal for the victims of the Iran-Iraq war and some of the funds would be used by the ICRC to assist victims of the chemical attacks on Halabja. Australia also contributed $70,000 in 1984 to the previous ICRC appeal for victims of the war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the last part of Senator Vallentine's question, as I explained to Senator Wood last week, the Government continues to allocate a very high priority and a considerable number of staff to the pursuit of Australia's arms control and disarmament objectives. There is no question that adequate resources and expertise do still exist in the peace, arms control and disarmament branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that Australia continues to play a positive and active role in efforts towards the achievement of a chemical weapons convention. As to Senator Vallentine's momentous revelation that some staff changes have occurred, she should recognise that in a department which manages the country's foreign service, rotation of staff between different policy areas and posts is unavoidable and, provided it is properly managed, highly desirable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be inclined to take more seriously a communications policy question from Senator Messner and the Opposition if the Opposition could show any signs of getting its own communications policy act together. I understand that for the umpteenth week in a row there has been deferral of consideration of a whole variety of matters. That is perfectly understandable when one understands the hotchpotch of issues that are flowing around in the Tory breast on this issue at the moment and when one has regard to the manifest lack of understanding of the technical issues involved that are embodied in questions of the kind I have just received from Senator Messner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic situation so far as pay television is concerned is spelt out in detail in the Press release I have issued today, which explains the technological and legal realities of the situation. A statutory moratorium exists until the latter part of 1990. We have set in train a review process now to enable ourselves to have a clearly formulated and articulated policy in place well in advance of the expiry of that statutory moratorium so that in the event that a decision is made to proceed with some form of subscription or pay television it can be put in place immediately after the expiry of the moratorium, although not necessarily as late as 1991 or 1992. We will be hoping for a lead time of at least a year or so to enable the necessary financial and physical arrangements to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to what sorts of options there may be, that is essentially a matter for the review process to untangle. The reality is that, in terms of the primary or national distribution of pay television, there are two basic options-the satellite and Telecom bearers. The satellite tends to be the preferred technology because it is substantially cheaper. In regard to local delivery systems, there are essentially four technical options. One is multipoint distribution systems (MDS)-very high frequency distribution by radio frequencies, which I have described in another Press release today and on which we have been sorting out our policy. There are the two cable options-coaxial and optical fibre-and, of course, there is UHF or VHF television through a properly encoded mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA> Those four options are technically available and could be introduced, so far as coaxial cable or MDS is concerned, relatively early, should the policy go-ahead be given and should any entrepreneur be willing to meet the financial cost that is involved, because they are both pretty expensive technologies. There will be available in 1990 at least one UHF frequency in each capital city. That could be used more or less immediately in the event that the policy decision was made. It could be used in conjunction with MDS, for example, as a secondary distribution mechanism. There is only one frequency available in the immediately foreseeable future, so to that extent the options are somewhat narrow. What will really open up the options is the availability, on a community-wide basis, of optical fibre from the latter 1990s-probably more like 1997 than 1995. That will create many possibilities for an expansion of pay or subscription television beyond the relatively limited opportunities that will exist technically before then.</PARA>
<PARA> How to balance all of these considerations is something that the Government will obviously be giving a lot of attention to. The plan at the moment is to prepare a public discussion paper which fully canvasses all of these options over the next three months or so, put that out in the public domain for an extended period of consultation and debate, perhaps have some sort of parliamentary committee inquiry running alongside that, and complete the process of decision making some time next year in order to give ample lead time to enable pay television to be introduced-if that is the decision-by the end of 1990. I think that that is an entirely rational, systematic, step-by-step approach to a very difficult and sensitive policy problem. I would like to see the Opposition do any better.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read the article in the Adelaide News. I think the headline was a little dramatic. I think `stodgily admonished' would have been a more appropriate headline, but I guess it would not fit so well. The criticisms made by Senator Messner about access to polling booths by the disabled and the elderly are not entirely unfair. Senator Messner and others should realise that once an election is called, apart from State schools, we have no priority for halls. So any bidding for particular booths has to be done on a first come first served basis. Quite often, especially if it is the time for fetes and other things to be held, we do not have priority to use booths. But we do make sure that in every subdivision at least one booth is accessible to the disabled and the elderly. We also send out an electoral information pamphlet to every elector these days, listing a whole range of things-offering postal votes, explaining absentee votes, and listing every booth in the electorate where he or she may vote. Certain booths, marked with an asterisk, are available to the disabled and the elderly. I notice that Senator Messner suggested that we could put up temporary ramps to help people. I point out that that is not so easy when we take the compensation aspect into account. In many cases those temporary ramps can be very dangerous. We acknowledge these days that it is the right of the disabled and the elderly to vote at the booths. They should not be forced to vote by postal vote and, as I say, at least one booth in every subdivision is, wherever possible, accessible to those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other dangerous thing that Senator Messner does not allude to is the fact that the various conservation groups have adopted a new tactic of asking that stickers be put on ballot papers. Their standard tactic is to stand outside the polling booth, hand out the stickers and, at two minutes past six, issue a Press release saying that 35 per cent of the people put a sticker on their ballot paper. That sort of thing is all right except for that small percentage of people who do put a sticker on their ballot paper and then drop the remains on the floor. In the Adelaide by-election two elderly people tripped over and fell because of those conservation stickers. If that sort of behaviour continues we might have to outlaw those stickers in polling booths and the conservationists of the world will have to make up some new fibs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Government aware of the widespread concern, concern even shared by the  H. V. Evatt Research Centre in recent days, that Aussat Pty Ltd has not or cannot make available to its board members or the general public precise estimates of future demand for its services which would inspire confidence that there will be a sufficient future stream of income to meet its debt servicing obligations in respect of any purchase of second generation satellites? Does the Minister agree that Aussat is unlikely to be able to obtain any level of borrowing without implicit government guarantees? In view of the taxpayers' direct interest and concern in any such contingent liability, is the Minister prepared to request Aussat to make public the results of a study recently completed by PA Management Consultants on the future needs of Aussat's major users?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the very substantial borrowing that will be needed to underpin the second generation Aussat satellite could reasonably be suspected to be forthcoming only against a government guarantee, explicit or implicit. I do not for a moment deny the reality of that part of Senator Alston's question. As to whether or not the cash flow and profitability potential of Aussat are such as to justify the full extent of the borrowings presently contemplated for the full extent of the original second generation program, that is something to which the Government will obviously be giving very close attention, as will the Aussat board, in the next few weeks as this matter comes to the point of final decision. In the meantime I do not propose to preempt that decision-making process in any way, nor to speculate on the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously the Government is conscious of its responsibilities to taxpayers; on the other hand, it is very conscious of the nature of the technology and the risk factors and so on involved in satellite ventures of this kind. It has never regarded them as likely cash cows in the same way as a number of other telecommunications and broadcasting ventures might be regarded. The matters raised by Senator Alston are significant and important, but I can assure him they are ones that the Government is well and truly apprised of and is very carefully looking at.</PARA>

Mr Lloyd, a frontbencher, put up a proposition to increase Commonwealth outlays by $77m in Queensland last week. So, far from providing a list of explicit spending cuts, all the National Party has done has been to put up proposals to increase spending by just over $700m in two weeks. The question drew attention to the fact that Senator Stone said that he did not want to get into the particularities of the BCA proposals. It is fair enough to stay away from the particularities of the BCA proposals, but he does not have any particularities of his own. The reason for that, I suppose, is that he is not allowed to speak about outlays any more than he is allowed to speak about taxation, except in the most generalised terms to say that it would be a good idea to reduce taxation. The other fork of the National Party tongue out there amongst its own constituency says that it will be a good thing to increase outlays as well-increase outlays and reduce taxation.

<PARA>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask: Is the Minister aware that the dispute on the Quadrant building site in Canberra City has now entered its ninth week, despite a direction from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that all bans and limitations be lifted and that a 10-tonne concrete tank was dropped next to a pump, preventing it from being taken from the site, allegedly because the pump operator refused to provide two cases of ``grog'' as demanded by the crane crew? Is he aware that an official of the Transport Workers Union who sought to assist in moving the pump was threatened with violence by an official from the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association and a member of the crane crew? Is he also aware that the Commission, in a hearing on the dispute, has described the ACT building industry as being in a state of anarchy and said that the union was supporting liars and frauds and that events on the site raised a question of criminal action? Is he aware that the staff of White Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd have been intimidated, abused and physically assaulted in relation to the dispute and that the car door of the industrial relations director of the Master Builders Association (MBA) was smashed in while he was attending a meeting at the site? Is the Government aware that it has been put to the ACT Master Builder's Association that the solution to this dispute is for him to collect a bag of $10,000 to pay to the crane driver for him to leave town? Is the Government aware that there is a complaint that elements of the union movement have attempted to blackmail members of the council and executive of the MBA into silencing the association from putting these facts forward? I ask: Why has the Government not responded to the MBA's letter of 23 March seeking assistance in dealing with this appalling situation? What is the Government's attitude to the state of anarchy in the ACT building industry? What action is the Government taking to deal with the matter?</PARA>
<PARA>In my reply, I undertook to refer the question to the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Minister has provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware of a continuing dispute on the Quadrant project and that Commissioner Baird issued a direction on 26 February 1988 that normal work resume.</PARA>
<PARA>I am also aware that a number of statements have been made by the Master Builders' Association of the ACT alleging that improper industrial practices, violence, abuse, intimidation, criminal action and blackmail have occurred on this site. Until yesterday I was not aware of an allegation that the dispute could be settled by the payment of $10,000 to the crane driver, but I have since confirmed that the ACT MBA has made such an allegation.</PARA>
<PARA>These allegations are of an extremely serious nature and, if true, would constitute a deplorable state of affairs in the ACT building industry. If there is truth in the allegations then I would have expected those with the evidence would refer them to the police to allow a proper investigation. In fact, this very course has been urged upon the Master Builders Association on a number of occasions by the Government. In the absence of such action however my colleague the Minister for the Arts and Territories has written to the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, requesting a police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to allegations of improper industrial practices, Commissioner Baird has referred the transcript of proceedings before him on 26 February to the Inquiry into the Building Industry being conducted by a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Officers of the Department of Industrial Relations have strongly recommended to the Master Builders Association of the ACT that it raise its concerns in the Inquiry. The Government has intervened in the Inquiry and will make submissions as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not accept, however, the ACT Master Builders' Association claim that it has exhausted the available processes under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Master Builders' Association has not sought to take the matter to a Full Bench of the Commission nor has it sought to obtain a bans clause to activate the compliance provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the MBA (ACT) first conveyed its concerns to the Government there have been numerous contacts by my Department, the Office of ACT Administration and the Office of the Minister for the Arts and Territories, with employer associations and the Building Workers Industrial Union on ACT building industry problems and specifically the Quadrant site question. The Government has been advised in the course of these discussions that negotiations are in progress in an attempt to settle what is a complex dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>Unless the current problems in the building industry are resolved quickly it will be difficult to maintain a substantial building program in the ACT. The Government therefore believes that it is incumbent upon the employers to exercise their rights under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to resolve these issues without any further delay.</PARA>

<TITLE>ADVERTISING OF INTEREST RATES</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have obtained further information in relation to the question asked by Senator Patterson yesterday in respect of the advertising of interest rates and the role of the Trade Practices Commission. The Trade Practices Commission has sought the cooperation of financial institutions to ensure that consumers are not misled about the true rates of interest they are paying. In connection with its role in educating business about its responsibilities under the Trade Practices Act, the Commission from time to time publishes guidelines in relation to matters which are causes of concern to it. In 1986, a guideline was published, titled `Deposits and loans: their advertising and the Trade Practices Act', discussing, among other issues, the use of unqualified interest rate figures in advertising, failures to make clear whether rates are fixed or variable and the making of inaccurate comparisons of the costs of loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Financial institutions which advertise interest rates in a manner contrary to the guidelines or in any other fashion which may mislead or deceive consumers are at risk of legal action by the Commission. Industry acceptance of the guidelines is currently being reviewed by the Commission. Consumers are also afforded protection by credit legislation applicable in the various States and Territories. In relation to regulated credit sale and loan contracts, such legislation requires the giving of an `annual percentage rate' which will approximate the effective rate of interest. Credit legislation, including disclosure of interest rates, is being reviewed by a working group of Commonwealth and State officials which is examining consumer financial services. Another relevant development is the working party on interest rate description which was recently established by the Standards Association of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I answered a question from Senator Panizza and indicated that I would take part of that question on notice. I now have something to add to that answer. The question concerned eligibility for Medicare of overseas students and overseas visitors. Foreign students undertaking courses of study in Australia are currently eligible under the Medicare arrangements. Long term overseas visitors-that is, those with an entitlement to remain in Australia for more than six months-are also covered by the Medicare arrangements, except where a visit is specifically for the purpose of obtaining medical or hospital treatment. Short term overseas visitors, that is, those visiting for six months or less, are not generally eligible for Medicare unless the visitor is from a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement, such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Medicare eligibility provisions generally have been the subject of extensive review for some time. Specifically the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) recently wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on the question of Medicare access for overseas students. This matter will be the subject of discussions between the officers of those departments in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Bolkus. During Question Time Senator Bolkus referred to me as a rising damp in the Liberal Party. While at first sight this may seem to be a somewhat trivial matter, I take strong objection to being placed in a category that can be described as `rising damp'. The truth is that the Liberal Party as a whole and I as an individual reject the categorisation of individuals into one stereotype or another as `wet' or `dry'. The Liberal Party and I see such categorisations as useless because they deny the responsibility and freedom of the individual to choose the political path of his or her own making and imply the need to choose, as Labor does, between one faction or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has always acknowledged the primacy of the individual, unlike the Labor Party, where, if one votes against the Party by crossing the floor, one is out on one's ear, like poor old Senator Georges. People have attempted to apply a number of descriptions to members of the Liberal Party and rising damp is not a new one. A colleague of mine occasionally refers to himself as the Perrier of the Liberal Party, namely, the sparkling wet. We can have sparkling wets, dripping dries, or whatever. I claim to be misrepresented because I do not fit into any of the categories that Labor would seek to apply to us. I regard myself as a Liberal, and I am proud to be so. I am happy to accept the freedom and individual political choice that being a Liberal passes onto me. I would be ashamed to be a member of the Labor Party, which has such a poor view of individualism. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I point out that the obvious proof of the points that I make is in the notes that the Minister used in his answer to the question without notice, which clearly was not without notice because he had a prepared script. I wonder whether the prepared note referring to me as a rising damp-the load of drivel that it was-was prepared by a public servant for the Minister. If so, I wonder whether the taxpayer expects public servants to spend their time incorporating personal political assessments into draft answers. Scripted jokes, pathetic jokes, are indicative of a level of cognitive capacity which, if I were the Minister, I would not be proud of. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the notes that were previously tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The notes read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent article reported the concerns of welfare groups in Queensland. We should not be surprised that the primary concern is the low level of education, transport and housing concessions provided by the Queensland National Government. </PARA>
<PARA> But the answer to the Senator's question is that FAS is not the limit to the Government's attack on Child Poverty. It is a crucial centrepiece, but it is part of a much broader commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> As the PM pointed out at the recent Child Poverty Conference, any attack on Child Poverty must also include issues such as:</PARA>
<PARA> job creation</PARA>
<PARA> the cost of housing</PARA>
<PARA> reform of education and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government remains committed to the broad approach which has delivered:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 million new jobs since 1983</PARA>
<PARA> $5.3 billion on public housing since 1983</PARA>
<PARA> 110,000 approved childcare places</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to an attack on child poverty is strong:</PARA>
<PARA> Family Allowance Supplement is now being paid to 115,000 working families. </PARA>
<PARA> the increased child payment is also being paid to 412,000 pensioner and beneficiary families. </PARA>
<PARA> increased Rent Assistance $15 per week is payable with FAS. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone doubts the importance of the Government's achievement with FAS, they should listen to these words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``I would like to thank the person or persons . . . who devised, developed and approved the family allowance supplement for working families. The extra $88 per month is a godsend.'' Letter to West Australian</PARA>
<PARA> Or from Helen Brownlee of the Institute of Family Studies:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The achievement of the benchmarks will mean a reduction in child poverty of more than 75% in working families and more than 30% in non-working families''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is making steady progress towards achieving the benchmarks for FAS:</PARA>
<PARA> 15% of married rate pension for children till age 13;</PARA>
<PARA> 20% of married rate pension thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> Over every year since 1983 we have made significant improvements in the level of payments for children:</PARA>
<PARA> from 11.1% of Married Rate Pension</PARA>
<PARA> to 12.0% in 1984, 12.6% in 1985, 13.0% in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> up to 14.1% for children under 13 and in 1987 and 17.2% for children 13, 14 and 15. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Scheme, passed in this place last night will also bring substantial relief to sole parent families. For the first time it will be possible for sole parents to receive regular maintenance, without humiliation or threat of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The achievement and commitment of the Government in this area is outstanding. Let us compare this to the Opposition. In 1983 when Senator Chaney was Minister for Social Security:</PARA>
<PARA> 200,000 people and their children were thrown onto the unemployment heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Child Payments had fallen from 15.2% of Married Rate Pension in 1977 to 11.1%. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensions had been cut in real terms by 2.4%. </PARA>
<PARA> The rising damp of the Liberal Party, Senator Van Stone is a record condemning the destructive effect of our policies on families. I ask her to consider the effect of budget cuts advocated by her colleague. The Shadow Treasurer: What would be the effect of:</PARA>
<PARA> reducing the child qualifying age to 10 as the Opposition suggested at the last election?</PARA>
<PARA> abolishing Family Allowance and replacing it with a flat rate payment. </PARA>
<PARA> cutting back on Childcare. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect would be to send Australian families back to the despair of the early 80s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a report which appeared in this morning's Canberra Times, and it arises from an incident at the Duffy Primary School fete on 31 October 1987. This morning's report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Mark Howard Kenta, 17, who had his charge changed from murder to manslaughter, pleaded guilty to punching and kicking Grant Andrew Cameron at the Duffy Primary School fete on 31 October 1987 and causing his death. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been great disquiet in the community over this incident, particularly in relation to the change of the charge from murder to manslaughter. The accused was brought before the Canberra Court of Petty Sessions some time ago now and was committed for trial by a magistrate on the charge of murder, but from then until now something has occurred which has caused that charge to be downgraded. There may be good reason for this but certainly it is not apparent to people in the community, who feel very worried indeed that a young boy can go to a school fete and finish up dead after being kicked and punched. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard of this matter some weeks ago and I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions after receiving letters and telephone calls from people who were appalled at the suggestion of the reduction of the charge from murder to manslaughter as a result of some arrangement that no-one knows anything about. I received a letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions dated 13 April 1988, in which he, in part, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter was properly brought to my attention because of the painful nature of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that the `painful nature of the case' is a rather strange way to refer to the incident that occurred resulting in the death of a young boy. The matter then came before the court yesterday, the accused having agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge. The Chief Justice who heard the case, then adjourned it until 29 April this year, pending receipt of a welfare report. He spoke of strong disappointment about the report not being ready, as reported in the Canberra Times. As I understand it-and my understanding might be wrong-it was clearly expected that the welfare report was to be available yesterday. The matter has now been put off. What makes this a matter of great concern to a number of people is the fact that the Children's Services Ordinance No. 13 of 1986, which came before us last year, has not yet been proclaimed. I am told that it is to be proclaimed on 26 April. The provisions of that ordinance will mean that the penalty may be somewhat less severe than might have been the case had the matter been dealt with yesterday. There is disquiet about this matter. How can it be that, when the magistrate committed the accused on a charge of murder, something was able to be done behind the scenes for the charge to come out as manslaughter, to which a plea of guilty is entered, and then yesterday the case was adjourned until 29 April, in a way that leads many people to think that there is some advantage in this--</PARA>

<PARA> Dear Senator Reid,</PARA>
<PARA> I apologise for the delay in replying to your letter of 25 March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to indict the youth involved in the death of Grant Cameron on a charge of manslaughter was made by me. The matter was properly brought to my attention because of the painful nature of the case. I and others here who have considered the case were mindful, as we always are, of the interests of the victim and those close to them. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the legal issues were clear. The law requires that to make out a charge of murder the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was done with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The first of these had no application and the evidence and circumstances of the case did not prove the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion if the youth concerned had been indicted on a charge of murder then a jury would not have found the case proved to the requisite standard. In fact I doubted whether a murder count would be allowed by the judge to reach the jury. </PARA>
<PARA> You have noted that the youth was committed on a charge of murder. That of itself does not discharge my duty to ensure that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charges preferred. Further, I note that on the hearing of the bail application Gallop J. expressed the view that the Crown case was slight. </PARA>
<PARA> I can well understand the concern within the community and your need for further information on the subject. The matter is, however, still before the courts and I am reluctant to go into further details. As you may be aware the matter is listed for hearing on 18 April 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should mention that I have great sympathy for the parents of the deceased. On 23 March 1988 I wrote to them explaining my decision. </PARA>

<PARA>DEATH-CHARGE YOUTH `DIDN'T LIKE WESTIES'</PARA>
<PARA>By Andre Coelli and Deidre Mahoney</PARA>
<PARA> A youth had allegedly kicked a boy to death because the youth ``didn't like Westies'', the A.C.T. Supreme Court heard yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mark Howard Kenta, 17, who had his charge changed from murder to manslaughter, pleaded guilty to punching and kicking Grant Andrew Cameron, at the Duffy Primary School fete on October 31, 1987, and causing his death. </PARA>
<PARA> In a statement read by the prosecution, Mr Kenta had allegedly arrived at the school about 4 p.m. with a friend. The two had been drinking and been in aggressive moods. Mr Kenta had allegedly wanted to provoke a fight and had approached Mr Cameron, who had been talking to some younger boys. The prisoner had said to Mr Cameron, ``I don't like Westies'' and had delivered two or three heavy blows to Mr Cameron's face. He had then kneed Mr Cameron in the stomach and the boy had fallen to the ground. Mr Cameron had tried to get up, and had been on all fours and had allegedly said, ``What did I do?''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kenta had then kicked Mr Cameron in the neck. Mr Cameron had fallen, rolled on to his stomach, had begun shaking and his face had turned blue. He had been taken to Woden Valley Hospital but had been brain-dead on arrival. </PARA>
<PARA> After the kicking, Mr Kenta had left but someone had stopped him and asked him what he did it for. He had replied, ``I don't know'', had laughed, and said, ``I think I killed him''. </PARA>
<PARA> An autopsy had revealed that Mr Cameron had died from head and neck injuries, which had caused a sub-arachnoidal haemorrhage to all surfaces of the brain. </PARA>
<PARA> In his record of interview with the police, Mr Kenta said he had been punched the night before at Rumours disco, in Phillip, for being dressed in trendy clothes. The person who had picked on him had looked like a ``Westie'' [a person from the Western suburbs of Sydney, usually dressed in gym boots, denim jeans and a checked shirt]. </PARA>
<PARA> The next day he had gone to the Duffy fete and seen Grant Cameron leaning against a fence. He had thought he looked like the Westie who had punched him the night before. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interview, Mr Kenta said he had hit Mr Cameron in the mouth and asked him if he wanted a ``blue''. He had hit him again, and ``kicked him in the guts''. </PARA>
<PARA> He had told police he had been watching another fight that had ``stirred him up''. He had decided to ``blue'' with Mr Cameron when he saw him at the fete. He had not been sure he was the man from Rumours, but had told police, ``You have to put them down first before they hit you''. </PARA>
<PARA> It had later been confirmed that Mr Cameron had not been at Rumours. </PARA>
<PARA> The blows had been a sharp blow to the eye with his right fist, and a quick right to the centre of the face. He had said face blows shocked more. He had kicked Mr Cameron with his bare feet on his chest or stomach. He had seen people running to Mr Cameron, and thought he had broken his neck, as he had heard someone shout this. </PARA>
<PARA> He had told police in the interview that he hoped Mr Cameron was all right, and would do anything he could to help. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian Federal Police spokesman said Mr Kenta, then 15, had left school in Year 9, as he felt he was being picked on, and had had various jobs since then. He was an A.C.T. ice-hockey representative. </PARA>
<PARA> The spokesman, Detective-Sergeant John Lawlor, said he felt Mr Kenta lived a loutish lifestyle, drinking and possessing a gang mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> A senior social worker with the juvenile justice branch of welfare, Mr Michael Tidbill, said he felt the Qamby remand centre would not be suitable for Mr Kenta. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Allen Bartholomew, previously a consultant in psychiatric services at Pentridge Prison, Melbourne, said he thought Mr Kenta ``a pretty normal, adolescent boy, with very little psychiatric interest''. He said that, statistically, people who pleaded guilty to murder or manslaughter were unlikely to repeat such an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Chief Justice Miles adjourned the case till April 29, pending a welfare report, He spoke of a strong disappointment with the report not being ready. </PARA>
<PARA> ``This is a difficult matter and an unusual one,'' he said. ``Assistance is available in other parts of Australia; I don't see why it's not in the national capital.''</PARA>
<PARA> He granted $10,000 self-bail, with two sureties of $10,000 each. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to hold the Senate up for a few minutes but I believe that I have been misrepresented and I am taking the opportunity of the adjournment debate to talk about it. I refer to notices of motion in the Senate Notice Paper to set up a proposed select committee on agricultural chemicals. In a letter to the President of the National Farmers Federation dated 18 March 1988-and I understand in various other letters written to various primary producers and primary producer bodies-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You will be well aware that the proposal for an inquiry was not initiated by the Government but by the beef industry through the Liberal-National Coalition Opposition. Notwithstanding recent disclaimers from the Opposition spokesperson on rural matters, I draw your attention to the attached Hansard extract from December 15 1987 which clearly shows what the Opposition was trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA>The enclosure is a copy of Senate Hansard dated 15 December 1987, page 3104. On that page is reported a notice of motion, given by leave, about the setting up of a select committee. In Minister Kerin's Press statement of 16 March he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not initiate the inquiry. The dubious honour belongs to Victorian Liberal Senator Austin Lewis . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Both statements are untrue. As page 3063 of the Senate Hansard reveals Senator Powell of the Australian Democrats, on the morning of 15 December, on behalf of the Democrats, gave notice of a motion seeking the establishment of a select committee on the use of agricultural chemicals in Australia. So the dubious honour that Minister Kerin refers to is in fact Senator Powell's honour, if it is an honour. The motion given notice of was for a very wide ranging inquiry. As a result of the concern of the Liberal and National parties about Senator Powell's proposal, by leave that evening I gave notice of a motion, which I have referred to and which Minister Kerin keeps quoting, which was put as an alternative proposal of a much more limited nature as a counter to the Democrat's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The sole intent of my notice of motion was to give the Government an alternative which would be restricted in scope, compared with the Democrat's notice of motion, to issues relevant to specific problems and in particular questions of speedy compensation and assistance to growers who were and are suffering quarantining. The facts of life in this Senate are that no party can carry a motion without support from other parties. I had made it clear to the Government that the coalition parties would not-repeat not-support the Democrat's proposal and that I understood that the Democrats would not support the coalition proposal. I had had certain discussions, which were confidential, the result of which was that the Government and the Minister's staff were well aware of our position and that I was ready to negotiate further. That gave the Government four options: The first was to support the Democrat's notice of motion with its wide-ranging scope. The second was to support the coalition notice of motion with its narrow scope and capacity to resolve the question of speedy compensation to quarantined farmers. The third was to oppose both motions, in which case it is likely that both motions would have been lost. It came then to me as a considerable surprise to learn that Minister Kerin chose to support the Democrat's proposal, which means no speedy compensation to quarantined farmers but a wide ranging examination of the problems created by chemicals to primary industries around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Kerin did not attempt to negotiate further with me, which he could have done as the fourth option. Worse than that, Minister Kerin keeps claiming that it is my notice of motion that is causing the Government to support the Democrat's notice of motion. That is nonsense. The Government is not required to support the Democrat's notice of motion because of my notice of motion. I might add that the Democrats would have great difficulty getting their notice of motion up in accordance with the procedures in this chamber. The coalition parties have not been asked by the Minister or the Government to withdraw their notice of motion. I can assure the Minister and the Government that we would give earnest consideration to any such request. Our concern is the protection of primary industries and primary producers in Australia.
