<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will make possible a more flexible approach to Commonwealth overseas debt raising and management activities in the interests of more cost effective management of the Commonwealth's external debt portfolio. In particular, the Bill enables the Commonwealth to use a wider range of modern borrowing instruments and would assist in the management of foreign currency exposure with currency and interest rate swaps and other hedging techniques. This is essential if the Commonwealth is to minimise the cost of its external debt portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Act do not provide the Government with additional powers to borrow money overseas. However, under present arrangements, the Government can only issue securities, such as medium term notes or short term commercial paper, with the Governor-General's approval for each issue. This is because under the present legislation each issue or short term rollover is considered to be a new borrowing. In practice, it is very cumbersome to submit each issue of notes under a medium term note program, or frequent rollovers of short term debt, for approval. Under the proposed amendments to sections 3 and 5a, the Governor-General could approve a program of borrowings up to a certain limit. This would be consistent with the arrangements applying to the Commonwealth's domestic borrowings and powers held by other OECD sovereign borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The new subsection 5b (1) is designed to provide the Treasurer with specific power to enter swaps or other financial agreements for debt management purposes. Swaps, which are essentially agreements between two parties to exchange financial obligations, are used extensively by a large range of international borrowers as a hedging technique. Section 5b (1) would also enable the use of other debt management techniques, such as interest rate caps which are designed to limit exposure to floating interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government already has the authority to enter swap arrangements under the Consititution (and has undertaken a number of swap transactions during 1987-88), subsection 5b (1) would provide specific authority to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed legislative amendments to subsection 5b (2) provide for standing appropriation for swaps. Swaps contracts are presently being met from annual appropriations but, given their unpredictable nature, it would be more appropriate if they were funded by way of standing appropriation. Such an amendment would bring more certainty to the future commitment of funds to honour swap contracts and would put swap funding on the same basis as overseas borrowings which are covered by standing appropriation. It is in line with the Government's view that unpredictable outlays be authorised by standing appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> In seeking Executive Council authority for the Government to undertake overseas loans and swap arrangements, it has been customary for the Governor-General, in the documentation for each loan, to give the Treasurer the power to submit the Commonwealth to foreign legal jurisdiction and to waive legal immunity for the Commonwealth in respect of itself or its property (except for property used or intended to be used for diplomatic, consular or military purposes). Accordingly, the new section 5c encompasses the existing arrangements formally into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the proposed legislation (section 5d) expands existing arrangements for the Treasurer to delegate his powers regarding borrowings, swaps and other financial agreements or arrangements to a specified departmental officer or, in overseas countries, to a specified member of the Australian diplomatic mission. This would allow Treasury officials to set prices in line with market conditions subject to least favourable terms set by the Treasurer. Under a medium term note issue, securities are offered to investors continuously at market related rates and it would not be practical for the Treasurer to determine individual bond prices on a continuous basis (possibly several times a week). </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide the Government with the flexibility to undertake a wide range of overseas borrowings and make more timely use of favourable interest rate or exchange rate movements to manage its debt portfolio more efficiently and reduce the overall cost of the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1987-88 expenditure on net swap payments was $11 million and the Government has appropriated $30 million for these purposes in 1988-89. The transactions undertaken in 1987-88 were essentially aimed at changing the composition of the Commonwealth's external debt liabilities to better hedge the debt portfolio against possible exchange rate risk. The proposed amendments will ensure that swap commitments are provided for under standing appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have a second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the employment provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act. Sections 85 and 86 of the Act provide for the determination of salaries and terms and conditions of employment of ASIO staff by the Director-General of Security, the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department and the Chairman of the Public Service Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 34 and 35 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Amendment Act 1986 substitute the ``Public Service Board'' for the Chairman of the Board and the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. There is now no longer a Public Service Board or a Chairman. An amendment is therefore required to remove these outmoded references and to ensure that staff of the Organization receive the benefit of wage increases awarded to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, salaries and terms and conditions will be determined by the Director-General, who will be subject to any guidelines that the Attorney-General may give him pursuant to section 8a. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to section 8a makes it clear that guidelines under the section can be given in relation to these matters. These amendments thus provide a mechanism for ensuring that public sector policy on pay and conditions is taken into account by the Director-General as well as recognising the special circumstances associated with employment in the Organization. </PARA>
<PARA> The references in sections 85 and 86 to the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department are also being removed, since it is no longer appropriate for this officer to be involved in the determination of pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has no financial impact. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Social Security introduced the Bill for the Child Support Act in the Parliament late last year the Minister indicated that maintenance would be able to be collected for all children of a marriage or for those ex-nuptial children where a State had referred its powers. Four States, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, agreed to refer their powers relating to ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also indicated that special provision was being made to provide for the collection of maintenance of ex-nuptial children of Queensland and Western Australia should either State, in the future, refer their powers to the Commonwealth, pass corresponding legislation or adopt the Child Support Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, both Queensland and Western Australia have now indicated that they intend to adopt the Child Support Act as a means of including ex-nuptial children in their States in the Government's new child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> So as to enable the adoption of the Child Support Act by Queensland and Western Australia to be effective, the Attorney-General has advised that some minor technical amendments are required to be made so that the Child Support Act will also apply where maintenance orders or agreements in respect of ex-nuptial children are made under the law of a State. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill simply makes those technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly mention the present position in relation to the possible use of the Child Support Agency for collection of maintenance for state wards. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions are proceeding with each of the States through the income security sub-committee of social welfare administrators. While the government is pleased with the progress of those discussions the Government does not expect that any state would seek to use the Child Support Agency for collecting maintenance for state wards until those discussions are concluded. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Treasurer announced in the 1988-89 Budget that the Government has decided that an annual supervisory fee is to be levied, commencing in 1988-89, on life and general insurance companies. The purpose of this fee is to recover the ongoing costs of supervision of such insurers under the Life Insurance Act 1945 and the Insurance Act 1973 respectively by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate, namely the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988, gives effect to this announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to make a number of other amendments to insurance industry supervisory legislation. The Bill incorporates measures to provide for the registration under the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 of insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers. It will also effect a number of amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the existing supervisory arrangements, all of which will increase the level of protection available to the insuring public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is structured into five parts. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I includes the commencement provisions and provides for specified provisions to come into operation on the 28th day after the day on which the Bill receives the Royal Assent, and for all other provisions to come into operation on day or days to be fixed by Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II amends the Insurance Act 1973 to include the new provisions relating to the levying of the annual supervisory fee on general insurers. It also repeals section 113, which deals with unauthorised foreign insurers, in order to remove legislative overlaps with section 34 of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III amends the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to include new provisions requiring the registration of all insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, and the collection of statistics regarding premiums remitted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV amends the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977 to repeal two redundant unproclaimed sections. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 in five ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to include the new provisions relating to the levying of the annual supervisory fee on life insurers;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to introduce the concept of `appointed actuary' for the purpose of performing certain functions required under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to repeal certain redundant provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) to change the period for furnishing to Parliament the annual report on the workings of the Act. The proposed period is to be within 3 months of the year ending on 30 June which corresponds to the reporting period provided in the other Acts administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) to effect a number of other changes intended to clarify and enhance the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address the more significant provisions of the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the annual supervisory fee in respect of life and general insurers. At present, the cost of supervising the life and general insurance industries is borne by taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed annual supervisory fee on life and general insurance companies is based on the application of the ``user pays'' principle. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach is not a new one; it already applies in a number of areas of government activity. For instance, registration fees are imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of insurance brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a supervisory fee applicable to occupational superannuation funds and approved deposit funds that wish to take advantage of relevant concessions available under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed fee reflects the Government's view that, generally, where a service is designed to benefit a particular group, the cost should be borne by that immediate group of beneficiaries of the service rather than by taxpayers in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The supervisory fee will be payable into Consolidated Revenue. Its imposition will not affect the existing arrangements under which the financial resources made available to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission are subject to the same scrutiny processes as are applicable to Commonwealth departments generally. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, the proposed annual fee will be a flat fee and will be $19,000 for each registered life insurance company and $11,000 for each authorised general insurance company. Appropriate regulations to give effect to these fees will be sought later this year following passage of the Bill. The proposed supervisory fee has been estimated to raise $2.9 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed fee will be payable in respect of financial years ending on or after 1 July 1988. It is intended that the fee be paid at the same time as an insurer's annual returns are normally lodged with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The first fees will be payable by insurers in 1988-89 and will be applied to offset the Commonwealth's costs of supervising the industries in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the proposed changes covered in Parts III and V of the Bill. These proposed amendments-to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-have been the subject of consultations with representatives of industry bodies including, where relevant, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia. In addition, some of the other amendments provided for in the Bill have emerged as a result of suggestions put forward by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 do not provide as much protection to consumers dealing with agents of unauthorised foreign insurers as to those dealing with either agents of authorised insurers or brokers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of agents of authorised insurers there is more scope to enforce the statutory requirement that an insurer must accept liability for the conduct of his agent. Brokers must in general hold professional indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is of the view that those insured should be allowed access to overseas insurance markets where they wish to seek it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government believes that insurance consumers should be reminded of the importance of considering the possible implications of entering into insurance contracts with offshore insurers who are not supervised under Australian insurance law. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background the Bill will provide increased protection for those insured by including certain additional provisions in the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> A key additional requirement will be that all insurance intermediaries who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers will be required to be registered under the Act, unless they are already registered as an insurance broker. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, these intermediaries, as well as registered insurance brokers who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers, will be required to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) provide to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission a copy of any agency agreements they have with an unauthorised foreign insurer (the agreements to be available for public inspection);</PARA>
<PARA> (2) obtain written acknowledgement from the insured that cover may be provided in whole or in part by an unauthorised foreign insurer; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) provide an Annual Return to the Commission on their activities in this area. This Annual Return will enable the Commission to monitor the volume of business placed with unauthorised foreign insurers through insurance intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be scope to make regulations to impose a requirement on intermediaries operating under these provisions to take out professional indemnity insurance cover in respect of their operations in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposed amendments concerning the Life Insurance Act 1945. These amendments are considered necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the Act, particularly in relation to the functions required to be performed by actuaries, and to clarify a number of the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important of these amendments will introduce a new provision to require each life insurance company to identify an actuary as the `appointed actuary' to the company. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last decade or so, there has been a substantial increase in the variety of life insurance products marketed by life insurance companies. Consequently, life insurance business has become much more complicated than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, it has become increasingly important that actuaries of companies performing certain statutory functions under the Life Insurance Act carry out those functions in an objective and professional manner notwithstanding the fact that they may be receiving remuneration from the companies concerned. Creating the position of an `appointed actuary' will assist in achieving this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill will require each life insurance company to appoint an actuary as the `appointed actuary', within a certain period of time, for the purpose of performing the actuarial functions specified under a number of provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Small life insurance companies will not be precluded from appointing a consulting actuary as `appointed actuary'. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of `appointed actuary' will assist the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in identifying the particular actuary for each company who is responsible for discharging the key actuarial functions required by the Life Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As a minimum level of experience, an appointed actuary must be a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia of not less than 5 years standing. This qualification is regarded as necessary in view of the importance of the functions to be performed by the appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement for an appointed actuary is supported by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions to increase the threshold for publication in the Gazette of life insurance unclaimed moneys from $20 to $200. Publication annually of all unclaimed moneys of not less than $20 is a time-consuming and costly procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposed change will apply to statements of unclaimed moneys as at 31 December 1988 and later, and should result in significant administrative savings as it has been estimated that in excess of 50 per cent of all unclaimed moneys are below $200. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will not affect a person's right to make a claim in respect of unclaimed moneys, including amounts less than $200, where satisfactory proof of claim can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> To increase public awareness of unclaimed moneys, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be making available the statements of all new unclaimed moneys from 31 December 1988. These lists will be available for public inspection in the Commission's Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The unclaimed moneys provision in the Life Insurance Act is also being amended to give to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner power to authorise payment of unclaimed moneys. This is appropriate given the arrangements put in place last year with the passage of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other changes proposed in this Bill is an amendment to alter the timing for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to submit a report to the Treasurer on the workings of the Act. This time will be changed from five months after 31 December to three months after 30 June each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has overall responsibility for preparation of annual reports not only in respect of the Life Insurance Act 1945, but also the Insurance Act 1973, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. This proposal will allow the Commissioner to more effectively carry out his responsibilities under those Acts by producing a single consolidated annual report within 3 months of 30 June each year. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment involves repeal of section 13 which permits the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to arbitrate in a dispute between a life insurance company and a policy owner in relation to a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision has been used only once in more than 40 years of operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is not equipped to provide arbitration services and it is therefore more appropriate that such disputes be settled by recourse to commercial, legal or other channels. At the same time, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is examining in conjunction with other Government agencies and industry bodies possible additional arrangements for resolving disputes between insurers and policyowners. </PARA>
<PARA> Other proposed amendments include:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) repeal of two redundant unproclaimed sections of the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977 relating to the conduct of non-insurance business by registered life insurers without the approval in writing of the Commissioner, and the registration of companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) improvements to certain definitions within the Life Insurance Act 1945;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) enhanced requirements for the provision of information in applications for registration under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) clarification of a number of existing provisions to remedy uncertainties in their administration;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) a reduction in the period of notice required to be given by life insurers before issuing a special policy to replace a policy that has been lost or destroyed; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) enhancements to the review provisions in the Act to take account of introduction of the appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the various measures which I have outlined will enable the Government to recover the costs of supervision of the general and life insurance industries. The measures will also provide worthwhile increased protection for the insuring public and, consistent with the Government's broad approach to regulation, will not impose undue burdens on the industries involved. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TRITICALE LEVY BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the Associated Levy Collection Bill will provide the basis for the establishment of triticale research funding arrangements. The triticale industry will join other small emerging industries unable to support their own independent administrative arrangements in developing a research capacity under the auspices of the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on triticale produced in Australia for the purpose of funding triticale industry research. The Associated Triticale Levy Collection Bill 1988 will provide the machinery for collecting the levy. Expenditure of moneys raised through the levy will be matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Administrative and organisational arrangements for the research scheme will be provided by the Australian Special Rural Research Council pursuant to the Rural Industries Research Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The triticale industry is a relatively small industry but has the capacity to expand its domestic markets and possibly to develop significant export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry research to date has been funded by a voluntary levy on the industry with some Commonwealth funds from the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The industry has established research programs in several States but those programs have rested on a precarious funding base, with no capacity to expand to meet the needs of an emerging industry. Recently these programs and funding have proven inadequate to cover the range of issues the industry needs to address to develop as an efficient and competitive industry on the domestic market and in a hostile world market. The Commonwealth supported program is intended to provide secure arrangements for an expanded research effort into production and beyond that into areas such as economic and marketing research.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for an initial levy rate of one dollar per tonne of triticale. Provision exists for the rate to be varied by regulation up to a maximum of two dollars per tonne. Provision is also made for any recommendations arising from consultation between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Triticale Industry Organisation to be taken into account prior to any adjustment to the operative rate of the levy or leviable weight. </PARA>
<PARA> Amounts equal to the levy will be paid into a separate account established for the purpose in the special research fund. This will be accommodated by a provision in the accompanying amendments to the Rural Industries Research Act 1985. The Commonwealth's matching contribution will be up to a maximum level equal to 0.5% of the average gross value of triticale production. It is expected that initially the levy will raise about 160,000 dollars. The special research council will therefore have scope for an annual triticale research program approaching three hundred thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The commencement date of this legislation will be on a date to be proclaimed. It is intended that the levy be imposed on triticale produced in the 1988 harvest. </PARA>
<PARA> A full year research program under the scheme cannot begin until 1989/90. However the actual level of expenditure on research will be determined by the Special Research Council and it is possible some research could be funded in 1988/99. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>TRITICALE LEVY COLLECTION</PARA>
<PARA>BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this bill is to provide the machinery necessary for collecting the levy imposed by the Triticale Levy Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should be read as one with the Triticale Levy Bill 1988, and is to come into operation on the same day that the Levy Bill becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifies the liability of purchasers and receivers under the scheme, outlines penalties for non-compliance and provides appropriate powers of enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no financial implications other than those covered in the Second Reading Speech for the Triticale Levy Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>RURAL INDUSTRIES RESEARCH AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of this Bill are</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to provide for an improved organisational and administrative framework under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 (Principal Act);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to enable the expenses of collection and administration relating to relevant levies to be recovered from the Australian Special Rural Research Fund; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to remedy minor defects in regulations under the Principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The main organisational amendments will enable:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) new levies to be added to existing rural research schemes without having the effect of creating new Councils and new Trust Funds;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) matching Commonwealth contributions for any statutory levies paid into the Australian Special Rural Research Fund; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the amalgamation, re-organisation and winding up of Councils and Trust Funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The first two of those amendments will have imminent application under the Australian Special Rural Research Fund in relation to the triticale industry. Bills for triticale industry levy imposition and levy collection were introduced with the Rural Industries Research Amendment Bill 1988. Amounts equal to triticale levies received into Commonwealth revenue will be paid into the Australian Special Rural Research Fund to be used for the purposes of research and development relating to the triticale industry. The Government will provide funds on a matching basis up to a maximum contribution of 0.5% of the triticale industry's gross value of production, in the same way as it provides matching contributions to existing Rural Research Funds. Negotiations are well advanced for addition of other small industry research levies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no immediate application contemplated of the new provisions enabling the amalgamation, reorganisation and winding up of Councils and Trust Funds. The new provisions would allow, for example, a smaller Fund to amalgamate with a larger Fund for economic purposes. The amendments would also provide, in that event, for the smaller Fund, and Council, to be wound up and the money in that Fund, relevant levies and research agreements to be transferred to the larger Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Where such an amalgamation takes place, levies raised from each industry involved and the Government's matching contributions will continue to be for the purpose of funding research for that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments enabling new levies to be added to existing rural research schemes without having the effect of creating new Councils and new Trust Funds will not apply in relation to the Barley and Wheat Trust Funds and Councils. This exclusion from this Bill had regard to the need to consult with the State Research Committees for Barley and Wheat before including them in such an amendment and the current examination of the feasibility of a grains research and development corporation which could include both barley and wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three main amendments to the administrative framework. First, there is a clarification of the form for the annual research and development program that Councils are required to submit to the Minister for approval. The new form will provide for essential information, without unnecessary detail, to be included in a council's annual program for the Minister's consideration. Approval of individual project expenditure will continue to be the responsibility of Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, Councils will be able to replace a partly completed 5-year research and development plan with a varied plan to cover a new 5-year period. Under existing arrangements, a Council's plan, or varied plan, relates to a fixed 5-year period at the end of which a new plan is prepared for a further fixed 5-year period. The new arrangements will provide Councils and State Research Committees with more flexibility in their planning systems particularly in incorporating changing industry and market circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the existing legislation requires the approval of Councils or State Research Committees for the bulk of expenditure under sections 9 and 36 of the Principal Act. However, some expenditure relating to a council, or State Research Committee, for example administrative expenses and investment management expenses, can be made currently without the approval of the Council or Committee. This is clearly undesirable. This legislation will require Council or State Research Committee approval for all such expenditure that relates to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Special Rural Research Fund (ASRRF) was established to support small and infant industries. It has been funded from appropriation sources. There has been no attached industry levy. The legislation provides for small industry levies to be credited to ASRRF. When the triticale levy imposition and levy collection Bills currently before the House become law, the triticale levies will be attached to the ASRRF. In line with Government policy, the Principal Act is being amended to enable the expenses of collection and administration of relevant levies to be recovered from the ASRRF. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of minor defects have been identified in the regulations under the Principal Act. These are being remedied by provisions in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will contribute to effecting Government policy on rural research funding. The Bill facilitates matching Commonwealth funding of rural research under the Australian special Rural Research Fund, but of itself has no budgetary implications beyond those announced in the May 1988 Statement on Primary Industries and Resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said on many occasions, rural research is a high priority of the Government. This is partly reflected in the Government's commitment to increase Commonwealth matching contributions to rural research to a maximum of 0.5% of the gross value of production for each of the industries concerned. Commonwealth matching funding for 1988/89 is budgeted at $65.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT</PARA>
<PARA>BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wheat Marketing Act 1984 to reflect the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission was established in October 1986 by the Commonwealth and Mainland States. Its charter was to identify the most efficient and cost-effective integrated system for the provision of grain storage, handling, transport and port terminal services and to make recommendations on changes necessary to put such a system into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> In its Final Report the Commission concluded that there were significant areas where the present system was not providing the best service to grain growers. It also found that significant savings of around 10 dollars per tonne could be achieved from a more flexible and competitive distribution system. This translates to total resource cost savings across Australia annually of around 100 million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve these savings the Commission recommended that grain marketers and growers be given greater choice in selecting their least-cost grain distribution paths, and that greater competition be permitted in the provision of grain distribution services, including in all elements of the grain distribution system-marketing boards, storage and handling, land transport and ports and shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission proposed that marketing boards take more responsibility for the efficiency of the grain distribution system, particularly the minimisation of storage, handling and transport costs, and the passing of actual costs of port services and sea transport back to growers to encourage competition between ports. It also recommended that marketing boards be given the capacity to exercise choice over licensed receivers. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly in the storage and handling area, the thrust of the Commission's report is toward greater competition and grower choice, with the main recommendations involving the removal of sole receival rights, commercialisation of bulk handling authorities and bringing them under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the land transport area, the recommendations are aimed to encourage greater competition between road and rail, and allow growers wider choice. They include removing restrictions on the use of road for grain transport, the removal of the 2 dollars and 50 cents surcharge charged by Australian National Railways in South Australia, greater commercialisation of rail services and bringing railway services under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commission recommended specific targeted funding for local roads in the short term and, in the longer term, the establishment of an efficient road-user charge and funding allocation system. </PARA>
<PARA> For ports and shipping there was support for the continuation of moves to commercialise port authorities, and support for more competition in the provision of port services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government strongly endorses the Commission's recommendations and is moving to implement them as quickly as possible. It is continuing to build on reforms to improve the efficiency of the road transport industry. Agreement has been reached with State and Territory Governments on a single set of rules for the country's trucking industry. The Government has also introduced a new five-year road funding program which provides for specific assistance to national arterial roads. The Commission's recommendations in regard to rail services are also well in hand as they apply to Australian National Railways. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments currently before the Parliament flow from the Commission's recommendations for the operation of marketing boards. In amending the Wheat Marketing Act in advance of the broader reforms being proposed for wheat marketing generally, the Government is clearly signalling its concern that the grains industry benefit as early as possible from the advantages of a system which offers greater flexibility and choice. Both the AWB and the Grains Council of Australia endorse this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Improved efficiency and effectiveness in the grain distribution sector will of course have important flow-on effects for the competitive marketing of grain generally, both in Australia and overseas. The proposed amendments therefore represent an important step in achieving a framework within which the Australian wheat industry can effectively meet the challenges of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically the Bill provides for the AWB to enter into contracts for services relating to grain distribution and broadens the scope of the term authorised receiver to encompass all bodies corporate with whom the the AWB has a contract for wheat receival. This means that no longer will the AWB be constrained from dealing with bodies other than the sole receiver authorised in each State as at present. Rather, the Board will be able to contract with whomever will provide the best returns for growers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of returns to growers, the Bill provides a clear statement that the principal object of the Board shall be to maximise net returns to growers from the marketing of wheat and that this should be the overriding principle in the performance of its other functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board will also be required to provide disaggregated charges for these services in its accounts to growers to the extent that this is possible and does not incur significant net additional costs. Growers will therefore be more aware of the costs associated with the individual services employed to receive, handle and transport their grain and will be in a better position to make choices as to their least-cost grain path. </PARA>
<PARA> This being said, I do not anticipate, and neither did the Royal Commission, that there will be dramatic changes in the short term. The current bulk handling authorities will remain the dominant providers of storage and handling services and road and rail transport will largely retain their existing tonnages. However, they will be exposed to competition and face pressure to contain their costs. </PARA>
<PARA> What is envisaged is a progressive redirection of grain flows through the most efficient storage and handling facilities, and a reallocation of the grain transportation task between road and rail so that each undertakes that part of the task for which it is best suited. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other changes announced by the Government are significant in opening the door to competitive pressures. Nevertheless I acknowledge that the bulk of the Commission's recommendations fall within the ambit of the States. I am therefore hopeful that the States will follow suit, as I have urged them to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I am encouraged by recent announcements that the New South Wales Government has adopted the Royal Commission's recommendations and will also be introducing changes to its system. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of the Bill will involve no costs to the Commonwealth. On the contrary, it will facilitate the development of a more cost-effective grain distribution system with increased industry efficiencies and benefits to the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned last night, I was making a point about what the Australian Taxation Office had said about where the tax file number would not be required to be used. I mentioned loan accounts of all descriptions, including mortgages, credit cards and leases, and the fact that the tax file number would not be required for non-interest bearing cheque accounts or for existing-I emphasise the word `existing'-interest bearing accounts with banks, building societies and credit unions where the interest paid or credited each year remains below $120. I think I stated that about 70 per cent of accounts with building societies and credit unions fall below this level. I also said that the tax file number would not be required to be used with investments subject to quotation requirements where the person is prepared to accept deductions for tax at the maximum marginal rate at the time the income is paid, and also for a range of investments such as real estate and insurance bonds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone, Senator Michael Baume, Senator Durack and Senator Hill have already spoken in this debate. Senator Panizza and Senator Crichton-Browne are still to speak in this debate. I think all the honourable senators who have spoken have made very worthwhile contributions. I will not go on much longer, except to say that the amendments to the tax file number proposal and the criteria set down by Mr Howard last year for the coalition are now met with the three criteria being agreed to, and effectively that deals with tax fraud, does not jeopardise civil liberties and is cost-effective. The Opposition has stalled the tax file number being surreptitiously turned into a de facto ID card through the back door. I think the work of the Hon. Neil Brown in the other place has been essential to making the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill a workable Bill. I am quite sure that the $300m that it effectively will raise out of the community will be wisely spent by this Government. Let us hope that it does spend it more wisely than it has spent many of the other extra taxes that have been garnished from the Australian people over the last few years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, which has arrived after much delay. Honourable senators may remember that it was supposed to have been operative as from 1 November 1988. The only problem was that the Government did not do its homework and ascertain whether it was acceptable to the majority of the Senate, hence the delay. The biggest push to make sure that it was not another Australia Card, which was totally rejected by the Senate last year, came from Western Australia. As a result of the good work done by the hierarchy of our Party to make sure that this was not a pseudo-Australia Card, we now have legislation that should be acceptable to most Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Originally I considered it intrusive and offensive and it did not fulfil its supposed purpose. It was another Australia Card, with the same objectionable aims and hidden agenda. The agenda was to pry into the lives of Australians at large, while at the same time not attacking areas such as tax cheating and tax dodging where the Government should have been cracking down. Under this Bill, it will now not be compulsory for a taxpayer to supply a tax file number. It will need to be supplied to an employer only if the taxpayer wishes to be taxed at his marginal rate. If the employee chooses not to supply the number he will pay tax at the top rate, with the addition of the Medicare levy. At the end of the financial year, on filing a tax return the taxpayer will receive a refund, if there is one. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not too many. I agree that not too many will be able to afford it. In the case of interest bearing deposits in bank accounts, a depositor, if he chooses not to disclose his tax file number, once again will pay the withholding tax of 49c plus the Medicare levy, which works out at about 50.25c in the dollar. Once again, any overpayment would be refunded on filing a tax return. Should a person who deposits money in an interest bearing account not supply a tax file number, at least he will pay the withholding tax. In other words, if someone is not playing the game and has a vast amount of money in an interest bearing account it will be picked up. Of course, as Senator Haines said, there are many people who cannot afford not to supply the number, and if they have to supply a number someone else knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What worries me is that, believe it or not, there are taxpayers who legally hold more than one tax file number. </PARA>

A person may have a personal tax file number; he may be in partnership with his wife and have a number for that; he may have another tax file number for a partnership with another person; and he may have another for a company. So it is possible to have quite a few legally. Senator Maguire said yesterday that anyone with more than one tax file number is a criminal. That is certainly not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that later on. What worries me are the ones who quite legally have more than one tax file number. I think page 21 of the explanatory memorandum deals with that. I cannot see anywhere in the legislation where it says they do not have to go through that process. It seems to me that those who already have a number and who are doing the right thing in paying their tax and at the end of the year filing their tax return-unless someone can point out that I am wrong-still have to go through the same process and get themselves a tax file number. Getting a tax file number is not just a matter of writing to the Australian Taxation Office or filling in a return and the Commissioner of Taxation giving someone a number, even if it is a person's first return, whether early or late in life. He or she has to go through a certain procedure by going to the local post office. For instance, a natural person would be asked to provide two different category A documents plus one category B document or three different category B documents. One of those documents is an Australian birth certificate, which I suppose is fair enough. At least the local postmaster will know how old someone's wife is. Others could be a current Australian passport, a degree, a curriculum vitae and all that sort of thing. I think it is an invasion of privacy for one's local postmaster to know how well or how badly someone has done in a university course. In other words, everyone has to go through the procedure even though he or she has been playing the game all along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the case of the Government interfering with systems that are already working properly. One system that was introduced some years ago that is working properly is the prescribed payments system. Page 13 of the explanatory memorandum tells us, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>At present, where a payee fails to quote a TFN to a payer under the Prescribed Payments System, the rate of deduction is calculated at 30 per cent, double the applicable deduction where a TFN is quoted. From a date to be proclaimed, non-quotation of a TFN by a payee on a deduction form will result in a deduction of 50.25 per cent being made from the prescribed payment. </PARA>
<PARA>On my understanding that forces everybody who is subcontracting to supply a tax file number to a prime contractor. One would have to unless one had a mint of money. Taxation already takes out about 15 per cent from a payment for a contract, and that is most of the profit for that job. If that figure goes anywhere near 50 per cent, the Government will be taking not only the profit but also the working capital, which is being used to pay for materials et cetera. So if the subcontractor has 50 per cent or so ripped out, and he is probably paying his Medicare levy elsewhere anyhow, he will have no working capital left. No-one can tell me that this legislation does not force everyone to use a tax file number, even though this legislation says it is totally voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to say that this legislation does not attack the areas it should. The first area I mention is the black economy. I believe most people accept that there is a black economy in Australia, something, incidentally, that this Government has done nothing about. This Bill will not be able to attack it either. It will not be able to attack the payment of employees or subcontractors, or whatever one can think of, being taken out of the till. The only way some employers in the hospitality, entertainment and other trades can get casual employees is by paying them out of the till. I do not know what the solution is, except that the Australian tax rate as a whole is too high and that is probably the reason why the black economy continues. As I say, the legislation fails to address the black economy in any way whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not attack the use of false names-a point made, I think, by Senator Haines. Of course, false names are used to defraud the social security system as well. The legislation certainly does not attack that fraud. It does not attack the problem of large amounts of money deposited in cheque accounts which do not earn interest. I gather that when opening a cheque account one will not have to provide one's tax file number. The legislation also does not seem to me to attack the problem of large amounts of money held in solicitors' trust funds. That matter is addressed on page 32 of the explanatory memorandum where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>A deposit of money with a solicitor (a defined term . . .) to be either invested by the solicitor or to be lent under an agreement to be arranged by or on behalf of the solicitor is included in the investments to which new Part Va applies. </PARA>
<PARA>As I see it, if a person has a large amount of money in a solicitor's trust fund but has not instructed the solicitor either to invest it or to lend it under an agreement, that situation does not appear to be covered by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the use of multiple bank accounts. This procedure has been used in the past by certain taxpayers to dodge their responsibilities. This Government has chosen now to limit to $120 the amount of interest that can be earned each year on bank accounts before investors have to provide their tax file numbers. I believe that in the case of children that amount of interest can be up to $420 or thereabouts. That matter is addressed on page 67 of the explanatory memorandum. I do not know how this will be policed. I do not know how the Australian Taxation Office can in any way prevent the breaking down of single accounts into multiple accounts to ensure that investors always earn a bit less interest than the maximum. By my quick calculation, one would need about $1,100 in an investment account to earn $120 interest in a year, at today's interest rates. One would need much more money in a passbook account which earns interest at only 4 per cent per annum. One would need about $2,700 in such an account. One could have a multiplicity of such accounts either in different banks or, indeed, in the same bank but in different branches. I cannot see how this legislation proposes to attack that problem. There is an attempt to cover it, and on page 67 of the explanatory memorandum under the heading `Conducting affairs so as to avoid file number requirements' it is stated that the intent is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to prohibit persons from structuring their investments to exploit interest thresholds proposed for pre-existing accounts with banks, building societies or credit unions . . . and certain investments of children . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed new section applies in situations in which it would be `reasonable to conclude' that a person had structured an investment. How on earth will the Taxation Office decide that? How can it really trace those accounts? The Government should be dinkum in its intention to cover everyone and treat everyone fairly, regardless of whether they are millionaires or ordinary people trying to restructure their accounts to avoid taxation. People should be treated equally. If the Government were dinkum, it would have recommended a start from a nil balance, where any interest is gathered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already covered casual employment, where most of the rorts in tax avoidance are going on. The Government has been very slack in attacking the black economy. Government supporters always call people on this side of politics friends of the tax cheats, but the Government is willing, as it has been for some time, to let the defrauding of the Department of Social Security go on and on, and it is doing nothing to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Government speakers last evening bore out what I have believed all along about this Bill, and that is that it will be the foot in the door for a future Australian ID card-while this Government is in power, anyway. The overall cost of the set-up will hardly make it worth while for what the Government is attempting to get. Whatever the cost will be, will it be worth while for what will be received? We are told that we will recover $3.3 billion over the next 10 years, which works out at about $330m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been running around the countryside over the last six months saying that if this Bill were not passed, once again we would be branded as the friends of the tax cheats. They further said that they may not be able to deliver next year's tax cuts, and that is probably about the third or fourth excuse for not delivering next year's tax cuts. We all know that they are not going to come or, if they come, they will come on a reduced basis whereby only a few people will benefit-mainly supporters of the other side and at a time when the next election is coming up. </PARA>
<PARA> The saving of $330m per year will hardly make up for the tax cuts that were promised in the first place-but that figure is coming down vastly as the days go on, and I understand that financing tax cuts will require $3 billion to $4 billion per year. As I said before, with a lot of work on this side of politics in pressuring the Government and negotiating with the Government to make this into better legislation, the main thrust was on the Privacy Bill. By ensuring that it was debated and passed through this House at the same time and came into effect on exactly the same date, we were able to give it our support. As everyone knows by now, the Opposition supports the legislation. Although I had strong reservations in the first place, as did most Western Australians, we are now behind the legislation, and through this Bill we hope the Government will be able to do something to overcome the tax cheating that is going on and get itself off our backs with its continual branding of us as friends of tax cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we had another serving from Senator Coates about how we have been doing that and how well the Government did by bringing in fringe benefits tax, and he talked about people bringing sandwiches in a brown paper bag for lunch. However, what the senator totally ignores every time, is the damage that fringe benefits tax has done in the remote areas, where various fringe benefits or housing must be provided to enable the jobs to be filled. If anyone does not believe me they should visit the country areas of Western Australia where the mining boom is really showing what Australia can do in that field. It is keeping Australia afloat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988 and the Privacy Bill 1988. Honourable senators will be aware that the former Bill is the Government's response to the failure last year of the Australia Card legislation. The Privacy Bill is an updated version of the Bill which was introduced with the Australia Card legislation in 1986 in an effort to seduce the public into accepting the ID card. It should be stated at the outset that the Government's updated tax file number (TFN) system must be accepted for what it is. It is a numbering system. It is an identifier. But because it is a system of identification there is a very real concern amongst the community that the tax file number will amount to a de facto ID card. Once introduced into Australia governments will find it hard to resist the temptation to expand its scope and to encompass transactions it was not originally meant to regulate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also concerned about comments to the effect that the system is now, in all respects, voluntary. I have some difficulty with this notion, given the pecuniary penalties involved in not quoting one's tax file number. I suggest that the system operate with the assistance of a certain amount of compulsion. Further, certain aspects of the privacy legislation are unsatisfactory and fall short of the minimum standards recommended in 1980 by the organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines and protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data. My major concern with the legislation is that, in practice, the TFN system may quickly become another Australia Card-a universal identifier. It is for that reason that the coalition has gone to the great lengths that it has to negotiate with the Government a number of changes to the Bills to ensure that a back door ID card will not be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience in particular demonstrates that legislation of this kind, even if originally limited in scope and intent, will quickly escalate to cover the fields of human transactions and dealings. The Australian Privacy Council calls this `function creep'; that is, `a substantial confinement of the uses of the identification system to taxation purposes is a constraint which will be eroded by the incremental addition of functions for which the tax file number will become an essential adjunct'. </PARA>
<PARA> This concern with `function creep' was reflected in the additional term of reference (b) given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when the Committee was requested to report on the `possibility of the scheme developing into a de facto national identification card system with unacceptable imposition being made upon privacy and civil liberties'. It was on that point that the Committee noted the Canadian experience with a social insurance number (SIN) and the United States social security number. In each case the number was introduced originally for a very limited purpose. The Canadian system was to assist the administration of an unemployment insurance scheme and the United States social security number was introduced to number accounts for persons who fell within the Act. Honourable senators will be aware that the use of the SIN in Canada reached the farcical stage where it was required for application for participation in the annual wild goose hunt. The Canadians have now realised that the SIN was being used as a universal identifier and are taking steps to dismantle many of its uses. The Hawke Government's TFN system could easily follow the same path. It is clear that the TFN was intended as a replacement for the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced on 30 September last year that it would seek to introduce a high integrity tax file numbering system, continue with its Cash Transaction Reports Bill and develop a national register of births, deaths and marriages. It is clear that, in principle, the TFN has many of the hallmarks of the Australia Card. The major differences are that there will be no card and a tax file number will not be issued to the entire population. The objects of the TFN legislation are contained in proposed section 202 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The first object of the use of a tax file number is:</PARA>
<PARA>to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the matching of information contained in reports given to the Commissioner . . . with information disclosed in income tax returns . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed that income matching within the Australian Taxation Office will be the only role of the TFN. However, the Department of Social Security will be collecting tax file numbers for the Taxation Office in relation to unemployment and sickness benefits. The third object contained in proposed section 202 provides that the TFN will be used:</PARA>
<PARA>to facilitate the administration of any legisl- ation . . . under which benefits are provided by the Commonwealth to students in relation to . . . higher education . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also appears that the Tax Office will be using TFNs for the purpose of administering the child support scheme. As the legislation now stands, the use of TFNs is restricted to the Taxation Office. Under proposed subdivision Ba of part IV of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, it is an offence for a person to require the recording of a TFN unless provision is made by or under a taxation law or a law relating to the higher education charge. However, it would not be difficult to imagine the seductive influence the use of TFNs would have for the Department of Social Security, for example. Presently, the Department of Social Security will act as any other employer in collecting TFNs in relation to unemployment and sickness benefits. The Senate Standing Committee noted at paragraph 9.54 that other indirect benefits will flow to the Department from the TFN. In evidence to the Committee, Mr Murphy of the Department gave an example concerning a person receiving family allowance while being paid unemployment benefit. Mr Murphy stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We will report the taxation file number of those people for unemployment benefit purposes but if we wanted to ask information about confirming taxable income for family allowance purposes we would not use the number because we are precluded from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it is not hard to imagine the Department of Social Security wanting additional access to tax file numbers. If granted, function creep will have begun and the TFN will be on the way to becoming a universal identifier with which we are all concerned. The Parliament and the people of Australia have a duty to be vigilant to ensure that governments of the day, particularly centralist governments, do not give in to the desire to extend the use of the TFN system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some difficulty with the claim that the TFN system is now no threat to privacy because it is voluntary. The option exists for people not to quote their tax file number if they do not so wish. Under amendments to the Income Tax Regulations, however, a penalty must be paid for this privilege. This penalty is to be in the form of a withholding tax at the top marginal rate-that is, 50.25c in the dollar-plus the Medicare levy. This is the amount an employer will be required to withdraw from an employee's pay packet in respect of any given week's work. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this situation is far better than that which has existed previously. It is no longer an offence, for example, for persons not to quote their tax file number when required. Further, the original proposal of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to prohibit the withdrawal or transfer of funds from interest bearing accounts with financial institutions has now been scrapped. These and other concessions have been extracted from the Government by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> To say, however, that the system is now voluntary is, in my view, to overstate the situation. I ask honourable senators to consider how voluntary it is for ordinary Australian wage earners currently paying tax at a marginal rate of 29c in the dollar or 40c in the dollar plus the Medicare levy to be suddenly faced with deductions being made at the rate of 50.25c in the dollar simply because they wish, on principle, not to quote their tax file number. I suggest that, however much these Australians might have a fundamental objection to having to quote their tax file number and however much they want to stand firm on their principles, it is inevitable for economic reasons that their principles will run a distant second to having sufficient money to feed, clothe and educate their families. For these people, the non-quotation of their tax file number is simply not an option. For these people, the system is far from voluntary. Yet I am sure that it is these people, perhaps more than any other group in the community, who would feel the most resentment against any tax file number system. </PARA>
<PARA> The perception of losing one's identity and rights is strongly felt amongst ordinary wage and salary earners. These individuals are no doubt very concerned at what they see as a centralist government taking away their inherent rights and replacing them with a series of rights granted to them by the prevailing government and its bureaucracy. In my mind there is no better demonstration of this concern than the recent referendum, in which 70 per cent of Australian voters rejected question No. 4, which sought to enshrine certain rights in the Constitution. Further, I recall Senator Puplick on the original Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card saying that, at least to his mind, there was a grave concern on the part of Australians that we were reverting from being a common law society to a civil law society-in other words, we were gradually losing our inherent rights and having them replaced by granted rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Martyn Webb of the organisation People Against the Australia Card made the point in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on 20 July this year that the fact that the Government's proposed system involved numbering was not of itself the problem. In response to a question from the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney, who asked him whether he saw the number itself as a problem, Professor Webb said:</PARA>
<PARA>No, not the number alone; it is the use to which that number is put and the compulsion that lies behind it. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Webb went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . once you have adopted that position, you can find better solutions than the upgraded tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard I note the addendum to the Standing Committee's report, written by Senators Alston and Hill, in which they stated:</PARA>
<PARA>On the evidence put to the Committee we are not satisfied that other less intrusive methods do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable senators went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, we express disappointment at the cursory manner in which alternative approaches were treated in the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) submission. </PARA>
<PARA>Senators Hill and Alston made the point that an income matching facility had already been developed by the Australian Taxation Office which was capable of further significant upgrading with the consequential benefits to revenue and without the necessity of a new tax file number scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in July this year the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, stated that the Tax Office had received additional revenue of $2.4 billion over the last financial year as a result of increased recovery of evaded tax. To me, this suggests that the Commissioner already has extensive powers at his disposal to deal with tax evasion which would allow, to a great extent, the elimination of abuses in the taxation system. Examples of these powers are the 100 tax audit `hit' teams which the Commissioner let loose on the corporate world after recent improved auditing procedures had increased collections. The Commissioner estimates that these audit teams will net $315m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Taxation Office has sufficient powers under the Income Tax Assessment Act already. These powers are only now being tested in terms of scope and I would have thought a numbering system would be less than necessary until it is discovered exactly what limits are imposed on the Tax Office's existing investigation and recovery powers. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comments relate to the Privacy Bill 1988. As I said previously, this Bill is an updated version of the one which appeared in conjunction with the Australia Card Bill in 1986. The present Bill generally retains the 11 information privacy principles (IPPs) of the 1986 Bill, although with some amendments. These privacy principles are based on guidelines recommended by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on 23 September 1980 as a result of a working group chaired by Mr Justice Michael Kirby. The OECD guidelines are expressed to be `basic principles of national application' and should be regarded as `minimum standards' for the protection of privacy and individual liberty. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the information privacy principles contained in the Bill, clause 17 provides that the Commissioner shall issue guidelines concerning the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information. Interim guidelines are contained in schedule 2 of the Bill. An interference with the privacy of an individual occurs when an IPP or a guideline issued under clause 17 is breached. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the information privacy principles in the Bill do not at least reach the minimum standards for the protection of privacy as declared by the OECD and as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee. Of course, the state of protection afforded by the Bill is far better than it was prior to the acceptance by the Government of a number of coalition amendments. Without these amendments, the Privacy Bill would have been totally inadequate for providing privacy to individuals from the use of the tax file number system. As a result of coalition recommendations, the Bill now provides for guidelines to be issued for the collecting, storage and use of tax file numbers. Defects, of course, remain. </PARA>
<PARA> Primarily, the Government has not seen fit to provide a right to sue for breach of an IPP or a clause 17 guideline. I urge the Senate to support the coalition amendment in this regard. Defects also exist in the privacy principles themselves. For example, the first three IPPs deal with the collection of personal information. The major defect is that a collector of information is under no obligation to inform an individual that information has been collected where that information is collected from third parties. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>The right of the individual concerned to be made aware of personal information supplied by a third party to an agency is catered for in IPPs 5 and 6 requiring information to be made available by agencies about records held by record-keepers and means of access to those records. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is just not good enough. It is clear that, if individuals are not in fact aware that information about them has been collected, they have no reason to contact recordkeepers with a view to ascertaining whether or not personal information which concerns them is being held. The OECD and the Australian Law Reform Commission were both of the opinion that information should be collected with the knowledge or consent of the data subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, although IPP 1 prohibits the collection by a collector of information by unlawful or unfair means, there is no such limitation when information is collected by a collector from third parties who have obtained that information by unfair or unlawful means. IPP 2, which deals with the solicitation of personal information, also does not attain the standard required by the OECD purpose specification principle. The OECD guideline stresses that individuals should be informed of the purpose for which data is collected no later than the time of collection. IPP 2, however, requires that, if it is not practicable to do so prior to the time of collection, the collector need only make the information available to the person `as soon as practicable after the information is collected'. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be a fundamental right of the individual to know for what purpose information is collected and where it will be put. The decision whether to supply the information required may well depend on the purpose for which the information is to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (e) of the same principle also imposes an obligation on the collector to inform the individual of any person, `body or agency to which it is the collector's usual practice to disclose' the information. There is, however, no such requirement to inform the individual where disclosure is to be made to, for want of a better word, unusual agencies. I would have thought that informing the individual would have certainly been more important in the latter case. Indeed, it is a matter of some concern that the clause seems to indicate that the collector may not even know the final destination of the personal information collected. </PARA>
<PARA> IPP 3 is similar to the OECD's data quality principle, which requires that information be `accurate, complete and kept up to date'. Principle 3, however, omits the requirement of accuracy. I am aware that IPPs 7 and 8 impose the duty of accuracy on record keepers. However, I would have thought that when personal information is actually collected, a standard of accuracy ought to be imposed. I note that the Standing Committee is not in agreement with me on this point. However, I cannot be persuaded, on the evidence that I have read, that in any way my position is not tenable. The Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>An obligation to ensure accuracy at the time of collection would be impracticable, particularly where information was not solicited from the person to whom it related. </PARA>
<PARA>Given, however, that the obligation imposed by principle 3 is for the collector to take `such steps (if any) as are, in the circumstances, reasonable', I suggest that this is sufficient to ensure that any duty of accuracy is not unduly onerous. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to raise briefly an issue in relation to privacy principles 6 and 7, which deal with access to and alteration of records of personal information. These provisions are based on the OECD's individual participation principle and basically confirm but do not extend the rights of access and amendment contained in the Freedom of Information Act 1983. As a general comment, I have doubts as to whether the freedom of information approach which extends `the right of the Australian community to access to the information in the possession of the Government'-as contained in section 3 of the Act-is appropriate to provide a person with access to that individual's personal information. In this regard, I note that the Standing Committee has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . provisions for the amendment of records containing personal information, including provisions regarding the adding of notations to such records, be included in privacy legislation . . . rather than the FOI Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I am of the opinion that an individual about whom personal information has been collected has the fundamental right to ensure that the information is accurate and, if not, to require the record to be amended accordingly. I am concerned to ensure that the tax file number system does not operate to trample upon the rights and liberties of individual Australians. Equally, I urge the support of all honourable senators for the coalition's amendments to ensure that the privacy legislation, to be effective, will protect just that-that is, privacy. </PARA>

The reason the Government will not accept it is that the alternative system which had been proposed by the Democrats does not entail the use of a unique number and, therefore, would not be entirely effective even for banking transactions and bank interest and, more importantly, that employers do not number their employees at all, let alone number them in a unique way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Bill is a matter within my responsibility in this cognate debate. I first say how constructive and helpful the conversations that I had with Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Attorney-General, were in coming up with a proposal for this chamber to vote on which I believe is properly characterised as a very great advance indeed in the protection of privacy of those Australians who find themselves in a relationship with a Commonwealth agency to which information is given concerning the particular individual and in relation to the provision of tax file numbers, both to relevant Commonwealth agencies and persons, institutions or firms within the private sector such as employers or financial institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, the Bill as it is now presented to this chamber incorporates many improvements to a basic structure which will now ensure that the privacy of Australians is well safeguarded. In relation to that huge flow of information which is made available to Commonwealth agencies, there will be in force 11 information privacy principles. Those information privacy principles cover a wide range of matters, ranging from `Manner and purpose of collection of personal information' through to `Limits on disclosure of personal information'. I am quoting there from the heading to information privacy principle 1 and then information privacy principle 11. Between those two principles one finds a very comprehensive regime indeed to ensure that, if observed, interference with the privacy of individuals is either avoided altogether or fully justified by reference to other important competing social principles. </PARA>
<PARA> If the privacy of an individual is interfered with by reason of an act or practice engaged in by an agency breaching those information privacy principles, then remedial action can be taken and the primary objective of such remedial action is to do away with that particular act or practice in such a way that the bureaucracy functions in accordance with those information privacy principles; that is, in a way which is properly conscious of the need to safeguard the privacy of those many individuals who come into contact with the particular agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Privacy Commissioner will, as has been commented on by many senators, be of crucial importance and, indeed, the status, integrity and independence of that Privacy Commissioner will be very crucial. I believe that that appointment will be the key to the success of this legislation. In particular, in those instances where the Privacy Commissioner determines that what would otherwise be an interference with the privacy of an individual should not be regarded as a breach, with all the consequences under the Act, but is justified by a substantial competing public interest, I think that that sort of role indicates the very important part which the Privacy Commissioner will play. But even there the Parliament retains ultimate control because such an overruling of the normal operation of the Act will be disallowable by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in relation to the role of the Parliament in relation to the devising of the principles and guidelines which should protect the privacy of individuals that the major discussion between myself and the Opposition took place. In regard to the tax file number information which is provided by an individual-for example, to an employer or to a financial institution-it had been the intention of the Government that the Privacy Commissioner should create those particular guidelines after taking advice, particularly from an advisory committee which would be composed of persons with expertise but able, obviously, to draw on a wide range of consultation, particularly with the private sector, so that the guidelines which emerge not only serve the purpose of safeguarding the privacy of individuals but are not unduly onerous, in a regulatory sense, of the private sector upon which they are imposed. However, the Opposition and, to be frank, many members of my own Party felt that it would be better for the Parliament itself to at least elaborate on the guidelines which should apply from the very commencement of the operation of this privacy legislation; in other words, we should see the colour, the nature, the scope and the types of guidelines that the Parliament envisages should be applicable to the protection and the erecting of further safeguards and barriers in regard to tax file number information. Indeed, that is what has been done in schedule 2 to the Bill before us, which has as its primary focus paragraph 1.1, which proclaims:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number is not to be used as a national identification system by whatever means. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular heading really governs the various guidelines which are then set out in relation to the collection of tax file number information, its storage and security and the guidelines which should govern its use and disclosure, its publicity, and certain matters that should follow on the cessation of employment or an investment, and so on. All of this is supplementary and further safeguard to the very onerous and stringent provisions contained in the tax file number legislation, which, by way of imposing very severe penalties, indicates the intention of this Parliament that there should be no use, disclosure or request for tax file number information which is not strictly required and provided for under the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Bill now provides a very interesting mechanism for this Parliament to ensure that the guidelines relating to tax file number information are adequate for the better securing of that privacy. The guidelines in schedule 2 will be interim guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner will undertake the task which I outlined as the Government's first option. After consultation, he or she will provide those guidelines in a way which the Parliament can then consider. Only if those new guidelines are not disallowed within the appropriate number of sitting days will they come into operation and displace, to the extent that they should, the interim guidelines in schedule 2. In other words, at all stages this Parliament, and particularly this chamber, will have an opportunity to ensure that the guidelines relating to the protection of the privacy of tax file number information is indeed adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters which I could touch on, but it is the wish of the chamber that the committee stage consideration of these Bills take place as soon as possible. In order to facilitate that, I will conclude my remarks. Finally, I believe that this exercise has been a very good example of the constructive work that can be done with quite contentious legislation if those sorts of discussions which did transpire are allowed to take place away from the glare and drama of public confrontation. In the Bills before us we see emerging a very good example of the parliamentary process working well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation, as it is currently drafted, requires that individuals who are employed or who undertake investments of some sort with a financial institution, such as a bank, building society and so on, quote their tax file number as well as, of course, other details that are relevant to that institution. So somebody who starts employment or, as of next April, somebody who is in employment will be required to give his or her tax file number to that employer, and the same thing is going to apply to those people who undertake investments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has made much of the deal that it claims it has done with the Government, which finally persuaded it to support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill and the Privacy Bill in toto. The Opposition claims that what it has done is to introduce an element of non-compulsion to the legislation, so that people will not be forced to give their tax file number to a range of employers, financial institutions and so on in the community, thereby laying the foundation for a centralised database that can be used in a year or two to implement a national identification system. However, the deal that was done between the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party on this is not a deal that is going to give much joy to many people in this country. Senator Panizza admitted this in reply to an interjection of mine during his speech at the second reading stage. Because whilst it is no longer going to be an offence punishable by a fine or a goal term not to quote the tax file number to the range of people listed in the legislation, there will still be, and there properly should be, a sanction. That sanction is that the individual who does not quote a tax file number will suffer a 50.25c in the dollar tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not clear whether that starts from $1 or from the tax free threshold, but I presume it starts from $1. It is in fact giving no choice to the great majority of people. People on $100,000 or $150,000 a year, or the squillions that people such as John Elliott and Alan Bond are paid, can probably afford not to hand over their tax file number to their bank managers, investment advisers, stockbrokers, employers and so on, because they can afford to pay 50.25c in the dollar and then put in a tax return at the end of the year claiming overassessment and having that returned. But it is that level of people who will be helped by this deal that was done between the Labor Party and the Opposition that persuaded the Opposition to support this piece of legislation outright. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody on average weekly earnings-indeed, I would not have thought there were too many people on even $30,000 or $40,000 a year, much less people on average weekly earnings and less-is in a position to take advantage of this so-called choice element. Somebody who is earning $22,000 a year, who has a dependent spouse and perhaps two or three children, is not going to be able to afford to lose $11,000 in tax. Even if he does get it back at the end of the year, he will starve first. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments that we will be moving to clause 6 are certainly amendments I would have preferred not to be moving. The Australian Democrats would prefer to be in the position where this legislation had not even got this far, that governments had looked at some other way of recouping the $200m that they claim is being lost, the 26c per week per taxpayer that is being lost. But we are dealing with clause 6. I now seek leave formally to move both amendments to clause 6 in the name of the Australian Democrats which deal with two major elements of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(3) Where, after the beginning of the phasing-in period for this Division, a person becomes an investor as a result of a transaction carried out through a securities dealer, the securities dealer shall be regarded as an investment body for the purposes of the proviso in subsection (2).''. </PARA>
<PARA>My amendments to clause 6 attempt to achieve a genuine element of choice while still ensuring that this triumvirate that the Government is concentrating on continues to exist and that people are held to account. The triumvirate I refer to is, of course, the individual concerned, the institution concerned and the Australian Taxation Office. The Government's legislation, connived at with the support of the Opposition, insists that there be no flexibility within that three tiered system. The individual must give the tax file number to the institution. The institution, with the approval of the Australian Taxation Office, then takes out tax at whatever the set marginal rate is for that individual's wage or salary. What we are saying is that there are some people in the community who resent the fact that this proposal will lead to a national identification system. These people want the confidentially that has always existed in this country between the taxpayer and the Taxation Office to remain. By the same token these people do not believe that they deserve to be dragooned either into citing their tax file number or paying over half their salary in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have suggested is this: give people a genuine option. Those people who do not mind declaring their tax file number to all and sundry can do so; that is their decision. It is a real decision if they are making it without compulsion. Give those people who do not want to give the tax file number to the institution, the employer, the bank, or any other institution the option to talk to the Taxation Office. Our proposed amendments allow any person who, on or after, the first day of the phasing-in period of this legislation, becomes an employee to inform the Australian Taxation Office in writing of the relevant details within 30 days of that employment. That is not so difficult to put in place. It certainly is an improvement on the so-called choice that the Opposition was conned into accepting-a choice which is only for very high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will ensure that the taxpayer, the employer, the bank or whatever, and the Taxation Office, know that everything is above board. Does it matter whether that information goes A to B to C or whether it goes from A to C to B, for goodness sake? The three tiers are all involved. All the information is cleared by the Taxation Office. We are not allowing people to enter into little arrangements with employers, as currently happens, particularly in some service industries in which people are paid less than award rates and do not pay tax because they give false names. I have every sympathy for the Government wanting to recoup the proper amount of tax but I deeply resent the Government imposing on low income earners a system that it is not imposing on high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of social division is something that we have never seen legitimated in the statutes of this country. We have certainly got plenty of inequities and plenty of divisions. But this is the first time I can remember in which two main political parties have sat down and come to an arrangement whereby they divide people into low income earners and high income earners and put a form of compulsion on one group that does not apply to the other. For heaven's sake what has gone wrong with this place? I thought it was bad enough that a week ago I had to listen to Senator Messner say that the Opposition could not support us in taking the sales tax off a couple of items that were intended for use by children with disabilities, because that would have imposed unnecessary restrictions on the Government's revenue raising, and then three days later say that it will oppose the Government's gold tax. That sort of idiocy is bad enough but then to write into the statute books two classes of income earners in this country-low and high income earners, one of which is compelled to do something that the other is not-is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments I have circulated look complicated. They are not. Their complexity arises from the need to deal with a number of different areas because the legislation covers not just employers as institutions but also banks, building societies and other areas in which investments can take place. Therefore the amendments in effect say that people should have the choice of giving their tax file numbers to institutions or contacting the Australian Taxation Office within 30 days. The amendments run to 3 1/2 pages because they deal with all those clauses in the original legislation dealing with those sorts of investment and income earning areas. I certainly hope that the Opposition parties can see their way clear to giving a real option to low income earners; the same option that they have negotiated with the Government to give to high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, amendment No. 1 to clause 6 deals with tax file number declarations made by employees with regard to employment. Amendment No. 2 deals with declarations made by investors to those organisations that people use to invest what little money they currently have left. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the benefits of the amendments moved by Senator Haines relates to another Bill. When Senator Messner spoke in the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill he said that the tax file number would deal with social security fraud, welfare cheats and taxation cheats. By way of interjection I referred to another Bill which is presently before the House of Representatives, that is the Higher Education Funding Bill, imposing charges on higher education students. Later on in the debate Senator Michael Baume claimed that the Opposition's amendment had achieved a totally voluntary situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's proposal cannot apply to the Bill to impose charges on those people undertaking higher education. It is simply not possible to apply it to a charge on students which is, in fact, a loan. This is how the Government is dealing with the constitutional problem of the benefits. It can be applied when a person is earning income on which tax has to be paid. It can be applied to interest earned on money in bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefit of our approach is that it works in all areas. It imposes the obligation on the person involved. I wonder whether the Opposition is of a mind to limit the exercise purely to those situations described by Senator Messner. If it is we would look forward to Opposition support in defeating the Higher Education Funding Bill when it comes in here from the House of Representatives. However, I believe that that will not be the case. The Government and the Opposition will combine on that exercise so that there will be compulsion on some groups of people to disclose their tax file numbers to others. I believe that people will not have the opportunity not to do so under the method devised by the Opposition. It had a very limited view of where the tax file number will be used. I think, in fact, it is attempting to con the electorate as to where the tax file number is to be used because it was in agreement with the Government that it would be used in as many areas as it could possibly be used in. The fact that the Government, at the same time as it was negotiating with the Opposition, was preparing to introduce a Bill, which was introduced immediately the Government had the Opposition's agreement whereby the tax file number system would be compulsory for certain groups of people, shows that the Opposition was either incredibly naive or simply attempting yet again to mislead the electorate with regard to the operation of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the amendment moved by Senator Haines one sees that it is a simple proposition-one which we have used elsewhere and which I think would be readily acceptable by everybody in the community-whereby the obligation is on the individual to communicate with the Australian Taxation Office where a person has a tax liability, for example, from interest earned. Where that did not occur it is obvious that some types of penalties would have to apply. I believe that method is one that would overcome most, although not all, of the problems that exist in this area, and that those who wished would have the ability to do so without penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty of Senator Messner's proposition that the Government has accepted is that, as most people readily accept when they look at the figures, it is a little like a phrase that is often used with regard to the rights of individuals: that is, it is the right of both rich and poor to sleep under a bridge. There obviously is a massive distinction between people who do not have a roof over their head and their ability to sleep elsewhere and rich people's ability to organise themselves in such a way as not to suffer any penalty out of this exercise. It is not surprising that the Opposition looks after its rich mates. One comes to accept that type of proposition, but I should have thought the Government might have taken pause at the exercise and it may have been better to make sure that people, no matter what their income, were able to operate in a way that stays within the Government's original intention that the Taxation Office ought to know, when a person is employed, that person's address and tax file number, going together. Putting those two things together covers most, but not all, of the problems that may occur in the taxation area. </PARA>
<PARA> I should have thought it was equally simple for a person when opening a bank account or some other account from which interest might accrue, also to notify the Taxation Office that that account had been opened, and those two things could be linked. In other words, the tax file number would not have to be disclosed to any other group, and that is the important distinction between the approach that we have taken and the approach that the Opposition has taken. The tax file number would not have to be disclosed; it would provide, however, the same types of safeguards that the Government would be seeking so that people who had a tax liability would have to discharge it. </PARA>
<PARA> I go further to suggest that in a case when this information was not notified, it would then be up to the Taxation Office to investigate immediately, because quite a number of the areas will not be susceptible to legislation; they will only be susceptible ultimately to the Taxation Office having knowledge of an individual's activity, but for the Taxation Office to be able to cover those people it must obviously know where they are. The easiest way of triggering a number of those factors would be through the operations of a tax file number system which was operating effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the position that we have held all along, but unfortunately, the way the Government has now gone about it is to set up a context in which it will be compulsory for some; it will be optional for the rich, but it will certainly not be optional for people on low income levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of clause 6, I draw the attention of the chamber to proposed new section 202, which sets out the objects of the Bill. I would like to make some remarks concerning the higher education charge which Senator Macklin has been speaking of. Firstly, I make it absolutely clear that while we in the Opposition are giving our support to this legislation concerning tax file numbers, we are not implicitly or expressly giving our support to the Government's policy for the introduction of a higher education charge. We want to make it clear that no decision has been made by the Liberal and National parties on that question, because we have not yet received the legislation to discuss it. For that reason there can be no inference drawn from whatever is said or done in regard to this Bill today that we are lending support to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the main point of the amendments. I stated during the second reading debate that there were three criteria by which the Liberal and National parties determined their attitude on the question of support for this Bill. The first was whether the legislation would combat both tax and welfare fraud. The amendments which have been put forward by the Australian Democrats in turn have to be decided upon against those criteria. The Democrat amendments do not indeed assist the objective of seeking to bring down the curtain on tax and welfare fraud. In fact, it seems that the amendments would have the reverse effect of opening up the possibility for fraud to an even greater degree. I fear that the amendments fail, therefore, on that first ground by which the Liberal and National parties have determined their attitude. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps that will emerge when I get to the third point. Secondly, I come to the question of cost-effectiveness. There is no doubt that the system and proposal put forward by the Democrats in their amendments would lead to intolerable burdens of cost and of administrative kinds on both the private sector-employers, large and small-and upon financial institutions that are handling all the paperwork, to such an extent as to significantly change the balance of the card in favour of more costs rather than benefits, so unquestionably the amendments fail our second test and again give us reason not to support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third consideration which we set down against which we would judge support for the Bill was the question of civil liberties. We wanted to ensure that by our amendments both to this legislation, which have now been agreed to by the Government, and to the Privacy Bill, which have been negotiated by the shadow Attorney-General, we would be able to guarantee the confidentiality of one's tax file number and ensure that it could not be misused in the community without severe penalty. Those amendments have been incorporated into the tax file numbers Bill and will be incorporated in a moment when we get to the privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the amendments that the Australian Democrats are now proposing in relation to further freeing up or liberalising the use of the tax file number go a lot further by demonstrating that one's tax file number will become even more accessible to government agencies and to the private sector generally. It will thereby open up the very real possibility that confidentiality will be breached. The Liberal and National parties feel that to accept the proposals put forward by Senator Haines would be to provide a system where there would be pieces of paper floating around in the mail, on fax machines, or wherever, in absolutely immense numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities would exist, as they currently exist, and would multiply many times, for people to find out what a person's tax file number would be in such a way as it could then be exploited by computer hackers or by people who want to stick their noses into other people's business. That is perhaps the most dangerous part of the Democrats proposals. It obviously opens further opportunities for confidentiality of the tax file number to occur. Above all, that is the reason why we will not be giving our support to the Democrats proposals. I want to emphasise that final point again because I think it is quite obvious that the Democrats want to bury this proposed system in a mountain of paper so that it just cannot work. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, does not the Democrats amendment require letters to be going to and fro from commissioners of taxation to employers and financial institutions? Will they not have to quote numbers? Will there not be all kinds of opportunities to stick their noses into bits of paper and find out things about people? Of course they will and Senator Haines knows it. That is obviously what is going to be a direct result of what the Democrats are proposing. That appears to me to be putting not only an immense burden on the private sector but also allowing the possibility for the confidentiality that is well protected now by the privacy legislation to be breached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without going too much further on this subject I wish to make the point again that I believe that the Democrats amendment will spread paper around this community like confetti. There will be access to information available to persons wishing to find out about a person's affairs. For that reason we will not support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been in this place on and off for the last 11 years and I am used to listening to some fairly extraordinary arguments and speeches but this one probably takes the cake. One wonders what Senator Messner-who I understand before he entered this life was, in a previous existence, an accountant-thinks the group certificates do and are if they are not pieces of paper floating around between employers, employees, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and back again. We live under mountains of paper. The only change that has been made recently is that those bits of paper have been reduced somewhat because the banking sector and others have gone into computing systems. Instead of exchanging pieces of paper we have these little things that go beep in the night talking to each other. I find that last argument totally frivolous and non-convincing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner talks about the fact that the plethora of papers being exchanged between individuals and the Tax Office and the Tax Office and employees is somehow going to create huge opportunities for breaches of privilege, breaches of privacy and invasions of civil liberties. We already have that happening. We already have group certificates and other pieces of paper going from employers and institutions to employees and the Tax Office and back again. Photocopiers and fax machines are hard at work 24 hours a day in this country. This is neither going to worsen nor improve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the rest of the arguments put forward by Senator Messner, I wonder whether he has looked at his own amendment. He said, `They apply three criteria to see whether something is worthwhile supporting in this instance'. He said, `Will it combat tax and social security fraud?'. If that is the major criteria I do not have the faintest idea why he is supporting this legislation at all. It is not going to completely combat tax and social security fraud. As I said in the debate on the second reading there are already people in the community who are successfully operating two or more identities. They have two or more false tax file numbers. The benefits are that they will get two or more tax free thresholds and pay tax at a significantly lower marginal tax rate than they would normally if they declared all the income earned under a single name. Are they going to go on doing this under this piece of legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> If somebody is working in a day job and calling himself John Brown and quoting a tax file number that has been issued to him under that name at that address to the employer the employer will deduct tax at the appropriate marginal tax rate. If that same individual works nights calling himself Bill Smith and using the tax file number that was allocated by the Tax Office years ago when he started this little scam the second employer will deduct tax at the lower marginal tax rate. I am almost 100 per cent sure that there is no more chance of his being caught under this system than under the one that already exists. Why should there be? We might pick up people who have not got a tax file number because they have been working a scam with an employer or because they have money buried in bank accounts that they are not declaring. That can certainly be fixed up under our system. So to argue that anything which combats tax and social security fraud is something that has the Opposition's support is ridiculous. This Bill will not do that any way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner went on to say that the Democrats amendment does not `bring down the curtain on tax and other fraud'. Yet he has calmly negotiated with the Government a deal that lets high income earners off the hook completely providing they are prepared to pay for the privilege. Providing they are prepared to lose 50.25c in the dollar they can get off that particular hook. He then says that the next criterion was cost-effectiveness and that if the amendment that we have moved is carried it will cost the Tax Office and private institutions a lot of money. Again, what does he think is happening now and what does he think is going to happen when all these records have to be kept anyway? I will tell him what will happen: the costs will be imposed on the private sector and the people who will pay eventually will be the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks will pass on whatever costs the current legislation causes them. That is what banks are in the business of doing more and more these days. Any institution that can entice people to lend money to it and then charge them for the privilege of withdrawing that money will not think twice about passing on the costs of servicing the requirements under this legislation. The cost to the bank will probably be less if the account holders tell the Tax Office and the Tax Office alerts the bank instead of it happening the other way round. If Senator Messner sits there in some sort of blue-covered cloud-cuckoo-land believing that the current legislation, or even the current situation, is not increasing costs on the private or the public sector, I suggest he take a little peek through the curtain that he thinks he has brought down on tax fraud and look at the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's third concern was for the protection of civil liberties. Again, the deal that the Opposition has done with the Government protects some people's civil liberties: it protects the civil liberties of the wealthy who do not have to provide the information for a fee of 50.25 cents in the dollar. Those people can choose not to hand over their tax file number or numbers. As Senator Panizza indicated at the second reading stage, those people probably have three or four numbers legally. They do not need to quote all of those and risk crosschecking, invasion of privacy or leaking of information, but the rest of us do. Senator Messner seems to feel quite comfortable about that. He would protect the civil liberties of the John Elliotts and Alan Bonds of this world but ensure that everybody on the unemployment benefit, $20,000 a year or family allowances of some sort goes through this system. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment cannot be used to breach confidentiality. Quite the reverse is true. Senator Messner is saying that if one gives one's tax file number to a bank, confidentiality will be preserved; if one gives one's tax file number and all the other details to a private employer, confidentiality will be preserved: but, if one gives it to the Australian Tax Office, see what happens. The only difference between what we are saying should happen and what the Government is saying should happen is that some people, if they choose to do so, can give it to the Australian Taxation Office instead of an employer or institution. Somehow or other, Senator Messner believes that, if an individual talks to the Tax Office and the Tax Office talks to an institution, we will get civil liberties infringements that we will not get if an individual talks to an institution and the institution talks to the Tax Office. Come on! This is not playschool, for heaven's sake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tax Office is an institution which, of all institutions in this country, has pretty much the confidence of everybody because it has been able-admittedly, in its own interests-to maintain confidentiality. Where have the major breaches of privacy come from in the past? They have not come from the Australian Taxation Office's leaking of information, Mr Keating's late filing of a tax return notwithstanding. The major breaches of privacy come from the private sector-a sector which, I might point out, is not covered in the privacy legislation. People giving misinformation, information out of context or maliciously wrong information to, say credit bureaus in order to stop somebody getting a loan is an example. Those bits of information are not coming from the Tax Office: they are coming from the private sector. So do not try to tell us that if some individual informs the Tax Office who his employer is, what the details are and what his tax file number is-and he then gets the good housekeeping seal of approval from the ATO-somehow that information will be on the front page of a newspaper the next day. It is far more likely to happen the other way round. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment will do nothing to stop the Government combating tax and social security fraud. It will not worsen the cost problems already facing us in this country. It certainly will not increase in any way at all the paper war that goes on between institutions, and it goes far further to protect civil liberties for more people than that deal done between the Opposition and the Government to protect their rich mates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -On analysis, Senator Messner's proposition seemed to consist of three assertions and no examples. I invited him, by way of interjection, to give some examples which, of course, he singularly failed to do. I hope that he will come back into the debate with some concrete examples. The basis upon which the Opposition made up its mind on our amendment was its concern with three items, the first of which was social security and taxation fraud. If he had bothered to read our amendment he would have discovered that it in no way affects the operations or effectiveness of the Bill in that respect. Nothing in Senator Haines's amendment would do anything to lessen the Bill's ability to combat such things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our amendment deals exclusively with the way in which the Australian Taxation Office comes to know the tax file number of somebody who is an employee, the tax file number of a person who buys shares, the tax file number of a person who opens a bank account, and so on. In other words, our amendment deals exclusively with the interactive parts of information. It does not deal, and nor does it seek to do so, with those elements which would render the legislation either effective or ineffective. I reiterate Senator Haines's point that the Bill will stand or fall, with or without our amendment, in terms of whether it will be effective in these areas. Senator Haines said at the second reading stage, as have a number of speakers, that there are a number of areas in which it will do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> For our part we have been willing to support those types of movements ahead despite the fact that they do not solve all the problems in the world. Fascinatingly, the Opposition has often opposed propositions on the grounds that they do not solve all the problems in the world. The Australian Democrats have been happy to move, in an incremental way, to overcome problems and we have been supportive of a whole range of areas in the taxation system which the Opposition sought to vote against. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it excessively odd that Senator Messner should come in here and give us a pious little lecture about why the Opposition has reached the decision that it now advocates after opposing year after year taxation measures which were specifically designed-and they have been massively effective-to combat the fraud that has existed in the taxation area. One example of this is the fringe benefits tax. The Opposition sought to oppose proposals that were put forward in one of the greatest rort areas in the whole taxation area. The prescribed payments scheme is another example. So the pious little lectures from Senator Messner do not really wash at all. But, of course, Senator Messner has not read the Democrats' amendments so he does not know that they do not relate in any shape or form to the point he raised. Whether or not the Bill is effective will not be affected in any way by our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter raised by Senator Messner was cost effectiveness. The honourable senator again waved his arms and talked about mountains of paper. He referred to the concerns he has for his beloved private sector. I hope that what he said is useful in terms of any support that the Opposition may get in that area. But again the types of communications that are required by the private sector are not affected by our amendments. I invite Senator Messner, by way of response, to point to the part of our amendments which will increase impositions on the private sector. He might wish to do so by way of an example. He might even point to the part of our amendments that will do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that, even without our amendments, employers will have an obligation under the Bill. Currently, employers have an obligation to notify the Taxation Office when they employ somebody. That obligation is not going to be changed in any way by our amendments. Under our amendments an employee will be able to take on that obligation, if he wishes to do so, and proceed in a way that enables him to retain the confidentiality of the tax file number. In this way the information will not be available to the personnel branch. Personnel clerks, who do not have anything else to do when things are quiet on a Friday afternoon, and who may get out the files of a variety of people in order to get a bit of light entertainment will not be able to find out the numbers the amendments do say that an employee may communicate directly with the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner, having not read the amendments, presumably is not even bothering to listen either. That is probably fairly typical. By way of response, Senator Messner may in fact demonstrate where that mountain of paper is going to come from. Under our amendments, the Tax Office will be able to carry out the matching exercise and the Bill will operate in the intended way.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the most extraordinary statement was the third matter raised by Senator Messner about the decision that the Opposition had taken in regard to the protection of civil liberties. I think the area of civil liberties and tax is a difficult one for anybody to address. Undoubtedly, some liberties will be removed when the community seeks to impose a liability on an individual. I believe that the debate about civil liberties in our community should be one about the balance between those two items. That is not necessarily an easy balance to achieve. But I believe, other things being equal, that the preferred course is to achieve the same outcome without removing some of the liberties of an individual. I think that is what our amendments seek to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the opportunity to achieve the same result without everybody knowing a person's tax file number. We are seeking to allow the individual to assume responsibility for communicating information to the Tax Office. We believe-and our amendments recognise this-that it is not possible to do any more than that. It is up to the individual to decide whether or not he wants to follow that course. Our amendments do not seek to require people to disclose how much money they have. We wish to give people the opportunity to decide whether they desire to keep their tax file numbers to themselves and the Taxation Office or whether they are happy to have that information bandied around for all and sundry. I would imagine that a large number of people in our community would be quite happy to have their tax file numbers bandied around. It would not worry them in the least. On the other hand, it is clear that other people do care. If we can accommodate both of those wishes--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator Haines</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Haines said, they might want this information to be regarded as confidential, not because they are defrauders but for other reasons. If we can achieve the same result and satisfy both groups of people, I believe that that is the way to go. That is the intent behind our amendments. We believe that it is possible to satisfy both groups of people-those who are happy to have others know what their numbers are and those who, for whatever reason, and I do not think one has to impute an improper motive, do not wish that information to be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Off the top of my head, I can think of a number of reasons that are not improper motives. For example, I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform which was concerned with rewriting our electoral laws. We looked at, and in fact this Parliament enacted, a proposal to implement a secret confidential list on which an elector can apply to place his name rather than on an open roll. We did that because we know that electoral rolls are often used by private investigating agencies and others to track down individuals. I remember that the Committee was particularly concerned about cases such as that of a battered wife who does not wish her children or herself to be harassed by her husband. Such a person may have sought protection by changing her name, her accommodation and often the State in which she and her children are living. We said that such a person ought to be able to vote but that she should not have to do so in a way that places her in danger. That seems to me to be a perfectly good reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number will become a very useful piece of information which will undoubtedly end up in the hands of innumerable agencies. If this Bill is passed, I think that everybody will accept that that will occur. It is all very well to write various things into the legislation to try to stop this from happening. The only effective way of stopping the spread of this information is not to have it bandied about and this is what our amendments seek to do. Our amendments will ensure that people who, for good and proper reason, do not want information bandied about will have the opportunity to ensure that that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that each of the items that Senator Messner raised-the combating of social security fraud, cost effectiveness and civil libertarian issues-are maintained, enhanced or improved by our amendments. In particular, the civil liberties protection is definitely improved by our amendments. I think it is a pity that the Opposition has engaged in a grubby exercise in trading off whatever it is going to get out of the deal it has entered into-and I think we will probably see in due course, in terms of some other legislation, what it has managed to secure-against the protection of the liberties of individuals who do not wish to go down this line. I would have thought that there ought to have been a clearer approach from the Opposition spokesperson in this area based on the amendments circulated in the chamber. I hope that that will take place. </PARA>

<PARA>We have three series of amendments to the Privacy Bill. The first concerns a representative complaint and would have the effect of amending subparagraph 52 (1) (b) (iii) on page 33. It is basically concerned with the fact that, at the moment, where there is a representative complaint and somebody is acting on behalf of two or more complainants, it is not possible for a declaration to be made that the complainant is entitled to a specific amount by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered by reason of the act or practice the subject of the complaint. In other words, one of the remedies available to the Commissioner in the case of an individual complaint is not available in relation to a representative complaint, as the Bill stands at that moment. We in the Opposition cannot see why that remedy should not be so available. At the moment it is a disincentive to representative complaints when that might be the most efficient way in which to deal with a series of complaints arising our of the same circumstances. Therefore, our first series of amendments dealing with clause 52 (1) (b) (iii) is to that effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments moved by Senator Hill relate to the question of damages being available to an individual where one has a representative action. I draw the attention of the chamber to clause 39:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Nothing in this Part prevents a person from making a complaint under subsection 36 (1) about an act or practice about which a representative complaint has been made. </PARA>
<PARA>As the heading to that clause indicates, individual complainants are not to be precluded by representative complaints. It is just a simple analogy with what happens under sex and race discrimination legislation; that is, that a representative complaint can occur but an individual who wants to make a claim about the quantum of the compensation that should be awarded in his or her particular situation will just bring an individual complaint after the representative complaint has dealt with what is, after all, the most important issue, which is the changing of the act or practice which has given rise to the problem-the interference with privacy that might affect a range of people. We think that, the representative complaint being disposed of and the act or practice being changed and thereby the situation remedied, an individual complainant can then properly go through the process to get a tailored quantum compensation. Clause 39 is in the Bill for that particular purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were aware of clause 39 and our amendment does not seek to vary that clause. It would allow it to continue. In some circumstances, it might be appropriate for an individual complainant subsequently to move in the direction indicated by Senator Tate. That option is available and would remain available. But there may be other cases such as a matter which concerns a representative action of three complainants-it might be three individuals within a family-arising out of the same circumstances where the principle of any compensation would apply to each member of that family or group in the same way. It may seem to the Privacy Commissioner that there are circumstances in which he or she would want to award an equal amount of compensation to each of the three complainants. The most efficient way in which the matter could be disposed of would be to allow the Privacy Commissioner that option. All we are seeking to do is to add another option for the Privacy Commissioner. In some circumstances where it seems appropriate in the case of a representative complaint, he should have the option to provide compensation for any loss or damage suffered by reason of the act or practice, the subject of the complaint. Therefore, we are seeking to add another option to improve the flexibility available under the Act, and we see that as being of benefit to the community as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say very briefly that at this stage the Government is not prepared to accept the amendments. I can see some merit in what Senator Hill has to say, but I believe that at the moment we need to give more consideration to, for example, the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) on class actions and the mechanism that might be put in place to enable a distribution between individual members of the representative action. We shall look forward to the Privacy Commissioner reporting on it to this Parliament. When we have some experience of how it works and, as I say, in the light of the Government's consideration of the ALRC report, I would be very happy for us to undertake a review and perhaps try to build in the flexibility and the option that Senator Hill speaks of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There is no doubt, as I said during my speech at the second reading stage, that the Privacy Bill is deficient and requires improvement in a number of areas. Whilst it is long overdue, or perhaps because it is long overdue, we might just as well have, at the end of this exercise, the best piece of legislation that we can, a Bill with the fewest possible deficiencies, anomalies and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event I do not believe that this privacy legislation is going to be an adequate protection against misuse or abuse of the tax file number legislation. But since the arrangement has already been made between the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia and the Government-and as an ex-mathematician I can at least count; I know when the numbers are against me-we might just as well face the fact that we have now got in place the basis for a national identification system. We therefore need to come up with a piece of privacy legislation that is going to go as far as we in this place can make it go to protect people from all the problems that ensue from a national ID system. So while we have the legislation before us we might as well correct, however piecemeal or inadequate that correction might be, the anomalies and deficiencies in the legislation and insert the things that are missing which need to be placed in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about a matter that I brought to the attention of this Senate earlier this year following a letter that 31 members of the Senate wrote to the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mikhail Gorbachev, in February of this year. The 31 members of the Senate urged Mr Gorbachev to allow the Lithuanian and Estonian people to honour their national independence days peacefully and to take all necessary measures to guarantee that they do not become targets of state sponsored harassment as a result of these commemorations. That letter was forwarded to Mr Gorbachev, via the Russian Ambassador in Australia, on 19 February. We received an acknowledgment of the letter on 11 March 1988 from Mr Zemskov, the Minister-Counsellor with the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. He acknowledged receipt of the letter and said that the Embassy was asking the parliamentarians in Estonia and Lithuania to answer the message. At the same time, he refuted many of the facts that we stated in our letter to Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr Zemskov since then has achieved much more publicity and a higher profile in the Australian community following the assertions in the latest edition of the Reader's Digest that Mr Zemskov is a member of the elite KGB Special Reserve. I point out that the knowledge of his membership of the Special Reserve was well known to the Australian authorities and to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) before Mr Zemskov arrived in Australia in 1986. The advice of ASIO at that time in relation to Mr Zemskov was overridden and ignored by the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Soviet Embassy did forward the letters to the Estonian and Lithuanian parliamentarians. We have received no reply since that time from any parliamentarians in Estonia, but I have now received a reply from four deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The reply was in Russian but the parliamentarians were kind enough to provide an English translation. The letter is dated 10 May. It was posted to me direct from Lithuania. It arrived in a fine envelope with many fine looking stamps. The only problem was that it took about six months to arrive. It reached me only about two weeks ago, hence the delay in bringing it to the attention of the Senate. I do so now, and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the English version of the letter. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Short. </PARA>
<PARA> We have thoroughly studied Your letter you had addressed to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev on February 19, 1988. In your letter You urged the Soviet authorities not to take any measures which would have impeded to commemorate the Independence Day of Lithuania on February 16. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that on February 16, 1918, there has been signed a pact which led to the establishment of Lithuanian bourgeois state. This is an undisputable fact. But we would like to point out that the 10th of December is a proper day of Lithuania's independence. On that day the Soviet power was proclaimed in Vilnius, capital of the Lithuania. Regretfully, the Soviet power existed for a short while, it was suppressed by the occupational and local counterrevolutionary forces. According to the will of Lithuanian people the Soviet power was reestablished in 1940. The same year Lithuania entered the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Soviet power Lithuania with the assistance of all Soviet nations has changed from the backward agrarian appendage of the Western Europe in to the republic with highly developed industry, intensive agriculture and cherished culture. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to deny the fact that there is a small group of individuals who are dissenting with historical realities looking back to the bourgeois power in our republic. They are trying by various means, very often illegally, to attract the attention of Western mass-media, to win the support of foreign politicians. Of course, the handful of intriguers do not represent the interests of the people of Soviet Lithuania. Lithuanians condemn their activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The 16th of February was an ordinary working day, without any demonstrations and disturbances. By the way this could have been witnessed by western journalists visiting this day Vilnius. </PARA>
<PARA> By all means we have problems, as well as other nations which are heading towards progress. We are convinced that process of perestroika, the democratization of public life, glasnost will help to solve those problems in the spirit of constructive discussion. </PARA>

<PARA> It is true that on 16 February, 1918, there has been signed a pact which led to the establishment of Lithuanian bourgeois state. That is an indisputable fact.

I did so in my speech in this place on this matter in March of this year, and I will not repeat all of that, but I seek leave to have incorporated an information note supplied to me by the Lithuanian community in Melbourne on the whole question of the true Independence day of the Lithuanian state. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>LITHUANIAN COMMUNITY IN MELBOURNE</PARA>
<PARA>THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SO CALLED ``VOLUNTARY'' INCORPORATION OF THE BALTIC STATES INTO THE SOVIET UNION</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In the non-aggression treaty signed between the Republic of Lithuania and the Soviet Union on 12.7.20 the Soviet Government solemnly renounced in perpetuity claims to the territories belonging to Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 23.8.39 the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was signed in the presence of J. Stalin who proposed a toast to Adolf Hitler calling him ``molodiets''-a jolly good fellow. In the secret protocols of this treaty the two dictators divided Eastern Europe between them as follows: Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet spehere of influence and Lithuania to the Third Reich. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) After Lithuanian government refused Ribbentrop's invitation to declare war on Poland, a second secret protocol was signed between Moscow and Berlin on 28.9.39 leaving Lithuania also in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) On 26.9.39, two days before signing the second secret protocol, Molotov invited the Lithuanian foreign minister Urbsys to Moscow and offered him to sign a mutual defence treaty between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. Lithuania, Molotov insisted, should allow the Soviets to have their military bases in its territory. The Lithuanian minister refused to sign such a treaty incompatible with the sovereignty of his country and returned to Lithuania to inform his government about Moscow's strange demands. First of all the German ambassador to Lithuania, Mr Zechlin, was appealed to. He answered that the Third Reich couldn't do anything at all about the Soviet demands. No positive promises were received from other Western countries. For the first time the Lithuanian government understood the seriousness of the situation. On his second visit to Moscow on 7.10.39 Mr Urbsys offered a mutual assistance treaty but without the Soviet military bases. J. Stalin got impatient and interrupted the minister: ``you are arguing too much!''. The treaty had to be signed under Stalin's terms. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) On 14.6.40 Moscow gave ultimatum demanding that an unlimited number of Soviet troops were to be allowed to march into Lithuania. In addition, Mr Molotov warned that the Soviet troops would invade Lithuania whatever its answer to Moscow's ultimatum. The massive armed invasion took place before the ultimatum's time expired. </PARA>
<PARA>LITHUANIA AFTER THE OCCUPATION</PARA>
<PARA> (6) On July 2, 1940 Lithuanian prime minister V. Kreve-Mickevicius went to Moscow to speak with Mr Molotov making the last attempt to save Lithuania's independence. Mr Molotov was extremely frank. He told the Lithuanian minister: ``For centuries we dreamed of possessing the Baltic coast. Now we have the opportunity and we decided to use it. Lithuania together with the other Baltic States and Finland must be incorporated into the Soviet Union''. </PARA>
<PARA> Molotov explained how Moscow would legalize the incorporation and make it a ``voluntary'' one. ``Your people will be asked by Accepted Soviet Methods to enter into the family of the Soviet Union. You will see that before 4 months pass the Baltic States peoples will give their votes in favor of such an incorporation''. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) On 27.7.40 Molotov's announced general election in Soviet style took place. In strictly obligatory voting people had to vote for the only list prepared by the Communist party (it had 700 members in Lithuania, 3/4 of which were not of Lithuanian nationality) and Mr Dekanazov representing the invaders. As stated in a private conversation by the new Lithuanian president (named by Moscow's leadership) Mr J. Paleckis, 85% refused to vote. The puppet government informed the people that the election was highly successful with over 95% votes in favor of the candidates nominated by Moscow. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The simple fact is that Lithuania was illegally annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union, by Stalin, as a result of perhaps the most criminal of all secret pacts between countries-the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which annexed illegally the Baltic States to the Soviet Union. That annexation has been, with very few exceptions, completely ignored and rejected by the Western world, with the very unfortunate exception of a period under the Whitlam Government in the 1970s when de jure recognition was given. That recognition was repealed immediately on the election to government of the Fraser Ministry in 1975, and the Hawke Government has, thankfully, maintained that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The assertion that the will of the Lithuanian people as a whole is shown by the acceptance that Lithuania is now a legal part of the Soviet Union is a lie which must be continually rejected by the peoples of the free world. Otherwise we will continue, as a Western free world, to be beguiled by the attempts to rewrite history by the Soviet Union over many years. Whilst I welcome the apparent move in the Soviet Union towards a greater openness, a greater frankness and a greater and more meaningful relationship with the Western world through the policies of glasnost and perestroika, I believe that it is far too early to be taking policies and approaches at face value. If we do so without putting the Soviet Union to the test-a very meaningful test on the policies that it is now pursuing, a test of its bona fides-as to whether it wants a peaceful, constructive working relationship with the Western world, to the benefit of all nations on earth, I believe very sincerely and very strongly that we will fall into the trap of being beguiled by sweet siren words which we have heard before, and policies which we have seen adopted before and which did not last very long. Whilst I am very hopeful, and very pleased to see the developments that are occurring in the Soviet Union, I think that under no circumstances should we allow the Soviet Union in this era of greater openness to attempt to make the re-write of history that I believe the reply we have received from the parliamentarians of Lithuania implies. The concluding paragraph of the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>On this occasion we would like to express the respect to you and the people of Australia. We would like to extend an invitation to the parliamentarians of Australia to visit our republic in order to have a close look at the life of the people of Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an invitation that I look forward, hopefully, to accepting one day. I know that some of our colleagues have been on similar tours, but mainly organised through the Soviet Union at the central level. I find it very interesting that this invitation has come in the way that it has, and I hope that it is an invitation that we as senators will look at very closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday evening, at my invitation, His Excellency the Ambassador for Greece came to Parliament House to talk to senators and members of the House of Representatives regarding the bid by Athens to host the 1996 Olympic Games. As honourable senators, particularly those from the eastern States, are no doubt aware, three cities-Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne- are currently bidding to be the Australian contender for those Games. The round of negotiations within Australia should be completed within a couple of weeks, when one of those cities will be chosen by the Australian Olympic Federation to be the contender in the run-up to the decision being made in Tokyo in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important when one looks at this issue to reflect somewhat on the Games of 1896. Athens was chosen by the International Olympic Committee, which had been established at that time. The decision was made in 1894 that Athens would be the city to host the first of the revived Olympic Games. Athens at that stage was a town of about 50,000 people, quite a small town by anyone's standards. But one also remembers that the vast bulk of people then on the International Olympic Committee were people from France and Britain. Admittedly, it did have as a Chairman a very distinguished Greek citizen; nevertheless-numbers being what they are in sport or in politics-the overwhelming numbers on that committee would have been able, if they so chose, to allow London or Paris, the most splendid and important cities of the time, to host the first of the revived Olympic Games. Members of the Committee, however, had the enormous foresight to look beyond the immediate advantage to their own cities of Paris and London and instead choose Athens, a small country town, to be the city to host the revived Games. In doing so, they were recognising the unique contribution that Greece has made to world sport and, in particular, to the Olympic Games. It was not only a recognition; it was an acknowledgment of the central role played by Greece in that very important international event. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me, therefore-I have expressed this view publicly and in this place-that it is fitting for Athens to be the venue of the 1996 Olympic Games. I acknowledge that it runs counter to bids being made by the city in which I live and of which I am proud to be a citizen, and by other Australian cities, but I believe that on this occasion we need to take an international view. We need not to be miserly in our attitude. Australia, of all countries, is known around the world for being a generous and fair country. I think this is one of those occasions when we should employ that fairness and that generosity. The hosting of the golden Olympics, the hundredth anniversary Olympics, quite rightly ought to be the prerogative and the privilege of Athens. This is not just because it will be the hundredth anniversary, though that to my mind is an extremely important reason. </PARA>
<PARA> I am mindful of the fact that my own city of Brisbane was chosen to host a very successful World Expo 88. One of the reasons why the international community decided that an Australian city should be the host of the World Expo was obviously our bicentenary. The international community was saying to Australia, `We wish to share in your celebrations'. I think, when the international community is willing to do that for us, we ought in our turn, where we have the opportunity, reciprocate. This is one of those opportunities. The next Olympics will mark the hundredth anniversary, and the Olympic spirit first arose in Greece, where those games were first held and celebrated and when even wars were put aside so that people could contend in a peaceful way, bringing together not only physical strength and prowess but also, in the Olympic spirit, culture and art. But, over and above those reasons, there is another very important one. The Greek bid has been expressed in terms which are unique to Greece. It is not that it wishes to hold yet another Olympic Games in the fourth year after the Games in Barcellona, but that it wishes to raise in people's consciousness the reason for having such Games and to have people look back to the original purpose and intent behind the Games. As Greece has made clear, the original intent was not to stage a world event to sell sports goods or to advertise multinational logos. On the other hand, it was an international event to bring out the physical, the spiritual and the artistic qualities of the human race so that for a short period we would celebrate the achievements of the human race and not necessarily the types of things that divide us. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the extraordinarily beautiful, all marble Panathenaic Stadium, which was so impressively restored at extraordinary expense in 1896 on land that had originally been donated by an Athenian citizen to the world community for the hosting of such games, which saw the first event of the revived Olympics and which saw the end of the first revived marathon, should also see the entry of the Olympic torch in 1996. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter which I regard as very serious indeed. It is an example of what I think is bureaucracy gone mad. It relates to the operations of the Child Support Agency which has recently been established under the Child Support Act 1988. The motivation for the establishment of the Agency is well known. There have been a significant number of persons in default under maintenance orders and as a result it was thought desirable that an agency be established within the Australian Taxation Office to be responsible for the collection of maintenance payments, which it would then remit to the Department of Social Security, which in turn would be responsible for making the payments to the beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scandal and the outrage of the actual method of operation is that there will be a delay of up to eight weeks between the time the new system comes into operation and the time people receive their maintenance payments. For any maintenance orders made after 1 June 1988 it will be compulsory for a beneficiary to register with the Agency and the Agency will then be responsible for the collection of moneys. At the moment attempts are being made to coerce those whose maintenance orders were made prior to 1 June into being voluntary registrants. Whether or not they remain voluntary is another matter, because high level negotiations are going on between the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, and I imagine, all of the State Premiers. Certainly, in Victoria, Mr Cain is in active negotiation with his Federal colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider what this means in practice. I put to the Senate an example of a constituent of mine who for some years has been in receipt of maintenance payments of $260.89 per month. As a result of the new scheme she has been told that she must register and that there will then be a two-month delay, during which period she will not receive any maintenance moneys. She has always received her moneys through the clerk of courts and there has been about a 24-hour turnaround. Her ex-husband pays the moneys to the clerk of courts, they are receipted and processed and a cheque goes out to her straightaway. She has been getting that money on a regular basis for a long time, but now she is told that for an eight-week period she will be denied maintenance payments. This is all for the sake of suiting the bureaucracy, which is trying to impose this solution across the board, no doubt to catch up with the 70 per cent of maintenance orders that are not properly or fully enforced, at the expense of the 30 per cent who are in receipt of maintenance payments on a regular basis, and in respect of whom people are not in default at all. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent is a classic victim of a bureaucratic fix that has gone wrong. She is not going to get that money during the eight-week period, and it will not be made up until the very end of the maintenance order. Those with young children will not get that money until the children turn 16. That is an outrage. There is no justification for it. The Department suggests that the moneys will be paid into a trust fund established under section 74 of the Act. My examination of that section does not reveal any mention of whether interest is to attach to the fund, but undoubtedly it will. Section 74 does not say what will happen to any profits that are made but, undoubtedly, the surplus funds will be available to be used to pay for the costs of the establishment of the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have any precise figures but I am told that to date some 10,000 people have already registered with the Agency. If they were receiving an average of $60 a week, according to my calculations over that eight-week gap the Agency would be looking at some $5m. Obviously, the period of delay will vary from case to case, but if we are talking about more than 10,000 people being deprived for up to eight weeks of an average of $60 a week, we are talking moneys that will be available to the Govenment for a period of years. The interest payments that will then accrue will be retained by the Government for its own purposes and denied to the real recipients-those entitled to the payments. I think that is scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA> I would very much like to be told that this interpretation is wrong, but we have made inquiries from the Agency, from the Minister's office and from the Department. They all confirm that the system is designed to punish the 70 per cent or thereabouts who do not fully comply with their orders. It will clearly disadvantage those who are getting regular payments. That is simply not good enough. Millions of dollars are to be held wrongly by the Government at the expense of those who are very much entitled to them. I do not need to spell out the real hardship that will flow to those who have children for whom these moneys are paid, who suddenly find that over Christmas they will be completely out of pocket. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent does not work. She has relied heavily on $60 a week, or $260 a month, for her two children. She is unable to work because of a car accident. She suddenly finds that she is going to be completely without this money for a period of eight weeks and that, as a consolation prize, once the orders finally expire, in many years to come, a one-off payment will be made amounting to that sum. There is no mention of interest accrued; entitlement is simply to be deferred for a period of years to satisfy some crazy bureaucratic solution to a problem. I regard it not only as ham-fisted but also as manifestly unfair. I call on the Government to take urgent steps to ensure that those who are already struggling to make ends meet do not have to put up with such an unfair solution. Those who have no quarrel with the way in which the system has previously operated, who have been getting their moneys on a regular basis, should not be compelled to move to another scheme that will put them very much at a disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Bill. Therefore, it is not my intention to keep the Senate long, but there are a few points that we believe are of particular importance and should be stated. The Bill is to give effect to the most recent recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal on salaries and allowances for judges and the President and members of the Inter-State Commission. The Tribunal's recommendations follow its 1987 review of the remuneration and allowances of justices and judges and the new rates of salary are proposed to take effect from 1 January 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point that should be made is our concern and, not surprisingly, the concern of the judiciary about the long delay in the presentation of this matter to the Parliament. As I understand it, the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal was received by the Government in February. It has taken until now to bring this Bill to the Senate. It was not introduced into the House of Representatives until August of this year and, although the figures will be backdated, I remind the Senate that the Bill provides that the Act shall be taken to have commenced on 2 December 1987. Although the figures will be backdated, it seems to us to be a most unsatisfactory way of dealing with increases in allowances for two judges and other members of the judiciary. I would hope that, while this Government remains in office, it might deal with these matters more promptly in future. If it does that it might find that there is less dissatisfaction on the part of the judiciary. The rising levels of dissatisfaction on the part of members of the judiciary in relation to a number of matters is a matter of concern to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wanted to make is related to that matter. I refer to the concern of the judiciary that under the second tier increase the Government has, in effect, determined that it is satisfied that there have been changes to practices and procedures in the courts, and therefore increased efficiency and greater productivity, to justify that second tier adjustment. This is something of a sham. The Remuneration Tribunal itself acknowledged that it was inappropriate to work out the adjustment to judges' salaries on that basis, but it has been necessary for the Government to fit this area within its overall practice and therefore that sham has developed. Nevertheless, it has received criticism, from the judiciary and from the Law Council of Australia and, we believe, reasonably so. It is important that the standards of justice are maintained rather than that so many judgments, for example, be written within a given week. I refer the Senate to the criticism of the President of the Law Council, Denis Byrne, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course judges have a duty to be efficient and expeditious, but they have an over-riding duty to perform their work with the greatest care, and they must be free from any pressure that would interfere with their ability to act in that way. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the chamber would support that sentiment. The third matter that I want to mention, which is also of concern, is the overall question of the level of judicial salaries. This is causing considerable concern not only to the judiciary but to all those who are seriously interested in the administration of justice in this country. Honourable senators will no doubt be aware of the concerns that were expressed by Sir Anthony Mason at the recent conference of the Australian legal profession in Canberra. These concerns have been expressed by a number of judges and reported in the press, and have been made known to the Remuneration Tribunal. It is quite clear that the salaries of the judiciary are falling a long way behind the salaries of senior barristers. Nobody suggests that the salaries--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people in the community do better than we do. That is irrelevant to this debate. There is no suggestion that judges' salaries should strictly equate to those of senior members of the Bar; nevertheless, if they fall too far behind it is obviously a disincentive to go to the Bench. We on this side of the chamber believe that the best within the legal profession go to the Bench in order that the standards of justice in this country might be maintained and ever enhanced. There has been experience in recent times of judges retiring and going back to the Bar. That is a concern to the extent that it is being done because of the very significant shortfalls in the remuneration level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber urge the Government to look seriously at the question of the appropriate level of judicial salaries. We look forward to the pending determination of the Remuneration Tribunal on the subject of judicial salaries generally, and we hope that when we have that information and, as a result, more material on the table, this debate might be continued, with the result that judges, particularly Federal judges, who see their salaries falling considerably behind those of State judges, find this shortfall redressed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we support the Bill. It is important that the independence of the judiciary should be maintained and that is why Parliament, and not the Executive, is given the responsibility of fixing these salaries. We urge the Government to reconsider the level of judicial salaries because we believe that the existing shortfall means a loss to the community as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hill for his remarks. The Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Amendment Bill, as he has said, implements the recommendations made by the Remuneration Tribunal in its 1987 review concerning the remuneration and allowances of the Federal judiciary, including persons who, by virtue of an Act, have the same status as a judge, and the President and members of the Inter-State Commission. It provides for a 3 per cent second-tier salary increase and adjustments to various allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make recommendations only in regard to the remuneration of the Federal judiciary and related officers. This differentiates judges from other groups within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; that is, secretaries of Government departments, statutory office holders and parliamentarians whose remuneration is determined by the Tribunal. The fact that the Remuneration Tribunal does not have the power to make legally binding determinations in respect of judicial remuneration has meant that judicial salaries and allowances must be implemented by legislation. This necessarily creates delays for judges in receiving their appropriate entitlements and consumes the time of Parliament in debating the required amendments to the relevant Act. This is indeed a point that Senator Hill mentioned in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that it is the view of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that there is no constitutional constraint on the Remuneration Tribunals Act being amended to give the Tribunal determination-making powers in respect of the judiciary. The Government considers that this would be a desirable step and would eliminate, to a large extent, delays that have taken place in the past in implementing increases to rates of salary and allowances payable to the Federal judiciary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a point I feel strongly about, but I will not respond to it in the context of the judiciaries Bill. It would also ensure that the remuneration of the judiciary is fixed in a manner consistent with that applicable to other groups within the Tribunal's jurisdiction and other senior public sector groups whose remunerations are fixed by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is the Government's current intention to legislate in 1989 to enable determinations to be made and thus eliminate the necessity for legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill raised in his remarks a matter which I think it might be appropriate for me to comment on, and that was the application of national wage fixing principles in the consideration of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal, in setting the salaries and allowances of the groups within its jurisdiction-all of those classifications of groups that I have referred to-is required to have regard to the national wage principles and decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Whilst all of the provisions of the Commission's decisions may not, in their literal terms, be applicable to groups within the Tribunal's jurisdiction, it is nevertheless appropriate to apply them where feasible and to observe the intent and spirit of the Commission's decisions and principles. I do not believe that the setting of judicial remuneration in a manner consistent with that applicable to members of the work force generally has the effect or even the potential to infringe judicial independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 1988. This Bill has been introduced for several purposes. Firstly, it increases the level of penalties for offences which are already in place but the penalties for which have not been reviewed for many years. Secondly, it transfers the definitions of various offences from the regulations into the principal Act. Thirdly, it allows inspectors, who are generally officers of the Government of Queensland, to pursue offenders outside the limits of the park provided that the pursuit commenced within the park and provided that no regular police officer is available, thereby extending the doctrine of hot pursuit on the high seas. Fourthly, it permits the Minister to take remedial action to repair damage done to the park and then to recover the cost of such action from any party or corporation which may have been responsible for causing the original damage, and to have the capacity to enforce this repayment through the courts. Fifthly, it allows the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to invest its surplus funds, which will come primarily from the operations of the aquarium at Townsville, in investments which have been approved by the Treasurer. Finally, it allows the Authority to provide its expertise to other bodies or institutions subject to the approval of the Minister and, if appropriate, to provide them on a commercial fee-for-service basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this piece of legislation. The increase in penalties is to be welcomed. They are generally set at the level of a maximum of $10,000 for individuals and $50,000 for corporations. They cover such things as breaches of conditions of permits. These things have always been offences but have been provided for under the regulations. There are new and heavy penalties of up to a quarter of a million dollars for the dumping of prescribed matter, and especially for the dumping of dangerous wastes, and these are generally in line with the penalties in similar pieces of environmental legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the power of inspectors to undertake hot pursuit on the high seas is being extended. At present, any pursuit which commences in the park must halt when the offender being pursued leaves the park. The new regime allows the park inspectors to continue their pursuit provided it commenced in the park, it has been uninterrupted since it commenced and, in addition, a police officer is unavailable. Generally, one would have thought, police officers, unless they are hanging about on the reef for no particular purpose, are unlikely to be available to continue a pursuit which has commenced in the park when the offender leaves the boundaries of the park. Therefore this is an entirely reasonable proposition, although I propose to say something about what I think is one of the pieces of nonsense in the legislation in relation to this matter at a later stage. The inspectors, as I said, are nearly always employees of the Government of Queensland, and I understand that the State Government of Queensland supports this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may now, under this legislation, take steps to repair damage and recover the appropriate costs from offenders. This clarifies a power which it is believed has always existed in common law dealing with trespass and damage. The system is underpinned by the issue of injunctions and enforcement orders by the normal process in the courts. The Authority is to be given the power to invest its surplus funds-that is now a widespread provision for like authorities under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth-and the Bill allows the Authority to make its undoubted expertise available outside the Federal Government. Where appropriate, this will be on a contract fee-for-service basis. Such arrangements must be approved by the Minister and cannot be approved if they might, in the words of the legislation, `affect adversely the performance of the functions of the Authority'. Again, that has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that back in 1981 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment dealt with the question of the adequacy of the legislation affecting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in general, and made recommendations which have been largely taken up in this Bill. So this Bill responds to some previous comments and queries raised by the House of Representatives in that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise a couple of minor matters in relation to the Bill, which contains an interesting redefinition of the reef to include what are referred to in the legislation as bommie fields, reef slopes, moats and ramparts. When the triticale legislation was introduced earlier today, there were massive looks of disbelief around the place as to what exactly it was that was being provided for by way of levy. Indeed--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a cross between wheat and rye, for the honourable senator's information. It reminds me of the first occasion that I was introduced to a `field of rape'. The bommie fields, I understand, are groups of crowns of corals which are not joined. Moats, ramparts and reef slopes and other things which are provided for in the legislation extend the definition of the term `reef', although I understand this does not apply for what are commonly called, in that area, `sandy flats'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention very briefly to an example of one of the sorts of nonsenses that we are starting to get into legislation. I refer to the powers that inspectors are to be provided with under section 46a (3), which deals with taking people into custody and conducting searches. We have the following extraordinary piece of draftsmanship:</PARA>
<PARA>An inspector who conducts a search under this section shall not use more force, or subject a person to greater indignity, than is reasonable and necessary in order to conduct the search. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of what subjects a person to greater indignity than is reasonable, given that force can be used provided it is not more force than is reasonable and necessary, seems to me to be the sort of thing that is now creeping into legislation. Frankly, I believe that the attempt to write what, after all, are basically questions of commonsense, into legislative form, is really getting a little out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention in particular, and I commend the Government for having taken this action, the capacity which this legislation gives for action to be taken against people who cause damage to the reef. There is, for instance, a matter under way at the moment concerning a floating pontoon-Fantasy Island, I think was the matter in question-put there in order to provide public entertainment. The thing was erected, no doubt at some cost, and promptly sank. It is now sitting around on the seabed. The owner of the pontoon undertook to have it removed by 3 September this year. I understand that the pontoon has not been removed and, indeed, that it is unlikely to be removed by the end of the year. It is my understanding that it is not the intention of the Authority to allow the pontoon to be refloated and to remain within the park. I hope that, given this new piece of legislation, the Government will be quite vigilant in taking action against the owner of this particular facility if damage is done and there are remedial costs to be borne in removing the item from the area. This is an important addition to the power provided to the Authority, and one which is welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise, however, one other matter on which the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) may be in a position to give some advice. A report appeared in the Australian newspaper in September of this year that a reasonable size ammunition dump had been discovered off the John Brewer Reef, just 75 kilometres or so off Townsville. Although it was believed that there was no immediate danger, there is certainly a prospective danger of an explosion among the 100 tonnes of unexploded ammunition which is there. I would be interested to know whether anybody has any direct responsibility for that and whether any steps are being undertaken to render it less hazardous or, indeed to remove the ammunition dump. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that I make is that, in the course of the hearings of Estimates Committee D this year, I raised with Mr Kelleher, the Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, some details about the success of the aquarium which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, as a Queensland senator, would undoubtedly be familiar with. That aquarium, which last year, I believe, won the award for the best tourist facility in Queensland, had some 311,000 people passing through it in the last year. I have not had the opportunity to visit it yet, but I propose to do so on Tuesday of next week. The revenue which has been generated from that will now be capable of being invested by the Authority. I believe, from what I understand of the facility to date, that it is to be congratulated on the development which has taken place and the attempt to ensure that, at least in this instance, the integration of tourism and environmental protection is handled in an appropriate and proper fashion. It is my pleasure on behalf of the Opposition therefore, to lend our support to this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be necessary for me to go into the analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. Senator Puplick has done that quite adequately. He is well able to understand environmental matters; he is just, seemingly, incapable of doing anything to control his friends in the resource rip-off industries when it comes to environmental protection. I do not see any major problems with this Bill. In fact, some of the proposed provisions are long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick brought up the issue of Fantasy Island, a bizarre proposal which was basically a bunch of mobile homes arranged in a doughnut shape with palm trees protruding at intervals and which, of course, sank in a strong wind. This Fantasy Island fiasco may have prompted the clauses dealing with the removal of wreckage. The owner, Dough Tarca, claims that it will cost $268,000 to shift the remains and has used the defence that the wreck is a great place for fishing and diving. He is also having fights with his insurers, who do not want to pay. Anything that will prevent such a situation from happening in the future, of course, is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Another project is mooted for the Barrier Reef which could cause environmental difficulties even if it does not sink-and, of course, if it has the same fate as Doug Tarca's Fantasy Island it could be a disaster. I refer to the P and O proposal for a pontoon and day visits to Masthead Island. Masthead Island is a very important part of the Great Barrier Reef. It was declared a national park in June of this year. Geoff Muntz, the Queensland Minister for Environment, Conservation and Tourism, gave a press release on 30 June 1988 in which he summarised the island's major environmental attributes as follows: the second largest coral cay on the Barrier Reef; the second largest pisonia forest in Australia and one of the last forests of this tree in the world remaining intact; the second largest wedge-tailed shearwater colony in eastern Australia, with up to 60,000 birds, and a major Pacific Ocean colony; the second largest black noddy colony in Australia, with up to 17,000 birds, and a major Indo-Pacific colony of this species; the largest colony of roseate terns, globally threatened species, in eastern Australia; the principal nesting site for green turtles; and an important nesting site for white capped noddies, crested terns, bridled terns, blacknaped terns and colonies of lesser crested terns and eastern reef egrets. </PARA>
<PARA> The island is currently managed as a wilderness camping area, with camping limited to approximately 3,000 people per annum. There is a complete ban on motor driven appliances, and the total capacity is limited to 30 people at one time in the summer and 60 at one time in the winter. That is all very fine. It shows that the present plan is meant to allow people to visit the island and see it without doing undue damage. However, the P and O proposal is for a floating pontoon which is 45 metres long by 16 metres wide-that is a big floating pontoon-to be anchored off the reef flat to the north-west of the western end of the island. Daytrippers would be unloaded from the Heron Island fast cat in the morning and picked up in the afternoon. There would be an underwater viewing platform and glass bottom boats, and other activities such as snorkelling, diving and reef walking would be pursued. Access to the island would be restricted to small parties under the supervision of a guide, according to the proposal. The Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service has apparently conceded to a six-month test period for this access. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this proposal should be vigorously opposed. Masthead Island has a high natural value because of the number and size of the nesting colonies of birds, the vegetation, the turtle rookers and the surrounding platform reef, as has been admitted by the Queensland Government. Masthead should be retained as a low-key recreation area and have access restricted during periods of high nesting numbers. It will be very difficult to restrict visitor numbers to the island, particularly if 100 seasick passengers are unloaded onto a pontoon which rocks. They will want to go ashore. How will one keep them from going ashore, and who will keep them from doing so? P and O could provide adequate day visitor facilities on Heron Island or, alternatively, it could locate a pontoon on one of the reefs which does not have a coral cay. </PARA>
<PARA> P and O intends to dispose of sewage by on-board treatment and disposal on site. This is utterly appalling. There is no arrangement for the treatment of water from showers and washing facilities associated with catering. Again, this is utterly appalling. We are talking about a national park, about the Great Barrier Reef. Yet P and O wishes to dispose of sewage and waste water. Under many wind and tide conditions the site is dangerous for inexperienced swimmers and snorkellers. It is intended to moor the pontoon using four anchors, each at the end of 110 metres of chain-the size of a football field. The company says that it will move live coral to allow these chains to rest on the bottom without damage. However, the chains will be subject to considerable movement during a heavy swell and reasonable winds and will stir up sediments. These heavy mooring chains will disturb the bottom. An analysis of this proposal clearly demonstrates that the pontoon will not withstand a big cyclone and will have to be sunk in situ to limit damage to it and its surroundings. If the winds get strong they will sink the barge, and then, hopefully, they can raise it again. Environmentally destructive activities such as fish feeding and reef walking are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other reasons-many complex reasons-why this proposal should not go ahead, but I think I have outlined the major ones. I do not wish to delay the Senate any longer. I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and his Government to take a good hard look at the P and O proposal for the pontoon on Masthead Island. If it goes ahead it will further degrade one of Australia's greatest natural assets and one of its greatest tourist assets, the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not see any rivalry. That is the point. This is the Third Hawke Government, we are entirely united, unlike, I would observe, if I were to make a political speech, the Opposition. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill proposes the following amendments: to incorporate into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act a number of offences currently in the regulations, with an associated increase in penalties; revised clauses on declaration of pecuniary interests, which flowed from the recommendations of the 1979 Bowen committee; to empower the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority or interested third parties to seek injunctions; and the recovery of costs in rectifying damage flowing from a breach of the Act and payment of the reasonable costs of rehabilitation and restoration. It will also allow the Authority to provide assistance to other outside organisations and a number of other amendments to bring the Act into line with current drafting practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that this chamber, often sharply and heatedly divided, is heatedly in agreement that this Bill should go through. I thank the Opposition spokesman for the environment, Senator Puplick, and the Australian Democrats spokesman for the environment, Senator Norm Sanders, for concurring that this Bill will have undisputed passage. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of comments have been made in the speeches by the two spokespeople for the other two parties. I first turn to the question of Fantasy Island. As Senator Puplick and Senator Sanders have observed, Fantasy Island, a tourist pontoon floating adjacent to the floating hotel, has sunk. It broke up and sank in high winds on the night of 30 May. Although there were a number of staff on board at the time there was no death or injury. No environmental damage has been done as yet and it is not in the opinion of the Department or, indeed, of anyone, I think, a navigational hazard. The wreckage is resting on the seabed in about eight metres of water. The operator of the pontoon, Reeflink Pty Ltd, was directed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to remove the structure from the marine park by 3 September. Some material has been salvaged but the operator has failed to meet that deadline and has sought an extension of time to remove the wreckage. The Government shares the anxiety and concern expressed by both speakers in this debate, and we want to see the thing removed as quickly as possible and at no cost, of course, to the Commonwealth. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has sought legal advice from the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) on how that might be expedited if it is necessary to take steps to expedite it, and at this point I cannot comment further pending the outcome of the Attorney-General's considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter raised by Senator Puplick was the ammunition dump that has been found in the marine park. This is on the John Brewer Reef near the floating hotel. I think Senator Puplick said it was reported in the Australian in September of this year. He asked what we were doing about it and how it could best be dealt with. An unexploded World War II ordnance has been discovered adjacent to the outside perimeter of the John Brewer Reef. It was apparently dumped at the reef during 1945 and 1946, after the hostilities in the war had ended. Both the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, and Senator Richardson have been kept fully informed of the matter. On the discovery of the dumps the Royal Australian Navy immediately declared the area to be `foul ground', and the public has been warned to keep clear. The Chief of the Defence Force has directed a Navy clearance diving team to survey the area. They report that there are 12 dumps of ordnance, comprising a mixture of anti-tank mines, artillery shells and machine gun and rifle ammunition. The dumps are partly buried in sand, are coral encrusted, lie in water depths between 20 and 31 metres, and vary in distance from 950 to 2,600 metres from the floating hotel. The condition of the ordnance has not been established, but it is not likely to constitute a hazard as long as it remains undisturbed.</PARA>

<PARA> Further technical examination and assessment is being organised by the Department of Defence to determine the exact condition of the ordnance and to assist in assessments of options for subsequent action. No doubt it is calling for volunteers. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the operator of the floating hotel are being kept informed. In summary, we should say that the Defence Department has got the matter in hand and, consistent with the need to remove the ammunition, is dealing with it as well as one could expect in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders raised a question about a pontoon proposal from P and O in the proximity of Masthead Island. I am informed that an application on that matter has been received and is being processed. The proposal is subject to a public environmental report, a PER. Under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the Marine Park Authority is waiting to receive advice from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Territories and Tourism before commenting further. The PER should review all the possible impacts and effects that have been referred to in Senator Sanders's speech and, indeed, all the possible impacts and effects that would relate to the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to the Prime Minister's recent description of the award restructuring process as `massive' and `dramatic' and also to the Government's submission to the last national wage case which stated that award restructuring should not be restricted to a revision of job classification structures and should include working time arrangements. I also refer the Minister to a recent circular to all Australian Council of Trade Unions unions from the secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, which makes it clear that the ACTU position is to `keep the issues confined to skill formation, classification structures, related training requirements and associated wage rates'. Does the Minister agree that the ACTU position contradicts the decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that all matters in awards that affect industry's competitive requirements should be reviewed, including working time arrangements, and indeed that the ACTU's position contradicts the Government's position? What action will the Government take to ensure that the ACTU does not sabotage award restructuring negotiations, and how will it ensure that all matters affecting industry competitiveness are on the agenda?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question of the ACTU sabotaging award restructuring negotiations. The ACTU invented it. It was not industry or management that invented it, but the ACTU. It is very committed to it. The ACTU has had to take along with it, in the view that there should be restructuring of classifications and so on, a considerable number of employers and employer bodies. I think that there is now a consensus about the importance of that. In so far as the last decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission contains the phrase that negotiations should not be restricted and should deal, among other issues, with all matters including working time, that is a decision of the Commission and when the Commission reconvenes next year it will be asking the parties what they have done about these issues. The Commission, I think, will not in any way be confining its observations from what it said in the last national wage case hearing about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the ACTU puts out a circular about negotiating strategies and lays emphasis on particular matters, I do not see that as being inconsistent with the Commission's decision. The issue of time worked, for example, embraces an issue such as whether it is much better for people to work a four-day working week of 12-hour shifts rather than a working week of five days with eight-hour shifts, and so on. That is happening in a lot of places and with union agreement-people working 12-hour shifts for four days. I think it is a very important issue, particularly in capital intensive industries where machinery should be used as much as possible around the clock. I do not see any inconsistency in what Senator Chaney has dug out of an ACTU circular to unions and what the Arbitration Commission said in the course of its last hearing. All these things involve a process of change, negotiation and reaching a sensible position in which both sides from time to time have to be accommodating.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Royal Australian Mint, as I stated in answering a question from Senator Maguire on this topic a couple of years ago, is actively seeking contracts to print coins for other countries and is working through Austrade and its own marketing initiatives at present to get contracts for minting coins for Middle Eastern countries. The Mint this year sought and obtained a contract to make New Zealand's 1988 requirements, which involved a total production of 61 million coins and for which the contract price was just over $4.5m. Also, the Mint is seeking the contract to produce New Zealand's 1989 requirements, including the new $1 and $2 coins which the New Zealand Government has recently announced will be introduced. Therefore, the 1989 contract, if it is secured, is expected to be worth over $6m for around 100 million coins. The Mint is also seeking a small order for 1989 from Tokelau, as well as producing in 1988 smaller numbers of coins for the Cook Islands, Western Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. In addition to those circulating coin orders, the Mint has produced collector and numismatic coins for these countries. That work has been done by the Mint this year in spite of the heavy domestic requirements on its capacity, including the minting of the $2 coin and the bicentennial coin collection.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One group that certainly will not lose when the Government's legislation is passed are those people who actually work in the goldmining industry; that is, the workers who have always paid taxes on the wages they receive. The people who will lose is that succession of spivs who lounge around in Perth, who have done for as long as I can remember. I have seen them all; Tony Motion, Duncan Bell, Ian Cornelius, who incidentally did a bit of time in the slammer, along with Peter Briggs, for conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth-not as much time as he should have done; but he did go to the slammer for it. Of course, this is the group of people that the Liberal Party is pandering to in Western Australia in order to pick up, it hopes, votes and, more importantly, donations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it very clear that the spivs are wasting their money because the legislation will be passed; it will be proclaimed. Even if, in the highly unlikely event of a Liberal Government being returned federally and the Liberal Party being able to sort out its internal confusion, to which Senator Beahan referred at the beginning of his question, it will not have the numbers to repeal the legislation anyway. So the spivs are wasting their money.</PARA>
<PARA> In reference to the United States Treasury, a couple of days ago I explained that because of the double taxation agreement tax paid in Australia is deductible for United States equity holders against their United States tax liability. Because the tax is not paid in Australia, it is paid in Washington instead. As I have said before, although the United States has deteriorated very badly economically under the Reagan Administration, it is certainly not a Third World country and does not deserve to be the recipient of Australian foreign aid, which it currently is and which the Liberal Party would have it continue to be.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that yesterday morning in an interview on the wireless, Mr Tuckey, a Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives, claimed that because of the imputation system it really made no difference to the revenue collected by the Government whether gold companies were taxed or whether, through the imputation system, dividends were taxed when distributed to shareholders. That is not entirely true; it is partially true. Let us assume for a moment that that is entirely true and that it makes no difference to the revenue so far as Australian shareholders in goldmining ventures are concerned. If that is true, all that leaves is the $70m presently being donated to the United States Treasury-the taxes paid in Washington, in lieu of taxes which ought to be paid in Canberra. Therefore, on the basis of Mr Tuckey's analysis of the situation I invite anybody in the Liberal Party to justify having the United States as a recipient of Australian foreign aid. There are plenty of countries, if we were inclined to increase our foreign aid by $70m, more worthy than the United States to receive it. I also invite the Liberals who will be voting on this matter to table in the Senate the list of their shareholdings in goldmining companies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that the main reason for the proposed shift of naval facilities from Sydney to Jervis Bay was the desire of former Premier Neville Wran, Prime Minister Hawke and former sport and tourism Minister, John Brown, to obtain and develop the 260 hectares of land now occupied by the Newington Armaments Depot for a range of purposes, including the 1989 world student games? Second, has the main reason for the shift now become the possible use of the Newington site for the construction of an athletics stadium and village for the 1996 Olympics? Third, what is the latest date that the shift of the armament depot from Newington to Jervis Bay can take place, while still allowing timely access to the Newington site for the construction of facilities for the 1996 Olympic Games?

The idea that this Government or, indeed, any government, would consider undertaking something as major as the shift from Sydney to Jervis Bay on the basis that we wanted to support an Olympic Games bid is, I hope, impossible, but at best I can only describe this question as far-fetched. I do not normally ascribe to Senator Sanders a belief in all conspiracy theories, but this would be the ultimate conspiracy theory and would involve the sacrificing of all the principles of economic justice which this Government holds so dear. So the answer to question one is no. The answer to question two is no. The answer to question three is that as far as the Commonwealth is aware, the date of relocation of the armament depot will have no impact at all on the availability of land at Newington, in which the State is understood to have an interest for Olympic Games purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do agree with this view-because Senator Crowley might not have asked me the question otherwise-and my colleague, Mr Kerin, agrees with the view, too, as I read in the newspaper this morning. I want to say one or two things about the National Science and Technology Analysis Group Forum because it was a very important forum, and there was a very good interrelationship there between industry and the scientific community. Government support for research and development in Australia is stronger than in most other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, including, for example, Japan and the United States of America. However, during the decade of the seventies and even earlier than that, private sector research and development in Australia let this country down substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government now provides a comprehensive package of measures aimed at encouraging industry research and development, and part of this package is the generic technology scheme. This is designed to encourage collaboration between researchers in the public sector such as universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and companies in new or emerging technologies considered fundamental to future industry development. There have been four technologies designated as generic technologies as part of the scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know Senator Lewis has difficulty with these big words, but I will say it again: they are called generic technology schemes. There are more big words in the next part of the answer. The four schemes are biotechnology-the generic technologies-information technology, communications technology and new materials technology. Twenty million dollars is to be provided under this scheme in 1988-89 for projects most of which will extend over three years. Already the scheme has been running for just over two years and has been remarkably successful in fostering public and private sector collaboration. As a recent example, the Industry, Research and Development Board announced on Monday of this week grants worth $2.6m for projects in the field of new materials, each involving a high level of technological collaboration. Those collaborative arrangements were between the CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology and Wollongong University, and BHP Steel International, Bunge Industrial Steels and Eglo Engineering; between the University of Queensland and Ampol; between the University of Wollongong and C-Ramic Australia, SECO Tools and BHP Steel International; and between the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology organisation and the University of Adelaide with MM Metals Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generic grants usually require collaboration between the private sector and the public sector or else the grant will not be made. The Government has consistently argued that stronger links must be developed between public and private sector organisations in research and development as a means of changing both public sector and private sector cultures. There are a number of other incentives to stimulate private sector research and development, including the discretionary grant scheme, the 150 per cent tax concession, the national teaching company scheme, and the national procurement development program. Since the Government introduced the grants for industry research and development (GIRD) scheme in 1986-87, grants have increased from $11.2m to $33.4m for the current financial year.</PARA>

<PARA>Adjusting for inflation since that 12-month period, the current level of road funding in real terms is $120m higher than that advocated by Senator Stone on behalf of the National Party 15 months ago. The National Party does not seem to be able to make up its mind whether it wants to spend more money on roads or less. What it really wants is to do a bit of cheap political stunting and grandstanding, hoping it can pick up a few more votes in the bush than it has been getting in the past. Its vote has been steadily declining, as it deserves to do. This is a desperate attempt, through a bit of cheap political stunting, in the hope that it can get through all those country newspapers the fact that the National Party is in there fighting for people on the land and in the bush. Of course it is not. If it ever got into government-we have seen the punches that have been telegraphed by Senator Stone-there would be $120m less for road funding.

In answering this question I should bring to Senator Lewis's attention a bit of history in terms of this Government's record in the areas of children and compare it to the record of the previous Howard-Fraser Government. Let us remember that in 1976 under the Fraser-Howard regime, before it started hacking into the living standards of the poor, there were 372,000 children of pensioners and beneficiaries living in that classification. Payments for each child amounted to 15 per cent of the married rate pension. From the period 1975 to 1983-over the seven years of conservative rule-the number grew each year. It grew by 50,000 children a year for almost every year from 1976 to 1982. Then the Howard-Fraser regime destroyed the labour market in 1982-83 by a massive 150,000 children.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The compassionate Senator Stone was there all the time but he has no recognition of the plight of those people. Over the seven years of the Opposition regime there was an increase of 410,000 children. Their parents were forced into dependency by the direct policies of that Government. Not only should we look at numbers but we should look at the level of support for those children. Whilst the number of children was increasing under the Howard-Fraser regime the income support levels for children also decreased. In 1977 payments were at a level of 15.2 per cent of the married rate pension. By 1983 this had decreased to 11.1 per cent of the married rate pension. I would like to know what record Senator Lewis stands on when he comes in here criticising the Government's record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at this Government's record in comparison. We inherited the situation where in 1983 there were 266,900 children dependent on unemployment benefits. We have reduced this number. In January this year there were around 204,940 children dependent on such benefits. We have cut the number of children in unemployment beneficiary families by over 60,000. We have cut the number of children in pensioner and beneficiary families overall. The other important criterion in terms of payments is that we have made very significant improvements in the level of payments for children. We have increased it from 11.1 per cent at the start of 1983 to 14.1 per cent now for children under 13 and 17.2 per cent of the married rate pension for children between the ages of 13 and 15. Our commitment does not end there. The commitment that Senator Lewis referred to is one that is ongoing. Our commitment is to lift the levels to 15 per cent of the married rate pension for children under 13 and to 20 per cent for older children.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis mentioned the EPAC report. EPAC is not the only organisation that has made some judgments in this area. Helen Brownlee of the Institute of Family Studies was commenting on the Government's achievements in this area. She said that the Government's performance was a magnificent achievement. Let us not run away from that. Senator Lewis talked about other aspects of the EPAC report. Let us look at what this Government has done in this area in recent years. It is addressing the problem of poverty traps faced by low income working families, the problem that EPAC addresses. In the 1988-89 Budget we announced changes to the family allowance supplement (FAS) to operate from the start of January 1989.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis asked a long question so he is going to get a full answer. Once the FAS entitlement is determined under the new assessment procedures most families will continue to receive FAS for up to 12 months, regardless of any changes in income. This has been geared very much towards the poverty trap situation that EPAC addresses. There will no longer be an overlap between the withdrawal of FAS and the Medicare levy, another problem in terms of the poverty trap. We will also integrate child payments for pensioners and beneficiaries. As a consequence, because of initiatives involved in this integration and because of other measures to alleviate poverty traps, more than 400,000 pensioners and beneficiaries will be able to get employment by removing that disincentive caused by poverty traps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not have to look at the other areas such as rent assistance which the Government is increasing in this particular area. It does not just end there. Since coming to office this Government has introduced a number of measures to reduce poverty traps for pensioners, including the 1987 poverty trap measures, increasing the free area of child disregard, the introduction of pensioner earnings credit and the increase in the pensioner rebate. I could go into these at length if honourable senators wanted me to but I will not. I can mention rent assistance, mothers and guardians allowances, additional payments for children and so on. The bottom line is that this Government recognises the special problems of children. We also recognise the special problems faced by those in this area who want to go back into the work place and need assistance to do so. We introduced the Job, Education and Training program to help overcome work force barriers for those families and assist them to escape the poverty cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis mentioned a couple of points about the EPAC report which I should also dwell on. The EPAC report claimed that the numbers of people in poverty have increased in recent years. Let us compare the figures. The figures in the EPAC report are heavily influenced by the choice of years. For instance, the numbers in the EPAC tables compare figures from 1972-73-the height of a somewhat expansionary Whitlam era-with those from 1985-86 and also compare figures prior to the introduction of the family package. I think that that should be recognised. Similarly, the figures on the increase in tax rates compare 1985-86 rates with those of the 1950s and 1960s and, in fact, fail to take into account international trends in tax transfer arrangements. If Senator Lewis wants to get up here and talk about this Government's record and commitment in the area of child poverty, he should do two things: firstly, make an honest comparison and, secondly, look at his Government's record between 1976 and 1983.</PARA>

In other words, the attached material was of such a trashy and offensive nature that the guidelines prevented the Senate Printing Unit being asked to copy it. Further, are you aware that the said material was simply photostats of the covers of X-rated videos which this Government allows to be sold around Australia, through mail order from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), including stills from those videos which I asked Senator Reynolds about six months ago? Can you indicate whether the rationale behind the guidelines is consistent with the Government's recent decision to allow the sale and distribution of X-rated video material in the ACT to continue?

Will the three companies named as not complying be expected to introduce a plan by next year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2406" SPEAKER="Reynolds Sen The Hon M." NAMEID="XI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" MINISTERIAL="LOCAL GOVERNMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is delighted with the response of companies to the affirmative action legislation. We have had an outstanding compliance rate. All of the 67 higher education institutions have complied with the legislation and only three companies, as Senator Childs indicated, have not complied. What is important in relation to affirmative action and this first reporting procedure is the very outstanding cooperation of businesses throughout Australia. I do not really want to focus on negatives because, after all, a situation involving only three companies is scarcely worth talking about. The companies concerned have already been named in Parliament, and I will comment on them in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I want to focus on some of the very positive statements that have been made by national highly respected companies. I think what they say is an indication that the Government, despite the attitudes of the Opposition, was very much on the right track when it introduced this legislation amidst some uproar by some Opposition members and some controversy. I would like to quote statements that have been made by a number of these companies. First of all, Woolworths Ltd made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>Woolworth's is giving and will continue to give full support to its program under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1988. The legislation echoes Woolworth's long held policy of ensuring that job applications and staff are treated and promoted on their merit.</PARA>
<PARA>ICI Australia Ltd wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>ICI commenced equal employment opportunity programs in 1983 before it was a legislative requirement because we recognised it was good business management. If Australia is going to be competitive in the world markets, we can't afford to ignore half our human resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the three companies that have been named would do well to listen to those words of ICI. Digital Equipment Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Digital's Australian Affirmative Action Program has been developed in a Company environment fully committed to taking Affirmative Action to provide equal opportunity for all employees. Digital believes this program will assist us in achieving our business goals as well as complementing social and legislative change in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I wish to refer to another statement which I cannot neglect. The South Australian Gas Company Ltd said:</PARA>
<PARA>The greatest benefit of our program has been the realisation and general acceptance that women can, should, and are playing a diverse and important part in an industry which has previously been considered as predominantly a male domain.</PARA>
<PARA>It is well known that the three companies referred to by Senator Childs in his question have been named. Those companies are Inghams Enterprises Pty Ltd, which produces chickens; Mathers Enterprises Ltd, a footwear undertaking; and Suttons Motors Pty Ltd, a car sales company. Those companies will have the opportunity to implement a plan of action. Surely these companies will be encouraged to take positive steps by the fact that they are substantially in the minority. The three companies should be looking at what they are missing out on by not taking advantage of affirmative action. In fact, Inghams may find that more of their chickens will come home to roost if it were to take positive steps. I am sure that Mathers, whose stores are so popular with the women of Queensland and New South Wales, may find that it does not pay to be out of step with affirmative action. Finally, I am sure that if Suttons, the car investment company, were to introduce affirmative action it would find that it could drive its dollar further.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I suppose this is what one would call a very timely question. The Senate might remember that on 17 October Senator Zakharov asked me a similar question about this incident. At that time I mentioned that the Department of Community Services and Health had undertaken a number of tests in regard to Neroa condoms. I informed the Senate that in fact the condoms had failed the test conducted by the Department. I also outlined that my involvement in the area was as a result of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act which are designed to protect consumers from goods that either will or may cause injury. I also stated that the Government's preferred option in this area is to work the problem out with manufacturers and suppliers. I indicated that a degree of responsibility was being shown by the suppliers in this instance in agreeing to undertake voluntarily to withdraw the goods. I also mentioned-and I should repeat what I said-that tests were conducted by the Department of Community Services and Health as well as by an independent recognised testing authority and both those series of tests showed that the condoms in question failed certain standardised tests. It was very apparent that there was a breach of the Therapeutic Goods Order Australian Standard 1919. The Department of Community Services and Health has been negotiating with the supplier. I think I even thanked Senator Messner for his kind work in obtaining an acceptable agreement at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only problem is that since that time, and having placed advertisements in relevant newspapers, the company concerned has not fulfilled the conditions of the agreement with the Department of Community Services and Health. It has failed to contact in writing all known wholesalers, suppliers and retailers of the product and to inform them of the recall. In view of the fact that there has been failure to cooperate with the Department and in view of previous failures, I have raised this matter again with Mr Staples, and he in fact has recently written to me.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the product convincingly fails to comply with the Australian standard, I have no choice now but to institute a mandatory recall under the Trade Practices Act to ensure that consumers are protected from the potential health risk associated with the use of these products. I understand that the articles to which Senator Zakharov refers cast some reflection on the testing that has been done within Australia. I state and restate that the testing has been done by recognised authorities. I think in respect of the allegations made in the articles, the person who was testing them was testing them for a laboratory that was registered with the National Association of Testing Authorities and in fact was a person trained in accordance with the guidelines set down by that authority prior to any testing being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances involved, and in response to Senator Zakharov, there is no question of doubt that the test results performed within Australia are appropriate and satisfactory. In terms of tests taken overseas, the Department here and neither the Minister nor myself have been given adequate results and details of such tests. I think in the light of the fact that the tests conducted within Australia have been done according to our standards, then they are the tests that we have to go by. As a consequence, as I indicated, I have no alternative but to institute a mandatory recall.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one other part of the question that Senator Zakharov raised to which I should refer and that is very quickly to rebut any allegations of anti-Japanese discrimination. I find them unacceptable and ridiculous, and I see them as being a very poor attempt to discredit. The allegation has been made that we are introducing this recall because we have not forgotten the war. That is a statement made out of South Australia. I reject that totally and indicate that the Government's decision has been made very much on proper standards and procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during Question Time Senator Newman asked a question relating to Army rations. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following information: Last year the Army spent $22.2m on rations. This financial year, $26.7m has been allocated. Given a slightly higher carry over of claims from 1987-88, the special provision of $1.4m in 1988-89 is to produce combat ration packs for 1989 and the effect of price increases. The level of funding in Army rations in 1988-89 compared to 1987-88 is very similar. Once funds are allocated to commands, military districts and units, the responsibility for selection and purchase of fresh rations, such as those mentioned by the honourable senator, rests with the local commanders in accordance with the Australian Defence Force rations scale. This gives him or her the discretion to vary the items purchased based on local cost and availability, including seasonal commodities. Currently expenditure is running higher than planned and as a consequence a direction has been issued principally as a reminder to local commanders of the need for economy whilst maintaining the nutritional content based on the rations scale. The rations available remain of a high standard in terms of both quality and quantity. Accordingly, there will be no reduction in rations and quarters charges.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. Yesterday, Senator Robert Ray, the former Minister for Home Affairs, answered a question from Senator McMullan concerning the Castlereagh by-election in 1980 and the tape I tabled of one Mr John Patrick Begg, who boasted that he had arranged for 400 dead men to vote for the Labor Party in that by-election. Senator Ray said yesterday that one Mrs Curran had been viciously smeared. At no time was an imputation cast by me or any individual except upon Mr Begg, who boasted of his success for Premier Wran in 1980.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise with you a matter which is within your jurisdiction under the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 which deals with questions of privilege and a number of other related questions and, in paragraph 9, the exercise of freedom of speech. That resolution of the Senate, Mr President, if I may just remind you since I do not think it is before you, states that senators speaking in the Senate or in a committee should take certain matters into account. Those matters are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) the need to exercise their valuable right of freedom of speech in a responsible manner;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the damage that may be done by allegations made in Parliament to those who are the subject of such allegations and to the standing of Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the limited opportunities for persons other than members of Parliament to respond to allegations made in Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the need for Senators, while fearlessly performing their duties, to have regard to the rights of others; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the desirability of ensuring that statements reflecting adversely on persons are soundly based. </PARA>
<PARA>The resolution goes on to say that you, Mr President, whenever you think it desirable to do so, may `draw the attention of the Senate to the spirit in the letter of this resolution'. I just wish to raise this matter with you and ask you to consider whether that should be done at the moment, as I believe it should be. I remind you that over the last few days we have had a number of statements in response to questions from Senator Walsh in which he has made very severe attacks on people who are not directly protected by the Standing Orders because they are not members of this place, members of the High Court of Australia, or members of a State parliament. Those attacks have been in the context of the quality and calibre of people who are opposed to the Government's gold tax proposals. I raise that in the context of the fact that on 16 December 1986-not all that long ago-the Treasurer, Mr Keating, and Senator Evans in a joint statement said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has concluded that the importance of encouraging active exploration and development, and of maximising . . . the consequent export income generated by the gold mining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 July 1987, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that he would not introduce a gold tax during the next three-year term of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise that because, whilst within relatively recent times the most senior spokesmen for the Government have made these statements about a gold tax, a Minister of the Crown has made exaggerated and intemperate attacks on private citizens who are not directly protected by the Standing Orders. Today was a particularly obnoxious example of that. Individuals were named and certain things were said about them. I think that in at least one case the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is in serious error. He referred by name to a Mr Ian Cornelius. I do not know whether he is aware that there at least two people of that name in Western Australia. It is my understanding that one of them went to gaol, but the one who is related to the mining industry is not that person. I mention this because I think there is a clear breach of the spirit of the resolution which was carried in this Senate on the initiative of a Minister of the Government. Mr President, I ask you to consider the replies that have been given by Senator Walsh over the last few days relating to gold tax and to consider whether in all the circumstances you should draw the attention of Senator Walsh, in particular, and the Senate in general to the spirit and letter of the resolution which was passed. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view there is obviously a need for robust debate in this place, and I do not seek to avoid that. However, the attack on the character of people and the imputations against people who are advocating a policy stance which was in fact the policy of this Government until very recently are quite ludicrous. It does little for the reputation of this place to see that continue. I ask you to give it your attention. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology:</PARA>
<PARA> Current Australian experience with new management techniques in manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a statement explaining the background to the reference which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee intends to evaluate the current experience in Australia with such techniques as Value Added Management, Total Quality Control, Just in Time, Materials Resource Planning and Critical Path Planning. They are all different varieties of, what for Australia, are new management processes. </PARA>
<PARA> For our overseas competitors, particularly Northern Europe and Japan, they have been mainstream management techniques for decades. In Australia, particularly since the early 1980s, there have been various attempts to spread these techniques through the manufacturing sector in the hope of ``catching up'' with the competition. </PARA>
<PARA> A full evaluation of the experience with modern management systems has not been undertaken to date. The points to be considered are:</PARA>
<PARA> the implementation of these management techniques which appears to have failed to recognise the peculiarities of the Australian industrial climate. There seems to be little adaptation for local or plant level environments;</PARA>
<PARA> the sufficiency of the effort put into ensuring that the philosophy and practice of these techniques penetrates the whole management system, and not simply the top level and planning departments. In particular, is sufficient education put into middle management and line supervisors to explain the changes to their roles and responsibilities? As often as not many programs have been put in jeopardy by supervisors who see them as threats to their jobs;</PARA>
<PARA> the apparent little genuine recognition that the success of these techniques depends on the commitment of the employees and their organisation, and employees' early involvement in the planning and implementation including their degree of control over work processes; and</PARA>
<PARA> the existence of infrastructure, both internally in enterprise training and externally in TAFE, Australian Institute of Management etc., to support the changed roles implied in these techniques. Is sufficient emphasis placed in trade training and non-trade training on changing techniques? In particular, is there increased emphasis on responsibility for quality?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the text of the tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The report results from the Committee's examination of the potential of the Kakadu National Park region with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> the nature of the resources available for exploitation and</PARA>
<PARA> the impact of the utilisation of these resources, particularly mining and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was referred to the Standing Committee on National Resources in October 1985. The National Resources Committee received submissions from 69 individuals and organisations and held eleven days of public hearings. It also carried out a number of inspections of the Park region. Other areas were visited to examine, in particular, mining rehabilitation work. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1987, following the reorganisation of the Senate Committees, the inquiry was referred to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. This Committee (which includes two members of the former National Resources Committee) undertook further briefings in Darwin and carried out an inspection of the Kakadu National Park region. We also received two additional submissions and numerous supplementary submissions. In addition we sought further and updated information on many matters. I would like to acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who gave unstinting assistance to both Committees and without whose help the report could not have been produced. </PARA>
<PARA> We have defined the Kakadu National Park region as the area within the outermost boundaries of the Park. Defined in this way the region includes areas such as the Ranger Project area, the Jabiluka project area, the Koongarra Project Area and the Conservation Zone, which are excluded from the Park proper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kakadu National Park region is of immense importance, and not just to Australia. Stages 1 and 2 of the Park, together forming an area of 13 073 square kilometres, are already inscribed on the list of World Heritage Properties and the listing of Stage 3 has been foreshadowed. This listing identifies their environmental importance not just to Australia, but to the world. It recognises the abundant and diverse physical, biological and cultural resources of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the region has mineral deposits of world significance. These include not only the uranium deposits which are on a par with the world's largest, but also substantial deposits of gold, platinum and palladium. According to one estimate, for example, the total value of the gold, platinum and palladium deposits in the Conservation Zone exceeds $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The region is also significant because of its Aboriginal associations and because it supports viable, contemporary Aboriginal communities. Almost all of the 6144 square kilometres of Stage 1 of the Park is Aboriginal land, which has been leased back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Nearly seven per cent of Stage 2 of the Park is also owned by Aborigines and the Stage 3 region, including the Conservation Zone is the subject of a land claim by Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from land ownership however, are the cultural and religious links of Aborigines to the land. The Kakadu region contains the largest and in general the best preserved body of rock art in the world. No one seeing it can fail to be impressed or moved by what is an important part, not just of Aboriginal culture, but of Australian culture. </PARA>
<PARA> The very richness and diversity of the Kakadu region means that its potential can be viewed from many different perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as a unique environment that should be protected from the further depredations of man at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as a reservoir of living resources, both native and introduced, that can be exploited commercially. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as an area of immense mineral wealth that should be used for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as providing a wilderness experience for those wishing to experience nature in their own solitude. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as an area providing stunning scenery and wildlife that should be made available to the many by providing the necessary infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen as an area unparalleled for the opportunities it offers to research into the ecosystems of the wet dry tropics. </PARA>
<PARA> And, because the Park itself encompasses 19804 square kilometres, it can also be seen as an area able to meet all these needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Overlying all of these other uses is the need to be responsive to the Aboriginal owners and to assist them in maintaining their choices about the way they wish to live in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has gathered evidence on the various resources of the region, how they are being used, how they might be used and what impacts result from their utilisation. In all the report makes 39 recommendations which address matters relating to the use and the management of the Park region. They are intended to ensure that the potential benefits of the region are realised in such a way that the natural beauty and environmental integrity of the Park remain undamaged. They are also directed towards ensuring that the rights of the Aborigines living in the area can be exercised freely and are not jeopardised by any of the commercial or other activities taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is the most important and pervasive use of the Park itself. It is the Northern Territory's second most important industry after mining and Kakadu National Park is one of the most critical components of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Visitors from Australia and around the world are attracted by the stunning scenery; the variety of plants and animals, including the crocodiles and especially the birds; and the magnificent rock art and other archaeological sites. In 1987 there were 185 000 visitors to the Park with, on average, each visitor staying more than three days. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted the very rapid increase in the number of tourists visiting the region and examined their impact on the Aborigines resident in the Park and on the Park environment. The report contains a number of recommendations designed to remove or minimise the damaging impacts that have occurred, or might occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of these recommendations are intended to ensure that people visiting the region are given accurate information about the area so that they can properly appreciate why certain restrictions apply and understand the vulnerability of art work and other features of the Park. Combined with necessary display and other facilities these should add to the enjoyment of visitors while preserving the important sites from unnecessary damage. </PARA>
<PARA> The rapid increase in tourist numbers over recent years is beginning to put a strain upon some of the facilities in the Park, although the opening of a new motel at Jabiru will have a beneficial effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that a series of charges be introduced for entry into the Park and for the use of facilities such as camping grounds. The fees levied should be related to the provision, improvement and maintenance of services and facilities in the Park. By introducing the fees in association with an advance booking system it should be possible to ensure that the most popular areas and facilities can be made available to the maximum number of visitors in a fair and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA> It is likely that the number of visitors will continue to grow and the report recommends that a long-range tourist strategy be developed for the Park. This should examine the growth in tourist numbers at particular destinations, the maximum visitor carrying capacity of different areas and the optimum pattern of tourist infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Exploration for minerals or mining is expressly prohibited on any lands within Kakadu National Park by 1987 amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. However, a number of mineral rich areas with the region are not contained within the Park. These include the Ranger, Koongarra, and Jabiluka mining project areas, and the Conservation Zone in the Gimbat and Goodparla area. </PARA>
<PARA> Mining activity in the region has had an economic impact not just on the local economy but on Australia as a whole. The Ranger Uranium Mine itself employs around 500 people and total indirect employment is put at 485, not including those in government departments and agencies providing services in Jabiru or monitoring the impact of uranium mining in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examined the environmental impact of Ranger and has made a number of recommendations relating to the need for continued monitoring, particularly in relation to water management. The report also discusses the impact of the Ranger mine and the royalties received from the mine, on the local Aboriginal population. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits are not at present being mined. The Jabiluka uranium/gold deposit has a gross value in excess of $A20 billion while the non-discounted ten year total export revenue from the Koongarra deposit is estimated at $1.76 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does not make any recommendations as to whether permission should be given for Jabiluka and Koongarra mines to go into production. The view of the majority of the Committee was that a wide range of matters would need to be considered in making such recommendations, including the state of the world market for uranium, a matter outside the terms of reference for our inquiry. However, in saying this I note that both the Jabiluka and Koongarra project environmental impact statements have been approved by the Government and that the companies responsible for both of these projects have reached the necessary agreements with the relevant Aboriginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill gold, platinum and palladium deposit is valued at over $500 million. It is located in the Conservation Zone, which is considered highly prospective. One estimate is that there are more than $1.5 billion of in situ mineral resources to be discovered in the Zone. An environmental impact statement for the Coronation Hill project has not yet been finalised. The report makes recommendations on the particular matters to be covered by the environmental impact statement which, in its view, will need special scrutiny given the mines location near the South Alligator river. It also recommends arrangements to ensure that the site will be effectively rehabilitated should mining take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Exploration and mining activity in other parts of the Conservation Zone would need to be carried out in an equally sensitive way if environmental damage is to be avoided. A further factor requiring extreme sensitivity in this region is that a land claim has been lodged by the Jawoyn people over the whole of the area covered by the Conservation Zone. This claim has not yet been heard. The report makes recommendations designed to ensure that any delays in settling the land claim will not result in the Aboriginal interests in the area, including those relating to their sacred sites, being ignored, and that the views of the Jawoyn people on exploration and mining in the area are taken fully into account. </PARA>
<PARA> One side effect of mining in the region has been the establishment of a town within the Park, at Jabiru. The town was planned for 3 500 people but its present population is only 1 200. In some ways that town has been the biggest impact of mining of the region. Although originally a purely mining town, with the recent opening of the crocodile shaped motel developed by the Gagudju association with the royalties obtained from uranium mining, it will begin to play an increasing role in tourism. We have recommended that the Office of the Supervising Scientist be given a clearly defined responsibility to monitor the environmental impact of Jabiru and that proposed developments within the town be subject to environmental evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fish and buffalo are two of the major living resources being exploited in the region. We have not opposed the continuation of recreational fishing, recognising the important role that it plays in tourism in the Park. However, the majority of the Committee believes that the commercial exploitation of native living resources is incompatible with the high standards of resource preservation required by World Heritage listing, and the report recommends the phasing out of both commercial fishing and crabbing, as well as the maintenance of the existing ban on hunting. Buffalo are in a different category from fish in that they are introduced and have been responsible for considerable damage to the environment. Moreover, they can serve as a resource for exotic bovine diseases. However, buffalo also appeal to tourists and have become a favoured source of fresh meat for the Aboriginal population. For this reason the report recommends that the feasibility be examined of establishing a disease free herd or a buffalo park in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues addressed in this report all relate in one way or another to the management of the Park. Because of the deficiencies we have identified in Park management, and particularly to ensure greater consultation with all interested parties, the report recommends that a Board of Management be created to manage the Park. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also examined in some detail the role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in the Park and in the region, and its relationships with the various bodies with which it has to deal. The majority report recommends that the Government urgently consider locating all operations of the OSS in the Northern Territory, and that the need to strengthen and increase the responsibilities of the Office be examined. In order to ensure that the Office of the Supervising Scientist maintains its present level of cost recovery, the report also recommends that a levy be placed on exploration and mining activity in the Conservation Zone in line with the responsibilities of the Office in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has attached to it a minority report, probably one of the more substantial minority reports that have been brought down in the Senate. It is over 100 pages long and indicates the clear division in views of members of the Committee. The minority report is signed by me, Senator Panizza and Senator McGauran because we found ourselves separated in some fundamental areas. Perhaps I could just go through some of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that there was a great deal of debate, for instance, on the simple matter of the aesthetic beauty of the Kakadu National Park itself and the various parts of it. But of course these differences are quite natural because judgments of this type are subjective and depend on individual tastes and perceptions. It is our view that the description provided in the majority report, without being unkind to the authors, more resembled a travelogue one would expect to find in a glossy brochure rather than a dispassionate and objective description of a park. Accordingly we dissented and provided our own description of the park. The evidence that we received varied as to the aesthetic value of the park and various parts of it. For instance, a Professor Messel gave evidence on a number of matters and described the park in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> Do not get carried away with all the nonsense you read down here-</PARA>
<PARA>as I recall it, his evidence was given in Canberra-</PARA>
<PARA>about the wonderful place it is up there. Ask us, we will tell you. </PARA>
<PARA>The Professor had spent some considerable time doing research in the park. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> At most of the places there is nothing to see except bloody mud banks, mangroves and a few buffaloes staggering around. When you get into the upstream sections, up in the hills and rocky places, the scenery is very spectacular but for the 100-odd kilometres downstream to the mouth there is very little to see. The crocodiles are the most interesting things. The bird life is very scarce. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> I would say that if you did not have crocodiles below Cahills Crossing and the barramundi were as depleted as they are, I have no idea why people would ever go there. If you went you would go once to see the mangroves and return and never go again and tell all your friends not to bother. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Once you have been there for an hour you have seen it all . . . The upstream sections of Kakadu National Park are very nice but, as I said, once you get beyond Cahills Crossing there is nothing to see . . . If you have a lot of dangerous crocodiles swimming around in the water and tour boats going over there-</PARA>
<PARA>that is of some interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not necessarily subscribe to that description of the park, but it certainly fits comfortably, in my view, with very large parts of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, in referring to another group which gave evidence and which has been quite vocal on the issue of the intrinsic beauty of the park, that it is not without significance that by and large those who are opposed ideologically to uranium mining within Kakadu, or uranium mining per se, are interestingly enough able to find beauty in all areas of the park. To these people even the most scorched, barren, windblown areas of sandy spinifex have a natural and unique, breathtaking beauty. I believe that there are parts of the park which are very beautiful and very spectacular to all of us. I refer to the Jim Jim Falls, Obiri Rock, Twin Falls, UDP Falls and the escarpment at Cooinda, and the area at Yellow Waters is in parts very beautiful, as is the flood plain region. But it is not unreasonable to say that there are thousands and thousands of hectares of boring, monotonous country very similar to millions of hectares of country that one will find in any part of the north of Australia. The most charitable view of a contrary opinion is that it defies logic. If it were not for the discrete areas of natural beauty in the park, I suspect that it would be like some other parts of Australia-somewhere one goes when one is on the way somewhere else. Professor Messel, for his money, found the area decidedly uninteresting. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps Kakadu came very much to the fore of tourist interests and news as a result of the movie Crocodile Dundee, but the contribution made by that movie to Kakadu was to distort the picture of the scenery of the region. The areas in the park shown in Crocodile Dundee were many miles apart and, as I recall the film showed UDP Falls, Twin Falls and parts of Yellow Waters. But, looking at the movie, one would not realise that poor old Mick was walking hundreds of miles a day with the delicious Miss Kozlowski to get from one point to another. That highlights the fact that vast areas of the park are uninteresting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a charitable soul, Senator Button, and you have touched the more generous part of my soul. My objection to much of the material offered by the anti-uranium lobby is that it was presented when it was known to be factually untrue. Much of it was presented in a highly emotional way. The movement against uranium mining was as bad as anybody else. Its evidence can be found in part in the majority report. I can only assume that it was left to the majority report to show the quality of some of the evidence that was given to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No technical evidence was offered which demonstrated that uranium mining at Ranger had had any deleterious effects on the ecology or had in any way damaged the environment beyond the fact that the mine was physically there. Absolutely no evidence was given that showed any detrimental effect on the ecosystem. The Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) made it quite clear that in its view mining could continue in the park without in any way being detrimental to the park. It should be remembered that the Ranger mine has now been subject to around 1,000 inquiries and reports, including 150 into the tailings dam. The Office of the Supervising Scientist, which is responsible for environmental standards at Ranger, has a staff of over 80 and has spent so far some $42.5m in monitoring the effect of mining in the park. The Supervising Scientist, in all his annual reports, has found nothing of consequence or significance to indicate that Ranger's presence in the park is having any environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad fact is that the poor quality of some of the evidence proved that those who have an ideological or philosophical objection to mining, milling or use of mining promptly jettisoned any facade of intellectual rigour and cast their arguments into the cloudy mire of the unknown. When it was able to be demonstrated that mining has had no deleterious effect on the park-and the evidence that led to that conclusion was compelling-we found that the anti-uranium people fell back on the premise that there was much still to be learnt about the effects of mining in the park and that a great deal is still not known. That ignores the fact that the Ranger uranium mine has been there for eight years and that there have been 1,000 reports and inquiries into its effects and 150 reports relating to the tailings dam, and that the OSS has spent some $46m on monitoring. It should be clearly understood that the anti-uranium mining lobby is not one constituency. It is a coalition of different groups with different agendas. The one significant part of that coalition is the group who are opposed to nuclear weapons. Their essential objection is not to mining within the park; it is to the use of uranium in weapons manufacture. Part of their agenda is to deny access for this purpose. It is not remarkable or surprising to find that I have not yet discovered one person who is opposed to the manufacture of nuclear weapons who can find that uranium mining can take place in the park. Exactly the same people find environmental problems as those who would wish there not to be the manufacture of nuclear weapons. When one is taking evidence it is not to the credit of witnesses who, rather than put their agenda on the table, find dishonest ways of seeking to deny access to the park. I, in common with my colleagues, would defend with my last breath those who take up and fight for any cause, whatever its merit, provided they do so honestly and with conviction and not with dishonesty and connivance. </PARA>
<PARA> As I interpret the evidence, the interesting thing is that perhaps uranium mining has far less potential to damage the environment of Kakadu, if it is properly managed, than does the mining of many other minerals and metals. One might find that due to mismanagement the elements resulting from the mining of copper, lead or zinc, could be decidedly more detrimental to the environment than elements resulting from the mining of uranium. However, uranium is elevated and then shrouded in mystery, fear and danger. Of course, as our minority report states radon gas and radium are perfectly capable of management and control. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters deserve some attention. Perhaps I could turn for a moment to the water that is retained within the Ranger mine area. Much was made of the danger that that water poses to the park. Certainly no evidence was given to the Committee to suggest that that water is likely to be a danger in any way. I remind the Senate that, for instance, on occasions water is released from retention pond 4. It is proposed also to release water, if necessary, from retention pond 2. As I think we point out in our minority report, water from retention pond 4 simply is water which is run off over waste dump rocks. By definition, that is material that has not been milled as overburden and contains less than 0.23 per cent uranium. To put it in some sort of perspective, the water found in retention ponds 2 and 4 is very nearly of drinking water standards. In fact, it is quite safe to drink. The water from retention pond 2 is simply rain water trapped after running off the area of the mine plant and, as I said, undiluted it meets the Australian drinking water standards, with the exception of one or two elements. However, we had evidence to suggest that that water would have a vile effect on the ecology of the area. That has not been found to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the more significant recommendations that was made by the minority report was that which said that mining ought to commence at Jabiluka and Koongarra. On the evidence, we could find no reason why those mining operations should not begin immediately. Both the companies concerned have fulfilled their responsibilities in respect of the environmental impact statements. In the case of Koongarra an environmental impact statement for the project was prepared in 1979. In 1981 the Minister advised that there was no environmental objection to approval being given for the project. The minority report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The company was able, in the words of the majority report, to confirm that:</PARA>
<PARA>following the preparation of the environmental impact statement for the project, it had been informed in September 1981 that the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development had advised that there was no environmental objection to approval being given to the project. Environmental requirements for the project have been endorsed by the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory, the Northern Land Council and the Company. Draft applications filed in 1982 and 1983 under the Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act 1978 to mine and construct a uranium mill facility were approved, among others, by the Commonwealth Departments of Environment, ANPWS, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the Office of the Supervising Scientist, the Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory Conservation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I might just add that the royalties flowing to the Aboriginal community from the operation of that mine will amount to $256m during the life of the mine. The status of the Jabiluka project is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>All conditions and requirements of the Federal and Northern Territory Governments have been met. An agreement has been entered into with the Northern Land Council and approved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. A mineral lease was issued by the Northern Territory Government on 12 August 1982 on the advice of the then Minister for Resources and Energy administering section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the other recommendations of material consequence flowing from the minority report was our view that it was suitable to apply a multiple land use to Kakadu National Park. It was a view supported by the Western Australian State Government in its submission No. 43. Also it was supported by the Northern Territory Government. We were ably assisted in our deliberations by the support of the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . subject to appropriate protection there ought to be no intrinsic rational reason why a multiple land use regime should not be established for national parks, which already accommodate a variety of different land uses anyway, such as tourism and so on, and in some cases agriculture. Therefore, there ought to be in principle no objection to a wider ranging multiple land use regime. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to describe much of the area as `clapped out buffalo country'. I make no judgment about that except to say that there are parts of the park to which that description is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter I wish to raise at the moment concerning the interaction between the Coronation Hill joint venture partners, the Jawoyn community, the Sacred Sites Authority and the Northern Land Council. I make it clear that I speak for myself when I say that on the basis of the evidence provided to the Committee in my judgment there is reason for grave concern as to the status of the relationship between the Jawoyn Aboriginal community and the personalities within the Northern Territory Sacred Sites Authority. I am far from satisfied that the Sacred Sites Authority reflects in its conduct or attitude the views of the traditional owners or the majority of the Jawoyn people. Regrettably, I have been drawn to the conclusion that in particular Mr Cooper of the Sacred Sites Authority has his own agenda for the mining of uranium in particular and mining in general. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the Jawoyn people are not opposed to mining at Coronation Hill and most of them do not consider the Coronation Hill site as significant, as was made clear in the evidence given to the Committee. However, the Sacred Sites Authority, or at least Mr Cooper from the Authority, and characters or personalities within the Northern Land Council clearly are opposed to that mining. I suppose that it is not without significance that at the 1 July meeting called to approve mining-this is referred to in our report-notwithstanding three-quarters of an hour of haranguing of the Jawoyn people by Mr Cooper, approval for mining was given. However, a subsequent meeting was held on 4 July which was attended by what one might describe as the heavies of the Northern Land Council, people such as Robert Lee, Raymond Fordimail, Mick Dodson and one or two others. We then found that the decision was reversed. I put it to the Senate that the second meeting was dominated by the Northern Land Council and the Jawoyn people were bullied and harassed into agreeing to the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be understood that from the very first day the Northern Land Council and the Sacred Sites Authority were involved in shaping events. It is not without significance to note, as does our minority report on page 304, that on 17 September 1985 the Northern Land Council contacted the Coronation Hill Joint Venture partners to ask them what was going on at Coronation Hill. On the same day, after they were accordingly advised, a request was made to list the area as a sacred site. On that same day, if my memory serves me correctly, Mr Cooper of the Sacred Sites Authority was found on Coronation Hill's licence area. When he was asked to leave, it was with some reluctance he gave his name and his responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ellis, in evidence, said that Mr Cooper must have been lost; that he was in the Eva Valley area updating the information that the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority had. However, my further information is that in fact Mr Cooper went directly from Katherine to Coronation Hill and so returned upon being asked to leave the site. </PARA>
<PARA> I have drawn the conclusion that since day one the Sacred Sites Authority and the Northern Land Council have-in my view, with growing enthusiasm-opposed mining at Coronation Hill; but I do acknowledge that the Sacred Sites Authority chose not to reverse the permit to explore in the region following the 4 July meeting. However, as our minority report says, and as is shown by the evidence given by the Jawoyn people at Barunga, the Jawoyn people are not opposed to mining at Coronation Hill, and on the evidence they never have been. </PARA>

The Aboriginal community returned from Groote Eylandt and declared its support for mining, as is shown in the evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were told also by Mr Cooper and two members of the Jawoyn community-as I remember it was Raymond Fordimail and Peter Jatbula-that the Jawoyn people working on Coronation Hill would withdraw their labour in the event that they were so asked by those two elders. At a subsequent meeting held by the Jawoyn people they resolved that they would continue to work on the site. There are about 50 or 60 further Jawoyn people who have their names down for employment, and a number of them live at Coronation Hill. There is nothing in the evidence I can find other than that of Peter Jatbula and Raymond Fordimail, as I recall, that leads us to believe that mining is opposed on Coronation Hill. I suggest that those who have not already done so might care to glance at that evidence which was taken at Burunga. </PARA>

Sandy Barroway said exactly the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sad thing for the Aboriginal community is that I have no doubt that the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority and the Northern Land Council will round up one or two Jawoyn people with their normal tactics of intimidation and convince them to say publicly that they are opposed to mining, when previously people like Nipper Brown, Sandy Barraway and the more senior-in some cases, the most senior-members of the Jawoyn community have said they give their unqualified support to mining by BHP at Coronation Hill. They have also expressed their satisfaction with their negotiations with BHP and with the conduct of BHP. I have no doubt that now we will find the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority trotting out people who will be giving different evidence, and that is a tragedy for the Aboriginal community. When these people with their hidden agendas move on, who will be left to pick up the pieces? It will be the Aboriginal community. These people will go on to some new cause, some newfound ambition, and the Aboriginal community will be left with the pain and suffering that will be inflicted on them by these people who have used them in a way which is disgraceful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have your minority report in front of me, Senator. I would like to address a few remarks initially to the matter of the Kakadu National Park itself. I remind honourable senators that in attempting to protect large areas for national parks-and I emphasise the words `large areas' because that is a point that Senator Crichton-Browne has referred to in a certain pejorative way-the necessity to preserve large areas relates to the necessity to preserve a sufficiently diverse genetic base to ensure that those areas can continue, even given very significant environmental changes. Anybody who considers the future and the past of the Kakadu area will know that the extensive wetland areas which are a very important component of Kakadu have, in the relatively recent past, speaking geologically, been under the sea and, in the relatively near future, given the greenhouse effect, are likely to be under the sea again. We already have the experience of highly competent scenic photographers going to Kakadu and saying that they want to photograph some of those areas while they are still available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that the shape of Kakadu over the next several centuries will probably be very significantly different from the shape of Kakadu as we see it today. It becomes extremely important to protect those large areas so that the genetic diversities which now exist on the flood plains can continue to exist as those areas recede inland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kakadu area is one that I have taken a particular interest in over a long time. I have been a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation Council since 1973, which predates the establishment of the Kakadu National Park, and I visited that area long before there was a park there. I am particularly concerned that after so many years we still hear from people like Senator Crichton-Browne that the area has values in such a limited range of exposures and human experiences. </PARA>

I do not know whether Senator Crichton-Browne has been out in what he describes as the very uninteresting and arid back country of South Australia, out on gibber plains where one has to almost get down with a magnifying glass to find the small species of plants and turn over rocks to find lizards. It is hard to find much life at all in that country. Frankly, I find the experience of being alone in such a vast desert a very moving and valuable experience. To sit out there at night-time under stars which are so bright that one feels one can almost reach up and pluck them out of the heavens, and to be in a stillness without intrusion from vast numbers of tourists, is an extremely valuable and very moving experience. Senator Crichton-Browne would deny that experience to many people because he wants to pack as much mining, tourism, fishing and other activities into those areas as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me pick up Senator Panizza's point. Page 250 of the minority report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Australian's environment ought to be available for all Australians, not just healthy hikers. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen the likes of Senator Panizza wanting to put cable cars up to the top of Ayers Rock, to put roads into areas that are pristine, natural areas and to make them available to the most infirm people in wheelchairs in the country. What the honourable senator has said is that he will destroy the environment to make it available to all Australians. I make the point that that process destroys most of the very values that he is trying to make available. There are areas which are intrinsically worth preserving for their own sake and which in that process of preservation will be available only to those who are prepared to put a pack on their back and walk in there. Even then this extremely valuable experience will only be available to relatively small numbers of people at a time. To simply say that it is selfish to deny those experiences to all Australians and to so mess up the environment in an attempt to make them available is simply to deny those experiences to any Australian. That is the end result of the attitude which I find repeatedly coming from the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> We find in the report the statement that the low land is very monotonous. The implication of that statement is quite clear; that is, that there are many other representations of that type of country elsewhere. Within Kakadu that low land area has been protected from the intrusion of foreign species, something which the Kakadu Park authorities have found quite difficult. In other areas those same representations of that so-called monotonous land are not protected from the intrusions of mining, roads and all sorts of other developments. As a representation of that so-called monotonous country, from the biological point of view, it is important to have substantial representation of that country within national parks. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 248 of the report says that there should be a commitment to `opening up' more archeological and art sites. Again, it is extremely moving to stand alone in front of Aboriginal art works which have been there for thousands of years to get some sense of the environment in which those art works were put down when populations were small and when the areas were isolated. There was a sense of the human being only one element in the environment, and by no means the dominant element. That sense and experience is simply not possible when there are thousands of tourists trooping past, pushing and shoving and simply looking at the art works. The sense that comes through in the minority report is that tourism is all about the sense of sight, about looking at things. We get no idea that it understands that being a visitor into a natural area also involves the sense of oneness with nature, of being alone with nature, the ability to be private, to be quiet, to listen, and to smell. Those are also very important human senses which not too many centuries ago were within the range of everybody's experience. But the way the Opposition is going-and I must say a great number of people on the dominant side of the Government would seek to open everything up to exploitation-those experiences are going to be denied to all future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill site is mentioned in the report. The Coronation Hill proposed developers have spoken about these minerals-particularly, gold, platinum and palladium-being strategic minerals. Presumably they are the sorts of minerals that in times of world shortage, in times of imposition on trade restrictions or in times of warfare would be absolutely vital to Australia's survival. That is what I understand is meant by strategic minerals. Yet what does the Opposition want to do? It wants to open the mine now and flog the minerals off in a few years or decades. They are not going to be there as strategic resources. One of the things one notices about resources is that if they are not exploited now they are still resources which remain there for future generations. In much of the Opposition's rhetoric it talks about the resource richness of Australia. Yet it still wants to get into those small parts-and I stress small parts-of this country which are set aside as national parks. If we are so resource rich let us look at exploiting-and I use that word quite deliberately-those resources which are not in national parks. The resources in national parks are not going to go away. If the next generation or the generation after that desperately needs to get at the platinum, palladium and gold in Coronation Hill those resources will still be there. </PARA>
<PARA> A moment ago I used the term `resource exploitation'. Unfortunately, in several places Senator Crichton-Browne talked about resource development. There is no such thing as a resource development. Resources are not developed; they are exploited. I wish to quote yet again Amery Loven's expression which I think very aptly describes the process. He said, `Whoever talks about developing a bank account by taking money out of it?'. That is precisely what we are doing with resource exploitation. There is no advantage to Australia in exploiting resources by the liquefaction of those resources, that is turning resources into money, if that money is not used for durable purposes. If it is frittered away it is not a resource at all. I am really surprised at the Opposition, which has been highly critical of Aboriginal people in recent days for frittering away taxpayers' money. The example is before them of the way in which resources can be misapplied and cease to be resources. Yet it talks about developing resources in the ground-in other words, turning them into money-without expressing any concern for what that money is used to provide. If it is used to provide services such as education and to raise the cultural levels of society-those elements which are sustainable in the long term-it is indeed providing resources which are valuable. Many of the things on which money is spent are simply not of any long term value, so the resources simply cease to be resources in any sense whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, unfortunately and very disappointingly, has drawn on evidence which was given in camera to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I find that distressing and distasteful because the evidence was not given to the Committee to be used in that way. It was given in camera; it was private information for that Committee. Moreover, if that practice becomes at all widespread, it will seriously inhibit the ability of parliamentary committees to have witnesses appear before them. Witnesses simply will not be prepared to come forward if they know that their evidence, which is given honestly in camera-in secret, to be heard only by that committee-is exposed to the public gaze. </PARA>
<PARA> I have become convinced that the Jawoyn people do not want Coronation Hill to be mined. I think that Senator Zakharov attempted to point out, by way of interjection, a few moments ago that, as recently as last week, the Jawoyn people came down here and spoke to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Cabinet Ministers. They pointed out that they did not want either exploration or exploitation to occur in what they regard as the sickness country, which includes Coronation Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Panizza raised that point because it was a source of great worry to me that it was very difficult to get written into the majority report protection of the potential claim which the Jawoyn people may be successful in prosecuting in relation to a land claim over the area, including Coronation Hill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wants to rely entirely on the trickery of the timing of particular provisions, when there is a serious clash of cultures in relation to the way in which decisions are made, to deny people what is their legitimate right or, should I say, potentially their legitimate right as I am not foreclosing the option that their application may be unsuccessful. But, if it is successful and takes some months to prosecute, why should those people be denied that right simply because of the time required for that process compared with the few minutes required for a signature on a piece of paper giving Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd the ability to proceed with its mining operation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the reasons which I indicated earlier, I believe that the whole of the Kakadu area, including the so-called conservation zone-it is euphemistically called a conservation zone, but it is actually a zone which has been set aside for mining exploration and includes the whole of the relevant catchment-should be set aside as a national park. The evidence is clear that it is important that that be done because the area will undergo very significant environmental changes within the lifetime of the children who only a short time ago were in the upper gallery. Of necessity there will be very significant migrations of species within that zone. If that large area is not protected, we will simply see mass extinction of species. It is unfortunate, I think, that we will find within the lifetime of many of those children who were in the gallery a moment ago many of our other smaller national parks will be simply quite incapable of doing the job for which Kakadu has been set aside. Kakadu is a World Heritage area. It is a large area. It is very worthy of protection. It is certainly not appropriate for the Opposition to attempt to impose what it calls multiple land use but which is simply a euphemism for getting in there and ripping the guts out of any piece of territory that it wishes to do that to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The utter hypocrisy of Senator Coulter's statements lies in the fact that he depends on this nation's wealth and the taxes of ordinary Australians to keep him in his state of karma and his desert experiences that we have had to endure during his speech. He never gave any credit to the Opposition for declaring Kakadu as a park. We simply heard about his pitiful desert experiences. We must not forget that those who put their name to the minority report come from the land. They have a closer attachment to the environment than he and his lousy mob of Australian Democrats have ever had. It is an insult to declare that any member of the National Party of Australia would not have an affinity with the land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join my colleagues who put down the minority report. Before discussing the report in depth, I congratulate the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, Senator Black. Quite obviously, from the great array of views that we have heard here already, he had a difficult task. He did such a great job that I think it is about time he placed himself in a good position to move to the front bench, removing a few of those non-performing Ministers, particularly those from the right wing in Victoria. Certainly Senator Black has my support in that respect. In fact, I am thinking of writing a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> A great variety of views has been expressed. The view has been put that the many untapped deposits in Kakadu, which would provide great wealth, need to be mined or exploited. There is the other extreme view that the area should be held purely as an environmental zone. The extreme view is that there should be no mining exploration at all. We consider that that is utterly unrealistic, uneconomical and out of touch with the great majority of Australians. The minority report clearly sets out a view that is a balance between the ability to maintain the park as a conservation zone-a World Heritage listed area-so we can enjoy the great features of Kakadu National Park and at the same time exploit the mineral deposits in that area. Regrettably, we were unable to hand down a unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA> The crux of the difference between the minority report and majority report lies in the very fact that we believe in multiple land use. The minority report makes that very clear and it is very decisive. We accept that Kakadu National Park is a magnificent conservation area and is one of Australia's greatest tourist attractions. That is undeniable. Of course, we uphold the rights of the Aboriginal people within the area of the Kakadu Park. However, this in no way negates the ability to exploit the great mining deposits in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the area has a very long history of multiple land use. Next to Ayers Rock, Kakadu is the second most popular tourist attraction in the Northern Territory. The popularity of the region is borne out by the statistics which show that 45,000 people visited Kakadu in 1982 and 185,000 visited the area in 1987. The Northern Territory Government has declared the importance of Kakadu as a tourist attraction. It says that Kakadu is one of the most critical components of the Northern Territory tourist industry. It is important to take note of that Government's view. We often hear from people on the other side of the House that the Northern Territory Government is very gung ho, that it always acts in favour of the mining companies and that it has no sympathy with the environment. The statement that I have just read shows that this claim is utterly false. The Northern Territory Government recognises that Kakadu National Park is of great tourist significance and of great benefit to the Northern Territory economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, some of the submissions made to the Committee were in favour of clamping down further on this great Australian tourist attraction. Disappointingly, those submissions came from the Australian Conservation Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and the Australian Heritage Commission. One of the views expressed was that recreational fishing was incompatible with the concept of a national park, and that fishing should be prohibited. Of course, not wanting to buck the extreme conservationists such as members of the Australian Conservation Foundation-the original suburban greenies-the majority report expressed sympathy for this particular view. Our report argues that recreational fishing and the national park are entirely compatible so long as over-fishing is prevented. We believe that that is a fair recommendation. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That ANPWS should, as a matter of urgency, carry out a study of the fish populations of the Park with a view to determining the impact on them of various levels of recreational fishing. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are not against looking at the matter. But we believe that fishing is compatible with the concept of a national park. Listening to Senator Coulter and other members of the Committee who are in favour of the majority report, I wonder what type of tourist attraction they want. Do they want people to drive round Kakadu National Park and view the area through bus windows? If that is the case, it is certainly a ridiculous situation. If that is the type of tourist attraction they want, the sorts of figures I have just outlined in respect of the popularity of Kakadu as a tourist attraction would decline very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report also recommends that recreational hunting be banned. This would mean that hunting of feral animals, in particular buffaloes, would not be permitted despite the threat of damage by such animals to the environment. The recommendation in the majority report is against the very recommendation of Dr Landsberg, a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation scientist. Again, I wonder what type of tourist attraction those members of the Committee in favour of the majority report are looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> The views that they hold on mining in Kakadu are just as bad as their views on the matters I have already outlined. Incredibly, the majority report failed to make any recommendations on whether the Jabiluka and Koongarra mines should go into production. That is a very sad indictment of the authors of the majority report. It is remarkable to think that after 3 1/2 years the Labor and Australian Democrats majority on the Committee were unable to come to a firm decision. By failing to make a recommendation, those responsible for drawing up the majority report have left the Government and the people of Australia in the same undecided position as they were in in 1985. What a waste of taxpayers' money and a disappointment that is. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The majority report did not contain a recommendation. Although the Committee sat for 3 1/2 years, the Government and Democrat members of the Committee could not decide whether or not they wanted mining at Jabiluka or Koongarra. I will tell the Senate a little later why they could not make a decision. But I can say for sure that the minority report contains a very firm decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will read out the majority report recommendation in which a decision was not made. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee does not make any recommendations as to whether permission should be given for the Jabiluka or Koongarra mines to go into production. A wide range of matters would need to be considered in making such recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Are we being told that the Committee never considered those matters at all? It is embarrassing that this should be the position after 3 1/2 years of investigation. The question of whether to allow mining is probably not an environmental question but a political question. This is the reason supporters of the majority report could not make a decision. We know the views that members of the Committee have on uranium mining. We know the views of Senator Collins, Senator Zakharov and Senator Coates on uranium mining. Quite obviously, they have different views. No doubt they got together in some back room deal. We know the view that Senator Coulter has on uranium. We know that he is against it too. There was a 3/2 split, so obviously they got together and said, `Let us make no decision at all. Let us dumbfound everyone'. This was a political decision-not an environmental or well-judged decision. This makes a mockery of what Senate committees are all about. One would think that Government members of the Committee could be a little at arm's length from the other place. But they are not and they never will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The report by my colleagues and I states that no compelling evidence was submitted to the Committee to sway us and that we believe that mining in those areas should go ahead. We were not swayed by any of the evidence that was presented. Therefore, we recommend that work at the two projects be approved without delay. Quite rightly, Australia cannot afford not to mine in Kakadu. The Jabiluka deposit contains a known uranium resource twice as large as Ranger and its gold deposits are the highest grade of any Australian mine. Pancontinental Mining Ltd, which holds a 65 per cent interest in the joint venture seeking to develop the Jabiluka project, told the Committee that the gross value of the resources was in excess of $A20 billion. The Koongarra project also has some equally stunning figures which show the damage being done by not proceeding with these projects. We are missing out on valuable exports to the tune of $1.7 billion and the Government alone is missing out on tax revenue of $1.76 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The most interesting statistic is the fact that the local Aboriginal people are missing out on $256m. This was never mentioned by Senator Coulter. That sort of money, if properly managed, would go a long way to helping Aboriginal people in terms of schools, health care and housing. This money would not have to go through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which we all know is an absolute shambles and mess at the moment. This is money that would go to the local Aboriginal people. In reality, this money is being denied to these people. They are being robbed of this money because of a political decision. As Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out, the local Aboriginals want uranium mining to go ahead. But they are being overridden by the authorities. The evidence of that is in the minority report. Paragraph 126 at page 297 of the minority report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Stan Tipiloura, a full-blooded Aborigine and a member of the Arafura, which contains the Koongarra and Jabiluka uranium prospects, has said as recently as June this year (1988) that his Aboriginal constituents were totally in favour of a change to the three mine uranium policy and felt they were being discriminated against:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, the shoe is on the other foot. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area under consideration to be mined for gold is Coronation Hill. It has managed to get a great deal of press of late. The joint venturers are currently in the process of preparing an environmental impact study in compliance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974. We believe that mining should go ahead in this area subject to a full and detailed environmental impact statement. We have no doubt that adequate incentives and safeguards can be built into the project. </PARA>
<PARA> An important principle must be laid down in relation to Coronation Hill and the whole conservation area-the principle of multiple land use. To enforce that principle-the ability to have multiple land use in these national parks-in recommendation 113 and 114 we have added words that deny that the only decision that has to be made in these conservation areas is a conservation decision; there are many other factors to be taken on board. But that does not seem to be the way the majority report has gone. The majority seem to think that conservation is the only element and the only reason to make a decision as to whether mining should go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, our dissenting report is founded on the belief that multiple resources use in Kakadu National Park should be permitted to the extent that the natural environment has adequate safeguards. No-one can deny that. Kakadu is an enormous area. It is about one-third the size of Tasmania. That should also be taken into consideration. It is a beautiful area. It should be made available to all Australians as a tourist attraction; and its wealth should also be made available to all Australians. </PARA>

He said that if a truck was parked outside loaded with 20 tonnes of biscuits and he went and threw on another biscuit, that would be delta biscuit, or delta load.

As soon as we got there, these people were quick to tell us that one of the retort tanks overran the night before. I think they were hoping that it would get out, but it had cement blocks around it to stop that. Their main aim seems to be criticising the mines. I believe that that Office should be removed to, say, Darwin. We should have only a few of the staff in the park on a continuous and rotating basis. This would enable them to see a bit of the outside world as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I saw no great damage being done to the environment while I was there. I speak as one who is experienced in the bush and outback and in mining. When I was in local government, there was a lot of mining in our area. Compared to what I have seen elsewhere, I consider that minimal damage has been done to the environment. If honourable senators do not already know, I am committed to the cause of multiuse of land in Australia. I believe that Kakadu National Park, just like the rest of the public ground in Australia, should be available to all, whether it is for tourism, mining or whatever other industries suit various areas. I am a great believer in that and I have always worked that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is flourishing in that area. From what I have read, there are about 200,000 visitors to that area, which surprisingly matches up with Ayers Rock and the Olgas, and various other places. As I have said, I believe that land should not be locked up. Senator Coulter has said that the areas we are discussing should be locked up for the occasional visit that he and others may make. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Zakharov" NAMEID="FE4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I heard it being said. I believe that all bush is beautiful. I believe that Kakadu is beautiful; but I believe that all bush is beautiful. Senator Coulter referred to the land at the top of South Australia. I have travelled right through there, coming right across the desert from Western Australia. One cannot find there any plants or animal life, except for the cattle in the pastoral areas. I consider that that land is all beautiful. But that does not mean that it has to be locked up from everyone. Just for the occasional visit Senator Coulter might make there to be with the stars. I would go so far as to say that if the honourable senator and others bent that way think it is that great, it should be compulsory for everyone to go out there for 12 months and stay in primitive situations. We would then see if the people back in the cushy, easy life cities, such as Senator Zakharov, want to go back there. I have had the experience of living in harsh outback areas. I think many others would think differently about mining, agriculture and whatever in those areas if they spent a little more time there. Of course, mining and tourism in those areas provide opportunities for the employment of Aborigines. In Darwin, before we went to Coronation Hill-which incidentally was run into the ground by what Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (BHP) did to it-a radical group who followed the mining group in told us that BHP was not doing the right thing and was stripping the benches. The next day we found out that these benches, which are on the side of the hill where the rigs stand, were made around 1948, when Coronation Hill was being explored for uranium. It is only in the last six or seven years that they have been exploring for gold. The benches had been re-cleared because they had grown up since that time. We were met by the management at Coronation Hill, who laid out the exploration results on the plans, although they were not too forward about giving us values. Over the years I have read a few of those results-and fortunately I am able to read upside down-and I ascertained that in some places there were up to 400 ounces of gold in a tonne of ore. It would be a crying shame, considering the foreign income we need to keep this country afloat and the social security bills we get from this Government, to think of locking up that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we were there we had a discussion with the Jawoyn people. They presented us with a petition about doing our utmost to see that this area is opened up for gold mining so that they can get jobs. About 25 people were employed on the exploration site. I spoke to many of them who were driving trucks and working on drilling rigs, as general hands, trades assistants, et cetera. They were very interested in their jobs. In fact they said that it was a pity that there were not more of these positions around so that their mates, who could not get jobs, could get out of the pubs in Katherine, where they were drinking themselves to death. I thought that was a good point. A lot more could be done for those people if jobs were made available. If Coronation Hill were to get off the ground, there are already agreements in place by which royalties would go to the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ranger uranium mine is very successful and hopefully in time we will see another two mines start up-Jabiluka and Koongarra. On the experience of Ranger alone, the Aborigines are getting roughly $15,200 per person a year. I know that that amount does not always go directly into their hands; a certain amount goes into a trust account or something similar, where it accrues interest over time. Of course, that has taken the load off the social security bill, which is getting very heavy, and is also keeping the people occupied. </PARA>
<PARA> Coronation Hill could do a lot with its natural resources. In our minority report we said that, subject to certain environmental studies being done-we already have the experience of what is happening at the Ranger mine-we do not see why Coronation Hill, as well as Jabiluka and Koongarra, should be prevented from going ahead, particularly as the risk of damage to the environment would be greater from a uranium mine than from a gold mine. In the majority report it was noted-and this was mentioned by Senator McGauran-that no recommendation was made one way or another as to whether mining should go ahead in those three places. Senator Collins from the Northern Territory has, like myself, spent a lot of time in those outback areas. He usually has a certain amount of commonsense, although when he gets to this place he probably has to put it aside. However, the Chairman admitted that the Committee was deadlocked.

<PARA> While we were there we were able to see Mudginberri, which was very interesting, as most honourable senators would remember, in that famous case the industrial relations of the animal slaughtering industry in Australia were rewritten. I noted that the Government, probably through the Northern Land Council, has finally taken over the station. A caretaker has been put in and the abattoir is now being used to slaughter the last of the buffalo. The buffalo have disappeared; the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) delights in showing people spare parts of buffaloes which have been shot from helicopters by aerial shooting parties and left to rot. It is a very cruel way of killing them. I was very sorry to see that demise because the buffalo, in its own right, is a very beautiful animal. I know that it is an introduced species, but I believe it added something to the place. It was meat for the Aborigines, and the ANPWS has now taken delight in removing it. Of course, with the buffalo gone, we had the famous quote from Senator Gareth Evans, before I came here, that that country was nothing but clapped out buffalo country. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not have much else to say on the matter, but I conclude by saying that I did enjoy being on the Committee, irrespective of the very one-sided and opposing views we got from some members of the Committee who are on the other side of the House, as well as those on my left. I would like to commend Senator Crichton-Browne for the work he did on this minority report, because he did the bulk of it. Having been on the Committee for much longer than I have, he was able to contribute much more to the writing of the minority report than I could. When I went through it I found very little to disagree with. But, of course, Senator Crichton-Browne, like me-I do not know whether honourable senators know it-has spent a lot of time in these outback areas of Western Australia. He was not the city boy that he looks like now. He has seen a lot of Australian country and he has had experience of the gold mining areas that probably members on the other side have not had. I commend him for that and I certainly commend the minority report. I found probably no more than 40 per cent of the majority report that I objected to. But my main objection was that those who wrote the majority report did not have the courage to come up with a recommendation on mining one way or the other. At least if they had come down with a recommendation that there be no mining, they would have made a decision and they could have been judged on it. But we cannot judge them because they did not make a decision at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand another report is to be presented tonight, so I will not be using my full time at this stage. I would like to raise a matter which is not related to the substance of the report or the dissenting report but to some of the material published in the dissenting report. This inquiry began as a result of a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, of which I was the Chair. Towards the end of the inquiry we were asked to hear the views of the Jawoyn people, the traditional owners of the Coronation Hill area. It was the wish of the Jawoyn community, and of the Committee, that the evidence be given in camera. As Chair, I inquired as to the security of in camera evidence and was advised then that it could be released only by resolution of the Committee or of the Senate itself. This was explained to those giving evidence, as was the belief of the then Committee that the evidence remained confidential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was therefore deeply shocked, on reading the dissenting report last week, to find that quite large sections of the evidence at that hearing were quoted verbatim in the dissenting report, and quoted selectively to support the minority's argument. I have since been advised by the Clerk that there is precedent for this action, for an independent member-in this case three senators but only one had been at that hearing-preparing a dissenting report to disclose, without reference to the Committee or to the witness, in camera evidence which the member claims in relevant to the dissent and which forms a necessary part of the reasoning of the dissent. I seek leave to incorporate that advice in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE USE OF IN CAMERA EVIDENCE IN DISSENTING REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA> The question has been raised whether a Senator, in a dissent attached to the report of a committee, may refer to or quote evidence taken by the committee in camera and not otherwise published by the committee or the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Standing order 311 provides, inter alia, that ``A protest or dissent may be added to the Report [of a committee].'' This provision applies to all committees, as standing order 37a makes clear. The standing orders contain no provisions, however, indicating the permissible content of a protest or dissent. A dissent is usually referred to as a dissenting report, and normally sets out the reasons for disagreement with the conclusions or recommendations of a committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the use of in camera evidence in a dissenting report is a difficult one, and there are strong arguments in favour of contrary conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> The question was raised in relation to the report of the Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge in 1984. All of the evidence of that committee was taken in camera and was not disclosed by the committee, and the signatories of a dissenting report wished to support their dissent with quotations from the in camera evidence other than that referred to in the committee's report. After consideration of the question, the advice then given orally to the committee was that it was permissible for a Senator to quote in camera evidence to support the Senator's dissent. This advice was accepted and followed, and a dissenting report quoted parts of otherwise undisclosed in camera evidence. It is believed that there may have been other instances of this, but specific examples have not been located. </PARA>
<PARA> In camera evidence may be published by the committee which has taken it, in its report or otherwise, and may also be published by order of the Senate. A committee, therefore, cannot give to witnesses providing evidence in camera a binding assurance that that evidence will not be disclosed. For this reason, paragraph (8) of the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 relating to the protection of witnesses provides that witnesses about to give evidence in private session are to be informed whether it is the intention of the committee to disclose the evidence and that the evidence may be disclosed by the committee or the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The disclosure of evidence taken in camera without the permission of the committee concerned or of the Senate is normally an offence, the word ``offence'' here meaning both a contempt of the Senate and a criminal offence. First, as to contempt, the unauthorised disclosure of in camera evidence is by precedent one of the established categories of contempt, and Senate standing order 308 explicitly prohibits it. The resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 setting out matters which may be treated as contempts, in paragraph (16), refers to the unauthorised disclosure of unpublished evidence. Second, as to criminal offences, the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 in section 13 creates a statutory offence of unauthorised disclosure of in camera evidence, and in sub-section 16 (4) prohibits the production in court of undisclosed in camera evidence. These statutory provisions, of course, have no application to the disclosure of evidence in the course of proceedings in Parliament, as section 16 elsewhere makes clear, and the inclusion of a dissent in a report, as section 16 also makes clear, is a proceeding in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be deduced from this that the answer to the question is in the negative, that in camera evidence may be disclosed by the committee concerned or by the Senate and not otherwise, and that the disclosure of such evidence in a dissenting report is prohibited and is a contempt. There is also a strong argument of principle in favour of a negative answer. Allowing the quotation of in camera evidence in a dissenting report has the effect of giving to one Senator a power to publish such evidence, and a decision by one Senator does not have the safeguard of a deliberate decision by a committee or the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, strong considerations in favour of an affirmative answer, and these considerations decisively influenced the advice given in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The explicit provision for a dissent to be added to a report makes a dissenting report a part of the reporting process, and in itself confers a powerful right on individual Senators. In effect, it may be seen as providing another method whereby the authorised disclosure of evidence may take place. It may be essential for a dissenting Senator to refer to undisclosed evidence in order to make out the dissent, and it would be objectionable in principle to allow the majority of a committee to withhold the evidence which may be vital for the exercise of the right of dissent. That right may be effectively nullified by the suppression of some evidence by the majority. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Houses of Parliament, including the British and Canadian Houses of Commons, the New Zealand House of Representatives and the Australian House of Representatives before 1978, do or did not allow committee members to make dissenting reports, for the reason that this gives too great a power to an individual member. In those Houses, the prohibition on dissenting reports is often circumvented by the submission of alternative draft reports or amendments to the chairman's draft, which are included in the minutes attached to the report, and the same device might perhaps be used to disclose in camera evidence. It may well be argued that, in giving the right of dissent to its members, the Senate has conferred a right for individual members to make use of a committee's evidence for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> An insistence on a dissenting Senator obtaining the permission of the committee or the Senate before quoting or describing in camera evidence in a dissent, unless permission were routinely granted, could well give rise to artificial situations which could not long persist. A statement in a dissent that it was supported by undisclosed evidence would inevitably give rise to a demand for the production of the evidence. Subsequent debate would probably be such as to compel the committee or the Senate to disclose the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> It must not be thought that this reasoning gives to each member of a committee a discretion to disclose in camera evidence. The disclosure must be only in the context of a dissenting report. A member could not add an attachment to a report which contains no dissent from the committee's recommendations or conclusions but which merely quotes in camera evidence. Moreover, the disclosure of evidence must be clearly relevant to the matters in respect of which the Senator dissents and must be a necessary part of the reasoning of the dissent. A Senator could not simply include in camera evidence in a dissenting report as an addition not strictly related to the dissent; to do so would be an unauthorised disclosure of the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, I consider that the balance of argument lies in favour of an affirmative answer. I would therefore confirm the advice previously given. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that the Senate has not explicitly determined the matter. By accepting the report of the 1984 select committee, and perhaps other reports, the Senate may be said to have tacitly accepted the view here expressed. A definite contrary decision would have the effect of overturning the precedent.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FE4">Senator ZAKHAROV</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Had the former Committee known at the time that this was possible, it is likely we may not have proceeded with the hearing. We are now faced with an untenable situation. The Committee had already decided earlier this year not to release the evidence and therefore did not quote it in the majority report. On the other hand, I cannot use other material from that transcript to refute the evidence already quoted selectively in the dissenting report in support of its case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon Senator Crichton-Browne, in his interjection, said that this was not in camera evidence. If that were so, there would have been no need for the Committee to consider the matter of acceding to a request to release the evidence-incidentally, I think that request came from the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-earlier this year and for the Committee then to deny that request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not because I had the numbers. If the honourable senator looks at the transcript of that evidence he will see it is clearly marked `in camera'. Incidentally, this is not the only place in the dissenting report where in camera evidence is quoted. The transcript of a video presented by Mr Stephen Davis was incorporated at an in camera hearing in Darwin and it has also been quoted at length. In this case the minority would undoubtedly have had approval of the witness to release the evidence, but the Committee made no such decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is also a wider, very serious implication, and it was averted to earlier by Senator Coulter. If committees cannot guarantee that any one of their members will not break the trust of a witness that his or her evidence remain private, then such witness will be very unwilling to give evidence for fear of endangering his or her employment or even safety. I believe this matter to be extremely serious and to warrant the attention of the Committee of Privileges, to find some way to ensure that witnesses in the future are protected from action that, although extremely unethical in my view, apparently does not breach privilege. </PARA>

She also said, just a few moments ago, that I was unethical. I resent that imputation.

The difficulty I have, as I am sure Senator Tate will understand, is that I cannot go to the heart of the claim of unethical conduct without demonstrating why it was ethical. If the Senate will bear with me, that is what I am trying to demonstrate. This matter is relevant. I quote from the relevant part of the letter to the Jawoyn people:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As requested, this will be a private meeting with the Jawoyn, not a public hearing (although I understand from our discussions that the Jawoyn would see no problem if the transcript were made publicly available at a later stage). </PARA>

<PARA>The evidence being taken this morning is in camera evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Townley then interrupted and said that it was a private meeting, not in camera. The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA>There may be parts that will be in camera. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Townley then said:</PARA>
<PARA>But this is not in camera as I understand it. I said that I would not agree to it being in camera. This is a private meeting with the transcipt to be released following this meeting, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA>Will you let me finish and explain what we have been advised. This means that none of us here are permitted to tell other people what was said in this meeting. If the Committee wants to release any of the evidence at a later stage, it would consult you first. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Townley said that he was not happy with that and that it was not an in camera meeting. The Chairman said that the evidence was to be released. If I may paraphrase, Senator Townley went on to give his understanding of the position, which was that the meeting was private to the extent that it allowed the Aboriginal community to give evidence without fear of intimidation by the presence of other people. It was not that the evidence was to be in camera. Debate went on with Senator Townley saying that it was not to be an in camera meeting. Without going through all the evidence, I concluded by saying, referring to the Jawoyn people:</PARA>
<PARA>They are not asking that the evidence, once given, be in camera, but rather that its presentation be in camera. </PARA>
<PARA>End of discussion-and there was no doubt in my mind, nor was there any doubt in Senator Townley's mind or anybody else's, that when that evidence was taken it was not in camera. I would not have agreed, Senator Townley would not have agreed, and there would have been no quorum, and there would have been no evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it quite clear that there is nothing unethical about that, there is no trickery about it-the evidence was not in camera. There was a meeting subsequently where it was asked for the evidence to be released. I said at that time, and it is on the record, that the evidence was not in camera and that I would never agree to its being in camera, and so far as I was concerned it was available to the public. I will not impugn the integrity of others, but I am rapidly being drawn to the conclusion that there is another reason for this evidence not being made available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's 1987 policy information paper entitled `The Defence of Australia' identified the men and women of the Australian Defence Force as that force's `most valuable asset' and `a vital resource in the security of Australia'. It follows, therefore, that personnel wastage-that is, loss rates-which exceed certain numerical and qualitative levels will be harmful to the national defence effort. Given that wastage rates in the Australian Defence Force have for several years now significantly exceeded historical levels, this report by the Joint Committee is, I believe, topical and important. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry attracted a great deal of armed service, public, academic and media interest. Some 226 written submissions were received, compared with the 35 and 26 respectively for this Committee's preceding two inquiries into defence matters. Public hearings and meetings were held in many different localities across Australia. Overall, more than 4,000 pages of evidence were collected. </PARA>
<PARA> Committee members found that, throughout the Australian Defence Force, servicemen and women were keenly aware of the personnel wastage issue, usually held an opinion on the subject and were keen to discuss it. During the course of the inquiry Committee members concluded that personnel wastage is the most pressing matter facing the Defence Force. It is an issue which requires prompt but at the same time considered resolution. I seek leave to incorporate the balance of my remarks in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>In order to achieve that end many individuals have worked with considerable dedication over the past 12 months. We would like to acknowledge their contribution and express our thanks. On behalf of the Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee, Mr Cross, M.P., I should like to record his appreciation of the efforts of his Subcommittee colleagues, who between them spent hundreds of hours working on what has been a most demanding inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>We would also like to thank those who presented evidence and submissions; in particular, the co-operation of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly), the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Chief of the Defence Force, was appreciated. The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge the contribution made by our staff, in particular our secretary Mr Alan Stephens and word processor operator Ms Kylie Freer. We are also indebted to the main Committee, its chairman Mr Gordon Bilney and secretary Mr Peter Gibson. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the Committee's Main Findings, I believe it is important to comment, first, on the nature of this inquiry, and, second, on the higher management of the Defence Force. The subject matter has made this a difficult inquiry. Throughout its deliberations the Committee has been aware of the fact that there is a persistent negative overtone inherent in the topic. If people are asked what is wrong with their organisation and why they are leaving it, then that is precisely the kind of information they will provide; they are unlikely to say much about the positive aspects of their employment. Because of the terms of reference this report unavoidably is a critical examination of defence personnel management. We believe that is proper, as the question of wastage rates in the ADF has been of concern to this Committee for some years. The very fact that we accepted the subject for inquiry is indicative of widespread public concern. The Committee also believes that while at a superficial level the inquiry may appear to have been a somewhat negative process, it has been necessary and in the long-term will be of significant benefit to the ADF and the Government. Personnel wastage has been the subject of considerable media attention; indeed, the extent of that attention may even have contributed to wastage. This inquiry has opened up a vexed and contentious issue. In the long term that process will be in the best interests of the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the critical nature of the reference, Committee members wish emphatically to place on record their respect for the ADF and its members. As an organisation the ADF has attractions which few others can match. It offers comradeship, a sense of adventure, and opportunities to develop both leadership and specialist skills. Above all, it has a compelling ethos of service. During our visits to many ADF establishments and in our discussions with thousands of service men and women, we were continually aware of the high quality and commitment of those people. The Committee's report should be read with those admirable features of the ADF and its members clearly in mind. As far as the higher management and direction of the Defence Force is concerned, several important points must be made. In the form of the 1987 White Paper, the ADF has for the first time in decades a logical and coherent policy guidance document against which force development can be directed and assessed. That document has been widely endorsed within the defence community. The central role played by the present Minister for Defence in the development and implementation of that policy deserves the high praise which it has in fact attracted. The Joint Committee supports the re-equipment of the ADF as detailed in the White Paper. Since mid-1987, the Minister and the ADF have been supported by an energetic and committed Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Again, it is widely accepted that without her untiring efforts, many of the conditions of service improvements which have been effected in the past 12 months simply would not have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are, very briefly, perhaps the major positive aspects of recent higher defence management. I believe it is most important to note that they have taken place not only against a background of years of benign neglect of our Defence Force by previous governments, but also during what currently is a period of extreme financial constraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to turn to the Committee's major findings. Like all other government activities, defence must compete for a finite pool of resources. Within the defence vote itself there is intense competition for a limited number of dollars. Personnel costs must be evaluated against bids for capital equipment, capital facilities, operating costs, defence co-operation programs, and so on. Senior management must decide whether, at a particular time, one or more functions can perhaps be reduced to a level which may be below their historical average. Such decisions should be taken only after a rigorous appraisal of Australia's strategic circumstances and should be consistent with the broader long-term interests of national security. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be argued that if Australia's defence managers consider that a particular wastage rate is acceptable within the context of our strategic circumstances and broader defence planning then, whatever that rate may be, there is no problem. Such an argument would be facile, for while statistics are an essential management tool, the examination of mere numbers is not in itself sufficient. Any worthwhile analysis of wastage must come to grips with the more subjective, but vital, factors of defence force quality and effectiveness. A central issue there is the pattern of wastage, that is, who is leaving and when. It is also important to remember that the lead time to replace a highly skilled and trained individual can be at least as long as that required to introduce into service an item of capital equipment. A controlled, manageable personnel separation rate is essential if the ADF's operational capability is to be maintained at the necessary standard. Against that background, and after careful consideration of a great deal of evidence, the Committee has concluded that the present level of wastage in the ADF is far too high and has been so for some time. Further, there has been a clear and consistent trend towards this situation for several years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not support the Department of Defence's conclusion that wastage is of concern only in some specific specialist areas. That kind of assessment pays insufficient attention to the qualitative aspects of wastage, as well as understating the overall effect and extent of numerical losses. Our assessment is that there is cause for concern across a wide range of ranks and skills. The extent and magnitude of wastage in some areas is such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. In sum, the effects of wastage identified by the Joint Committee amount to a loss of operational capability. It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. Wastage is undermining the experience and competence levels of personnel. It is impacting on the capacity of the training and personnel management systems to maintain the force's integrity. The financial cost arising from the abnormal loss of skilled staff and the increased training effort is enormous. At the psychological level, morale in some areas is lower than normal, and the potential has been created for institutional polarisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Having reached that conclusion, the Joint Committee would like to emphasise that, in its judgment, the ADF remains a capable organisation, staffed by many high quality and committed individuals. The force continues to attract praise for its performance in allied exercises. It operates high technology equipment with skill and, as demonstrated by the contingency preparations to evacuate Australians from Fiji in May 1987, can respond rapidly and effectively. Nevertheless, the nation's senior professional single service military leaders have all acknowledged that the current high wastage rates have reduced capabilities. Those judgments were confirmed by the Chief of the Defence Force when he appeared before the Joint Committee. It is clear that, under the existing organisational structure, capabilities will continue to diminish if wastage remains high. The greater part of the Joint Committee's examination of personnel wastage was spent assisting measures to resolve that unsatisfactory circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee has presented a range of recommendations which, if addressed vigorously and constructively, should enable the Government to reduce wastage to acceptable, more manageable levels. Those recommendations-of which there are 48 in all-are too detailed to discuss at length here. However, in broad terms, they encompass the following areas: policy, leadership and morale; career satisfaction and personnel management; the service family; and conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA> A point of particular significance is that, in general, service men and women who leave the ADF before completing what might be considered a full military career tend to do so for the same reasons, regardless of rank or skill category. For example, while much media attention has focused on the salaries which airlines offer Air Force pilots-salaries which the ADF cannot hope to match-the reality is that pay is only one of a number of factors which influence a decision to separate, even for those who can command much larger wages outside the Defence Force. Changing community values mean that senior defence management must remain dynamic and responsive to change. If the expectations of service men and women are not met on such issues as, for example, job satisfaction, good housing, work opportunities for spouses and dependants, and child care, then retaining the right people in the force is likely to remain a problem. Across the ADF, the kinds of issues I have mentioned affect all service men and women. It is unlikely that one issue by itself will trigger a resignation; rather, it is probable that a combination of events will eventually generate the critical level of dissatisfaction. We believe, therefore, that it will be necessary for the ADF's senior management to adopt a wide-ranging and coordinated strategy to resolve this fundamental problem. Addressing issues in isolation is unlikely to produce a satisfactory long-term outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also essential that the system by which the ADF's men and women are rewarded for their service recognises the unique nature of the ADF and the special circumstances under which Defence Force personnel and their families live and work. The recognition of those often onerous circumstances must include a substantial element of compensation through a wide range of conditions of service entitlements. The majority of the Committee's recommendations could be implemented at little or no extra cost to the defence budget. In many cases, determined and innovative management within the ADF and the Department of Defence could do the job. Nevertheless, it is clear that there will need to be either an extra allocation, or a reallocation, of resources to service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to conclude by reiterating that this comprehensive and detailed report is the end result of a great deal of effort by a large number of individuals. That effort is indicative of the Committee's concern over the present level of personnel wastage in the ADF and our commitment both to national security and the men and women of the Defence Force. The Committee believes that continuing, vigorous action is necessary to control the present level of personnel wastage in the ADF which, under the existing organisation arrangements, is excessive and inimical to national defence. The recommendations presented in this report have been framed to achieve that positive objective. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Before I deal with the report in detail, I wish to express my thanks as Deputy Chairman of the Committee to my colleagues, those senators and members of the Committee who took an active part in the report. I must make individual reference to Manfred Cross, the Chairman, who conscientiously and resolutely, objectively and impartially kept faith with the Parliament by keeping the Committee moving. I also thank Alan Stephens who, as Secretary to the Committee, rendered the most outstanding service I have experienced in nearly 11 years of service on many Senate and joint parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to thank the witnesses who wrote to or appeared before the Committee. The Committee received over 220 submissions, a record, which demonstrates the great concern of the armed services in this matter. The Parliament is indeed indebted to those men and women who were prepared to speak out in public, sometimes at possible risk to their careers. It is no secret that the Government was not in favour of this parliamentary inquiry. It did all it could in a covert way to delay or avoid the setting up of this inquiry. However, the wish of the Parliament prevailed, the inquiry was set up and the Government gave the Committee its fullest cooperation in the most honourable way through the course of the inquiry. The report before us today has the unanimous support of all the members of the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party who served on the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was an excellent chairman, as I said a few moments ago, as the Minister would realise had he been paying attention. There was no dissension when the evidence was analysed and the conclusions drawn. The Defence Committee is closely involved with the three Services. In its report the Committee draws attention to problems they are experiencing. Comment is made on actions by the Government and the Services which contribute to the present condition. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need to maintain a balanced perspective with respect to the ADF. It has many problems. Those problems are mostly not of its making. With the right actions by the Government the ADF will get out of those problems in time. At present, even though the ADF's capabilities are reduced, the personnel concerned are as fine a body of men and women as ever wore the uniforms of the armed services. They are superb professionals, as good as any country's. We, the community, owe them a great debt for the way, with discipline and dedication, they have endured their troubles and continue to serve this country. They deserve not only our gratitude but our help and support. Let us not fail them again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report deals with the crisis in the Australian defence forces-a crisis the manifestation of which is record and unprecedented resignation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Australian Labor Party came to office a little over five years ago, over 45,000 men and women, out of a force of about 70,000, have voted with their feet and left the Services. In sheer numbers, in quantitative terms, we have never seen anything like this. Not only is it a quantitative problem but also it has profound qualitative connotations. The record resignations of the fully trained and experienced professionals, the key people-the people with 10 or 15 years service who are at the core of the operational capabilities of all three Services-are the ones who have gone as well. I refer to people such as company commanders, battalion commanders in the Army; pilots in strike and fighter squadrons; and captains in the Navy. It is the loss of these people in such numbers which is the really crippling effect of the present resignation crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences? The first and most obvious one is the lack of capability in an operational sense for our forces. Ships' captains, battalion commanders and pilots all require skill and judgment-the products of experience. This is experience which takes many years to acquire. No emergency training program can supply the experience that comes from eight or 18 years. That pool of experience has now gone. It is best illustrated by the pilots but in no sense are they an isolated example. Against an average loss for Australia and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) of 47 pilots per year-42 before the present crisis-we had 70 pilots resign in 1985-86; 107 in 1986-87; 123 in 1987-88; and in the first six weeks of this financial year 42 pilots indicated their wish to terminate. We have lost 300 pilots in only three years. At best our training capacity will produce only between 55 to 65 pilots per year. </PARA>
<PARA> We have lost great capabilities in all three Services. More importantly, it will be the better part of a decade before we can re-establish that experience we have lost; that is presuming the Government takes effective action at this time. I was pleased to see in the tabling statement of the Committee Chairman in the other place that reference was made to the grievous loss of capacity and capability. He also said that we have lost that for at least a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The second consequence of this high loss rate is a grossly inflated training cost. Since far more people than normal are leaving, not only does the average level of experience within the units fall but also unduly large resources, both in manpower and materiel, have to be devoted to training. That means transferring personnel from operational roles to training roles and transferring money which should be spent on exercises and operational training into basic training. Both of those moves are very expensive, particularly when defence budgets are falling. It is no exaggeration to say that the real cost to taxpayers over the last five years of record resignation rates is measured in terms of billions of dollars. Of the 300 pilots who left-160 more resigned than would have resigned in the average run of events-the total value of their training, conservatively estimated at about $5m each, represents a real loss to the taxpayer of over $800m. This unnecessary cost has to be borne at a time not only of reduced defence budgets but also of negative budget growth. It is not that the budgets have failed to keep pace with inflation; they are actually being reduced. All this is going on when the great predictability of the region has changed. We live in uncertain political times in the region, as the events in Fiji and Papua New Guinea testify. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we get into this position? Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of different reasons were advanced to the Committee. They are discussed in detail in the report. Nearly all of those reasons can be traced back to one central failing: the lack of leadership in the political area; primarily in the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the present Government, but secondly in the Parliament as a whole. In the bluntest of terms, too many of the men and women in the armed Services feel that no one in the Government appreciates what they are doing. If people are not valued for their sacrifices-life in the Services cannot be compared with civilian callings-they will find fault with the surroundings. It is so easy to transfer feelings of unease into complaints about poor housing, frequent transfers, interrupted schooling, long hours on duty and inadequate pay and allowances, particularly when the major shortcomings in many of the conditions of service can be so readily demonstrated today. Those are not the real reasons; those are the excuses that people who are leaving give. </PARA>
<PARA> The Services need strong leadership in the Parliament, just as they need it in their own ranks. It is a fundamental characteristic of Australia: there is a lack of leadership in the present Minister for Defence and in the Government. There is also confusion between management and leadership. The two are not the same, despite what the Minister thinks. Leadership involves many qualities. It involves an intimate knowledge of the task to be performed. It involves the ability to plan, to inform, and to inspire men and women to make the effort and the sacrifices to achieve the goal. Leadership generates the purpose that comes from the pursuit of a worthy ideal. The Australian Defence Force is foundering because of the lack of a coherent conceptual framework within which it can exist. The whole purpose of our Defence Force today is defined within the narrow confines set by what the Government is prepared to spend on it-not by what needs to be spent for national security. </PARA>
<PARA> Not one of the senior officers in any of the three Services believes in the infantile doctrine of credible contingencies and no threats for 10 years which now drives our defence planning. These people are professionals. They know that no one can foresee the future and the nature and timing of future events. They know that armed combat between nations is a very serious matter, not lightly undertaken by an attacking power. If Australia needs its armed forces it will need the highest level of capabilities, not a mere police force. This dishonesty and immorality in the present position comes from the fact that the Government will not put enough money into defence, so a low threat scenario is created. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for defence has declined. The report shows how the percentage of the defence vote devoted to capital equipment and facilities has grown from 18.2 per cent to 29.6 per cent over the last 10 years, while personnel costs have fallen from 54.3 per cent to 42.8 per cent. At the same time, the total defence vote has actually declined. In the past three years the growth rate was positive only in 1985-86 when a growth of 2.9 per cent occurred. In 1986-87 there was a decrease of 0.4 per cent in real terms. In 1987-88 there was a decrease of 1 per cent. The balance between new equipment and personnel is wrong. That is the second great causative factor in resignations because there is just not enough money for the men and women in the Services to give them the conditions and the operational training they joined the Services for. I am the first to agree that it is necessary to spend money on new equipment but it is just as necessary to spend it on the welfare of service personnel. In an emergency, money is always available. The latest equipment can always be bought. However, without the personnel to use that equipment, we are lost. It is all in vain. That is where this Government is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Ten years ago it was foreseen that in this period, the middle of the 1980s through to the middle of the 1990s, very large amounts of money would be required for equipment. The Department of Defence made its plans to provide adequate funding for that circumstance. This Labor Government approved these plans, but it welshed on the deal, as it has on so many others. In 1984, two years after taking office, this Government approved the 1984-89 five-year defence plan, which provided for a 4.5 per cent real growth in defence outlays each year beyond 1984-85. That was the minimal figure required to run the program. But this growth of 4.5 per cent in real terms for the five years from 1984 to 1989 has never been obtained, even if we accept the dubious 1 per cent to 2 per cent savings which are claimed to have been made in outgoings. Because the Government is locked into inflexible contractual obligations for new equipment, it is the human factor which has had to be sacrificed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the significant features of the present crisis is that the Government had plenty of warning of what was going to happen. The only thing that can be said in its defence is that it clearly received inadequate-perhaps even incompetent-advice from the senior civilian elements of the Department of Defence. Sadly, there are some senior officials still there who still have not realised the enormity of the problem that faces us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's first reaction to the resignation crisis was to pretend that the problem did not exist. It embarked on a cover-up, but eventually the truth came out. The Government's early statements were that the original resignation rates were running marginally above average, conveniently overlooking the fact that each fraction of a percentage increase represented very big numbers. The Minister for Defence strenuously protested that there were no problems. On 3 March 1987 on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 7.30 Report he replied to a question:</PARA>
<PARA>Sir, how serious would you regard this manpower drain?</PARA>
<PARA> Minister-I would regard it as unacceptable, not a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>This view was repeated many times, particularly by his colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly). On 25 August 1987, in a scintillating display of profound comprehension of the problem, this Minister even went so far as to say that high resignation rates were good for morale. No wonder Senator Tate is cradling his head in his hands, because the direct converse is true. </PARA>
<PARA> Forced to concede eventually that the problem existed, the next move of the Government was to shoot the bearers of bad news. Comments by informed observers, like myself, on continually rising resignation rates were attacked on the grounds that it was the commentators who were responsible for the problem because they were drawing attention to it. Current Government propaganda is that we have now turned the corner; the worst is over; and in a short while everything will be rosy again. That has been the gist of the press releases put out yesterday in an attempt to exercise some damage control over the release of this report. Sadly for Australia, the latest figures on resignation rates show no proof of this assertion whatsoever. The situation is just as bad as it was some months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of what the Government has done, I have taken a particular interest in the debates and the press conference held in this building today on this report, and I am more than a little amused at the way the standard defence of the Government to the situation of the mess we are in is that it is an inherited situation. That is false on two grounds. Sadly for Australia, we have had a Labor Government in the Federal arena for the last 5 1/2 years. On the basis that a week is a long time in politics, 5 1/2 years is long enough for the Government to have cleared up any problem that it inherited. The Government has had the initiative. It is the Government's policies that have led us into the mess we are in. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic assertion that the Government inherited troubles with respect to resignation rates is absolutely false. Having spent a lot of time looking at statistics for resignation rates in the armed services over the last two or three decades, I can say that when this Government came to power resignation rates for all three services were at the lowest level they had been for many a long day. This Government inherited a very stable and satisfied Defence Force manpower situation, and the figures today give the lie to the assertion that it inherited precisely the same or remotely comparable circumstances to those that exist at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Along the way the Government has made some efforts to get on top of the problem. Some measures have been successful and worthwhile, and I pay full tribute to those, like the implementation of the Hamilton report on the Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses, and the things that have been done on defence housing. Other schemes, like the pilot's retention bonus, which was conceived in blind panic, were not only disastrous failures but positively harmful to the defence forces. Overall, the lack of coherent approach has allowed the position to continue unabated. In many ways the haemorrhage is continuing, and the only thing that will stop the outflow of blood from the body corporate of the Australian defence forces is the fact that we have run out of blood. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with the Government's action, or inactions, the report also looks at shortcomings within the defence forces themselves. We note that there is clearly a need for the development of a professional personnel division within the armed services. There are matters in relation to conditions of service which are under the control of the individual services which can be improved, and we have drawn notice to them. One of the central problems remains the Russell Hill complex, the civilian-military bureaucracy and its extremely wasteful diarchic structure with its duplication and confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> The last report of my Committee, entitled The Management of Australia's Defence Forces, dealt with the great and serious problem this monster presents, Despite the compelling logic of our last report, the Minister for Defence treated it, and therefore, by inference, the Parliament, with contempt, and has done nothing to correct the situation. As well as all the problems in an organisational and managerial sense that the Russell Hill complex creates, directly and indirectly, it makes its own positive contribution to increasing resignation rates because senior service personnel do not want to be locked up there for years. It is not what they joined the services for. The joined to fight the enemies of Australia, not the Australian Public Service. But the problems of the Russell Hill complex are problems that only this Government can fix. No committee can do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this report to the Senate-all 400-odd pages of it. It deals with matters of vital importance to Australia's security. Regrettably, because of what has been going on for years and the numbers of resignations being so large, we have become anaesthetised to both the magnitude and the importance of the huge resignation rates in the Australian Defence Force. The press is not interested; the Government is not interested. I believe it passes their comprehension. We have suffered grievously. At worst, the security of our country has been put at risk. At best, we have pointlessly lost billions of dollars at a time when we are deeply in debt. There is a great parallel between the way the Government has handled the economy and the way it has handled defence. In the economy, the Government came to office with a national debt of $32,000m. Today, over five years later, it is more than $125,000m-all to be repaid by future generations of Australians. This huge legacy has been hidden from the public by the subterfuge of focusing attention on an internal balanced budget achieved by excessive and rapacious taxation and hiding the true indebtedness of the country from the population at large. </PARA>
<PARA> The report clearly shows the magnitude of the resignation problem, the length of time over which it has been operating and the responses by the Government. But not only have the corrective responses by the Government been deficient. As great a deficiency has been the failure of the Government to take any remedial action to compensate for these huge losses in numbers. Not one cent has been added to the defence budget so that more training can take place to bridge the gap in experience that we are now suffering from-not one cent for the most elementary process. Australia's national security has been gravely compromised by the neglect this Government shows for defence. If nothing is done we will lose the vestigial capabilities that are in the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the fundamental principles of a responsible government that someone takes responsibility for actions. In this case it is the Minister for Defence who has knowingly tolerated, or been unable to correct, the dangerous loss of capability that the Australian Defence Force has suffered. There is no point in blaming the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. She is only a decoy. Her position was created in a cynical act by this Government to draw responsibility for this debacle away from its rightful source-the Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley. Never in our history have we had as great and as sorry a record of failure from any Minister for Defence as the present one. He must accept full responsibility for this. He must tender his resignation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any Australian who is seriously concerned about the defence of our nation must be deeply and gravely disturbed by the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The report identifies a distressing problem in personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force (ADF). It recommends a number of measures to deal with the problem. Many of these might be appropriate. However, the report, from an Australian Democrats perspective, fails to consider a fundamental question. It fails to address the question of how Australia and the Australian Defence Force can be a dynamic institution in an age when conflict concerning Australia directly will either be nuclear, and our Defence Force pointless, or at a very low conventional level in our northern shores and our immediate region. In other words, our Defence Force lacks a sense of purpose, a sense of usefulness, because the raison d'etre is that of a military force conceived in previous decades. Yet it will not be engaged in those sorts of actions that Australian forces have been involved in in the past. This sense of uselessness leads to low morale and wastage. To overcome this the Australian Democrats would urge a model for defence forces that gave them a greater range of ongoing non-military tasks and a greater sense of relevance. In that way defence personnel would feel that they could make an ongoing contribution to our community. They will have a sense of relevance and the devastating personnel wastage that it has cited, documented and measured page after page-in fact, for 400 pages-in this report will have some opportunity of coming to an end. This document cites some extraordinary contradictions of profound significance. I will quote and cite some of these contradictions briefly. The document says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee does not support the Department of Defence's conclusion that wastage is of concern only in some specific areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Its assessment is that there is cause for concern across a wide range of ranks and skills within the Services. In other words, the Committee sees the problem of wastage as having its base or its origin across the whole of the defence Services. One might consider here and cite by contrast the view of the 1988-87 Department of Defence report. In the foreword to that report the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) draws attention to the issue of separations from the Australian Defence Force. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Defence Force personnel wastage issue have also been of high priority for the defence organisation and the nature and extent of separations has been given particular attention. </PARA>
<PARA>However in the report tabled here today the Committee shies away from trying to paint too black a picture of the problem. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The current overall rate of separations has not affected the ADF's ability to meet its obligations although at present there are shortages in specific job categories, for instance, RAAF pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>I fail to see how this Committee can say that the wastage problem does not detract from the ADF's ability to meet its obligations. What does it see as the obligations of the Australian Defence Force if it is not the defence of this nation? On the other hand, it says that there are insufficient pilots to put our aircraft into the air. That is a blatant contradiction within a few short pages of the introductory sections of the report. It had to resort to the payment of a once-only offer of $70,000 to Royal Australian Air Force pilots to retain them in the defence forces. How short-sighted can it be in its approach to defence service personnel wastage if on the one hand people who are sitting in one machine are given a $70,000 payment while people sitting in other machines, such as tanks or personnel carriers-or it might be someone sitting in the office next to the pilots-are not offered an accommodating equivalent, or at least a partially equivalent, payment? It was a ludicrous, short-sighted, pathetic and morale destroying approach to offer those pilots that once only payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The source of low morale within the Services has been documented previously and cited by Senator MacGibbon. It has been documented in this report. It covers aspects of policy, leadership and morale. It covers aspects of civilianisation of manpower. The report cites limitations to career satisfaction and personnel management, limitations of training, poor quality of equipment and personal and camping equipment. It cites limitations of career management. It cites the unacceptable life circumstances of service personnel. In the final analysis the fault lies with the fundamental structure of the Australian Defence Force. It lies in the fact that there is a malignant sense of irrelevance that has been permeating the defence forces for several decades. It lies in the fact that this report does not address those problems. The Minister has not addressed the problems at any stage. The Minister does not even acknowledge the fact that if we are to turn around these problems of wastage and morale we must think laterally and make profound changes to the manner in which we organise our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago I listened on New South Wales radio to appeals for personnel and funds to man our volunteer bush fire brigades which are defending the southern suburbs of Sydney against attack from bushfires. At the same time as we are spending $7.6 billion a year to fund a virtually impotent and demoralised defence force we are funding our volunteer coastal patrols, our coastal surveillance and our bushfire brigades by selling lamingtons on street corners. The Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence are moribund, incapable of thinking laterally, and incapable of thinking positively and constructively about how we can reorganise into the 1990s, and indeed into the next century, a defence force which will have some sense of relevance. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 I resigned from the Australian Army out of a sense of utter irrelevance. I asked myself, after having been in the Australian Army for a decade, what I was doing with my life and what was the relevance of what I did on a day to day basis. The answer was such that I had no alternative, even back in 1974, to be on the forward edge of the thousands-now tens of thousands-of service personnel who have resigned out of a sense of absolute irrelevance to community needs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I believe that it calls for a different type of thinking. In fact, it is a type of thinking that is quite widely spread across Western society. I have put together a document which cites alternative structures and approaches to defence forces in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Spain, all of which are now thinking quite differently about how to put together peacetime defence forces. They are not locked into models which are based on First World War, Second World War, Korea and Vietnam mentalities. We have to think in terms of the next 50 years if we are to come up with the relevant structures. For instance, Austria's defence forces are used in a diversity, a multiplicity, of civil roles such as mountain and air-sea rescue, frontier police, disaster relief, police reinforcement and fire reinforcement. In Belgium they are used for disaster relief; in Denmark, mountain and air rescue, air-sea rescue, coastguards and disaster relief. We can go through Finland, France, Greece, et cetera with similar examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have stood up in this place on at least five or six occasions and pleaded with the Government and the Minister for Defence to put in front of them a blank sheet of paper and say, `Let us start thinking constructively about how to put together a civil-military defence force which will give serving personnel a sense of relevance, which will give us value for the $7.6 billion a year that we spend on our utterly impotent and demoralised Defence Force and which will render unnecessary the radio pleas such as were heard last week for personnel to go into volunteer bushfire brigades to defend our major cities'. If there is any truth in the greenhouse effect and in the fact that we will be confronted, summer after summer, with much more challenging and profound bushfires-even more challenging than the devastating Ash Wednesday fire of several years ago-the Department of Defence simply has to address seriously these alternative models. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up any more of the Senate's time. I believe that the Senate would be doing the Australian people and indeed this Government a service if, in the very near future, it created an opportunity to debate-I undertake to create that opportunity by proposing a serious urgency debate-alternative defence models. We must do so very soon. The evidence of the need is this document and the previous document of similar magnitude which was tabled in this chamber three or four months ago, that is, the 1987-88 annual report of the Department of Defence. We simply cannot go on turning our back on this problem and say, as the report suggests:</PARA>
<PARA>The current overall rate of separations has not affected the ADF's ability to meet its obligations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it has seriously affected its ability to meet its obligations. If it has not, we do not see it as having any obligations. Otherwise it is just a blatant contradiction in logic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For servicemen, I believe that satisfaction comes from knowing that they are doing an important job and that the people of Australia and the Federal Government stand behind them. The fact that this report has had to be compiled, has had to take the time of parliamentarians and has had to be addressed in a very serious manner across the whole of the community highlights the fact that at the moment the wastage or resignations-the compounding factors of unnecessary resignations from the Australian Defence Force-comes essentially from the fact that servicemen do not feel that they can either get satisfaction or know with confidence that this Federal Government stands behind them. In that respect, the report is very timely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It contains, necessarily, some 48 recommendations. What a damning condemnation that is of a government, which has been in office for five years, by a very significant proportion of the Public Service work force. Let us face it; there is a Public Service component for all servicemen in Australia with which they identify. The fact is that a parliamentary report has been under consideration for many months. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have been a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which compiled this report and undertook the work right around Australia. It is important to note in the report that some 226 individual and specific submissions were received by the committee of inquiry. As I recall, just about every one of those was from a serving serviceman, past serviceman, service representative organisation or academic with a specific interest in military and defence matters. Sure, there were a few important contributions from the forces themselves and the Department of Defence; but it was interesting to note that on several occasions the Department of Defence had to come back before the Committee and revise the evidence that it had presented initially in light of the submissions that had been made by other people or groups as the matter emerged. The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, were tardy in their representations to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that so little has happened, despite the public debate on this major issue, over the 12 months or so that is has been actively considered by this Parliament is again a further damning condemnation of this Government. Mrs Kelly had the audacity today to stand up in the House of Representatives and say that the problems were being created by the Opposition in this Parliament or by the public debate. What utter hypocrisy! Each problem has been identified in the report because it has not been addressed by government attention and government action-action that has been required of this Labor Government for five years. The Government has been bankrupt in dealing with Australia's defence forces. It has concentrated far too much on looking at equipment and not at people. Probably it had a preconception when it came to office that service personnel did not like the Labor Government's policies and it was just another arena that it chose to get stuck into because it believed that it did not win votes from that area. I know, from the significant number of Defence Force personnel in my electorate, that that is not true. Servicemen vote in patterns similar to just about every other group in the community. Their social and political priorities are no different from those of the general Australian community. But what they do want is confidence in their employment, confidence in knowing that the jobs they do are worth while. They want to feel that their employer, the Government, is responsive to the particular needs of so many people who are making a great contribution to Australia's Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the report and the way in which it has been put together, I believe that it is interesting to note the priorities that have been given. I will read some of the chapter headings because they stand out and invite further discussion and debate. An entire chapter has been devoted to `The Extent and Magnitude of Wastage'. Another chapter is headed `The Effects of Wastage'. This chapter covers such matters as training deficiencies, the diversion of manpower and the loss of operational capacity of Australia's Defence Force. Another chapter is headed `Policy, Leadership and Morale'. What could be more important to any very significant group of people in Australia than to know that they are receiving leadership and morale encouragement either from politicians like us or the leadership of their own particular force discipline and area? What are the public perceptions of either the political leadership or the military leadership and how does that impact on morale? This question is well covered in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Another chapter is headed `Career Satisfaction and Personnel Management'. The Labor Government has said that it has made many innovative reforms in areas of the Public Service over the five years that it has been in office. Why has it neglected the defence forces area? Why is there a need for us to identify so many areas of personnel management that are either irrelevant in this day and age or do not apply to the job and the force to which they are directed? I am sure that my colleague Senator Newman will address a number of issues to do with what is generally called the service family. Unless a family can, firstly, survive and, secondly, know that it has worth and respect and a decent standard of living in the community, how can we expect servicemen to give in return the loyalty and commitment to their jobs that we would expect? That important area of service family has been continually neglected. I think `neglect' is probably the best word to describe how the Australian Labor Party has treated the service families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most important chapter of the whole report is that headed `Conditions of Service'. Most attention needs to be given to conditions of service which include pay and allowances, the pay fixing system, housing, retirement benefits and all of the other things that impact on a serviceman and on the quality of a force. How can we expect to retain service personnel if a service man or woman does not get a rate of pay which is comparable with that received in the broader community or in the defence forces internationally? That is probably the key area. When that is lacking they can have no confidence in the conditions of service that are available. Many other issues have been identified elsewhere in this report that provide the social triggers that force servicemen to resign. The cost of resignation is probably far greater than anything we could quantify or identify. The cost of someone leaving the Services can be measured in the cost to that person, to his family, to this Government and to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this report is timely. Each of the 48 recommendations must be addressed within the next few months by Mr Beazley and Mrs Kelly or the issue will compound throughout next year. While the people who will be affected by this report will be the current servicemen of Australia, I think it also important to note that a generation of young Australians currently aged between 13 and 18 years in the secondary schools of Australia are looking at their careers and their futures. A significant proportion of them ought to be able to know that they can enter the defence forces of Australia, get job satisfaction and career training and settle down to a very satisfactory life in the Services. They need to know that if they choose a career in the Services, the Government and the people of Australia will stand behind them and that they will get personal satisfaction from their careers. </PARA>
<PARA> This report has identified the problem areas. Unless the Government addresses those areas, I would hate this report to end up in the high school libraries of Australia. This report would create a very damning impression on the career choices of high school students who are looking for disciplined areas of high academic study that can be complemented by service in the defence forces, for trade careers which provide adequate training or for a family life that could give them brilliant satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the report is one of government. As I said, Minister Beazley and Minister Kelly have to look at sins of the past few years. They have to address these problems urgently. They have to make sure that every one of the issues in the 48 recommendations can be identified in the actions that they take and the ministerial responsibilities that they exercise in the next few months. We need to see in the Budget next year a real determination by the Government to correct this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the House of Representatives the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) told the Parliament that the problems which had been discussed in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that we are now discussing had bottomed out and that they had been all fixed largely as a result of the measures that she had taken. Last month in the House of Representatives the same Minister said that morale in the Navy, the Air Force and the Army was very high. Mrs Kelly has been trying to put across this line ever since she obtained the Defence Science and Personnel portfolio over a year ago. We all remember the clangers she made when she said that there really was not much of a problem, that there had been a small amount of distortion in terms of the number of women resigning, that there had been a problem with what she called the `Vietnam hump' and that we should really not worry about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She does suffer from grand delusions. That is also evidenced by the fact that when things were getting tough she put out an order requiring wives of defence personnel to submit their questions to her before she spoke to them. The orders went out that they were to mind their p's and q's and not embarrass the Minister. It is a sad day when civilians are treated like that in order to protect the Minister's sensitivities when quite clearly she either does not know her job or she is trying to con the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is more important to us to look at what the report said, not what the Minister says. It is the Minister who is in the hot seat, as is her colleague, the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I will selectively quote some rather damning items from the report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the lead time to replace a highly skilled and trained individual can be at least as long as that required to introduce into service an item of capital equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not just giving people rifles and sending them off around the parade ground any more. They have to be trained for a highly technologically advanced force. The report also said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the present level of wastage is substantially too high and has been for some time. </PARA>
<PARA>For 5 1/2 years we have watched that wastage grow. The report went on to talk about the balance of funding between capital equipment and personnel and training votes. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be a most dangerous practice to allow one key element of those capabilities to degrade past a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA>My complaint about the Ministry is that it has allowed that to happen. The Minister Mr Beazley is adamant that he will not change the proportion of capital equipment vote in his budget, and that is the source of so many of the problems that the personnel are facing. The report also said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . political and some military leadership is generally regarded as insensitive, disinterested and ineffectual . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The report documented cases where Mrs Kelly and Senator Walsh had made some of those insensitive statements. I could add many others to the list which has caused great burning resentment amongst members of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recorded its dissatisfaction with the time taken to implement the recommendations of the Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses. The report also said:</PARA>
<PARA> While we believe that the root cause of the high separation rate the Defence Force is experiencing essentially arises from disaffection with leadership and lack of career and/or job satisfaction, any coordinated strategy aimed at reducing separations is unlikely to succeed if it does not address the conditions of service anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA>One could go on and on. I must say, in passing, that `separations' is defence-speaking for quitting the service, usually in a huff. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of this report is that it draws the attention of senators and the nation as a whole to a matter which is crucial to the defence of Australia. It is vital that the message does not slip into oblivion like its predecessor, the Cross report on the management of Australia's defence. This Government has a poor track record when it comes to reports on defence. Apart from its dismissal of the report on the Department of Defence, it was almost a year before any substantial implementation of the long awaited Hamilton recommendation occurred. The hopes and expectations which are riding on the immediate implementation of that report made that year weigh very heavily with service families. Today many of Mrs Hamilton's recommendations, particularly those involving government spending, are still awaiting implementation: the really meaningful ones such as meaningful child care assistance; dealing with the problems of separated spouses; providing a system to assist spouses with employment as they move around the country; and providing a meaningful disturbance allowance for all these many occasions when they move the whole house and the family from one side of Australia to another. They are always out of pocket, and the disturbance allowance has not kept up with the times. The education allowance also does not help. Only 77 children in the whole of the Defence Force get the benefit of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also seems to be finding Mr Cooksey's report on the Review of Australia's Defence Cooperation Programs and Policy on Export of Defence Equipment a little difficult to handle. We just cannot allow history to be repeated with this report for it documents what I have been predicting and warning the Government about for many long months. Indeed, as you would recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, I talked about these matters when I first arrived in the Parliament 2 1/2 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of this report is that it demonstrates that the Government has failed. The Government has failed because the numbers leaving the services are still rising. Each year for the last four years these numbers have inexorably risen. The Government has failed because it will not put enough money into the personnel share of the Budget. It is now 43 per cent and that is far too low. When the Government took office, it was 50 per cent, and year by year it has dropped. The Government has failed because it has not shown the leadership needed to deal with the morale problems caused by the bloated defence bureaucracy. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel too, has failed. She has no influence in Cabinet, no financial authority, and she has spent her days in a public relations exercise devoted to trivia and to a disastrous operation known as the pilot retention bonus, while the real issues of complete review of pay and allowances, career development and management are ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing the greatest exodus from the forces in the history of the Defence Force. Since 1983, over 44,000 men and women have fled from the forces. This cannot be passed off as part of a natural cycle or turnover. Last financial year the forces recruited 8,483 staff, but lost 9,327. This is no Vietnam hump, as suggested by the Minister; this is the deliberate resignation of many frustrated and disillusioned men and women, as is demonstrated by the fact that 41 per cent of those quitting the forces last year were not eligible for pensions. These people could not even wait long enough to claim any benefits accruing from their years of service. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly made a submission to the Committee which has just reported, as I did myself. In her submission she stressed that the Defence Force has sustained its manpower in terms of its average strength due to successful recruiting. This simply reveals her ignorance or, alternatively, the bad advice she receives, since she fails to take into account the nature of the recruiting figures. All the recruiting in the world cannot replace the valuable knowledge, skill and experience, which comes from service of between six years and 16 years in most cases, that is being drained from the forces as those most experienced and valuable ranks leave. For example, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is 84 pilots short of its optimum operating level, 32.5 per cent short of airborne electrical analysts and 24 per cent of flight engineers have resigned, leaving the RAAF 12 short of the restricted manning level which has been forced upon them. The Navy is desperately short of electrical and communications engineers and radar plotters and the pension ineligible separation numbers-that is, the people leaving without a pension entitlement-as a whole fell by 282, but the officer component of this category registered an increase of 18.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Just why are these people leaving? They are leaving, as the report clearly demonstrates, because they are skilled professionals and this Government is treating them no better than navvies. The men and women of our Services and their families cannot, as this Government seems to believe, survive simply on patriotism and loyalty, although they have plenty of that. For the most part, they are not leaving because they do not like the job; they are leaving because the job simply is not viable in terms of pay, service conditions and career structure. It simply does not compare with what is available in other work sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to detail a number of specific problem areas and what I suggest we should do to correct them. When it comes to pay, the Government, having trained these men and women at an enormous cost these days, is foolishly only willing to pay them a fraction of what their skills are worth on the open market. This policy of penny wise and pound foolish means that the Government is providing the commercial sector with ready trained personnel at the expense of its own defence capability. British officers are earning an average of $10,500 more than their Australian counterparts, which must be the first time that that has occurred for at least 30 years; but worse, some of our lower ranks and trainees have to rely on welfare supplements to make ends meet. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgusting. Despite the long hours being worked by service members-and that is at least 52 1/2 hours a week in many cases-this Government has established a track record of delay in reviewing allowances and pay. In other sectors workers would not put up with it, their unions would be screaming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Committee report has emphasised that there is an immediate need to implement a system of automatic pay review by the Remuneration Tribunal without the intervention of the Government or the Department of Defence. The Government needs to provide urgently meaningful resources so that its Tribunal can get on and do the job which has been promised to the defence forces-that is, a biennial review of their pay and allowances. The Defence Force Advocate needs to be free to appeal without the Secretary of the Department breathing down his neck and the Secretary should be removed from any involvement in the process. These are recommendations with which I heartily agree. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme. Servicemen are obliged to pay 5.5 per cent of their income every year into this scheme, but unless they stay for 20 years they simply receive their contributions back with not a penny of interest after all that time. That is a fund where the Government gets the benefit, but it is not the way unions would expect their superannuation funds to be worked these days, and nor should our defence forces expect to suffer that indignity either. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the pay, the problems associated with the unique lifestyle of the Defence Force-for example, things like frequent postings-are proving to be major contributing factors to the wastage in the forces, as many of the exit surveys the Government has received have revealed. I do not intend to spend time on housing today, except to say that 60 per cent of the housing is substandard by the Department's own assessment. The Government has moved-I give it credit for this-to establish the Defence Housing Authority. Unfortunately, the nature of the beast is such that it will require more than $750m over 10 years to replace or upgrade 60 per cent of substandard housing which the forces are currently being required to live in and pay rent for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on Public Works of the Parliament did a wide survey of single personnel in the forces. The survey revealed that their accommodation was inadequate and noisy, which made it difficult for people to study, and there was no privacy and practically no storage for individuals. From my own inspection of single accommodation, that is quite true. The Committee has recommended the upgrading of this accommodation be speeded up, that covered carports be provided for single personnel and that until such time as adequate accommodation is provided, the living out allowance should be made more flexible so that servicemen can go and get their own accommodation outside the forces if they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a humane recommendation which I would have expected the Government to put into operation long before this. Professional people are living in welfare-standard housing or worse in some of the most undesirable areas in Australia. I get the most pathetic letters from servicemen saying, `I am not going to stay in this area any longer, with my family being stood over by drug pushers and standover people, with petty vandalism and minor theft'. Some suburban areas where defence people are now posted have some of the greatest social problems that we face in this country. That is not good enough for people who have pledged to defend the standards of this country. I would have expected that they would be entitled to the standards that they are pledged to defend. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a great deal from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel about her efforts in the education area. I welcome the fact that she has recognised that it is a problem. Unfortunately, the publicity campaign does not quite match the reality. The reality is that the tuition allowance that she talks about has actually produced coaching for 27 children. We have 30,000 married servicemen in the forces: 27 children are in receipt of tuition allowance. An education allowance was already in existence, and Mrs Kelly tells us that she has seen to it that the criteria for that allowance have been freed up. They have certainly been freed up; they are almost incomprehensible. The number of children now benefiting from the education allowance, which enables them to stay in a State if there is disruption to their education, has risen from 55 to 77. I hardly think that that is a matter for a national publicity campaign. If Mrs Kelly was really serious about it she would see to it that that education allowance was available to any secondary school child of service personnel whose parents were facing a move. That would really be something to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government continually berates employers for the need to provide employer based child-care. I remember Senator Devereux in Tasmania not long ago representing the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) and telling employers how much more productive their work force would be and how much higher the morale of their work force would be if child-care were provided by the employer. Charity begins at home. If Senator Devereux really believes what he says, he should be working very hard on his Ministry because it is certainly not prepared to do that with its own employees. I am talking about young men and women, young mothers who are thousands of miles away from their own mothers or sisters, with no back-up family support, being asked to live in all sorts of odd and difficult places. They are going into areas where their children are on the bottom of the queue for child-care and do not reach the top until they leave the area. The Minister has to do something urgently about this. Mrs Hamilton two years ago urged that that be done. The Minister is still conducting a study. It is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation of the Hamilton report related to spouse employment. Typically in Australia today families are finding that with the reduced standards of living this Government has imposed upon them they need two incomes coming in. Members of the defence forces are no different. They desperately need that second income. It is much more difficult for them because they are constantly moving. It is very hard for wives to find employment, especially if they are known as service wives who will be here today and gone tomorrow. Mrs Hamilton recommended that an assistance scheme be set up to find employment for spouses of Defence Force personnel and to give priority to them in defence employment. The Committee has again recommended that but the Government has had two years since Mrs Hamilton made that recommendation to put it into operation and it still has not happened. Mrs Kelly has nothing to skite about. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's Defence Force members have had the benefit of extensive education and stringent selection procedures. They therefore possess specialist skills which should be valued and paid for. They are entitled to expect a sound career structure, presenting opportunities for responsibility, promotion and performance. They are also entitled to expect some consultation on issues and decisions which affect their lives and the lives of their families. But this is not what they get. As the report makes very clear, there is clearly a leadership problem within the Department. A lot of this is probably due to a lack of authority, in that many service issues lie outside the services' control or influence. The civilians in the departments of Defence, Industrial Relations and Finance rule the roost. It is therefore essential that the Government act on the recommendation to deal with the powerful position of some of the civilians in the conditions of service area. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly draw attention to the service allowance fiasco, where the failure of the Chief of the Defence Force to appeal against a decision which was clearly not in the interests of servicemen had a disastrous effect upon morale and there has been some disillusionment with senior leadership. That is very sad to see and it has to be addressed. The report on the Defence Department, which I mentioned earlier in my speech, had major implications not only for the efficiency of the Department but also for the morale of those who are sent there to work and who see a large and frustrating road ahead. Other sectors of the work force would never stand for such conditions and would inevitably strike. But our Defence Force personnel cannot take that way out and instead they are leaving the forces en masse. Either way, it has the same effect-and so emasculates our defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government, or at least this Defence Minister, does not seem to be able to grasp is that big guns, impressive planes and sophisticated ships cannot defend this country. It is the well trained and experienced people who operate them that we depend upon. It is they who defend this country. With the Government's present spending priorities-29.1 per cent on equipment, 27.9 per cent on operations, and 43 per cent on personnel-and the enormous $8,567m outstanding financial commitment it has ahead of it for equipment, we are rapidly approaching a situation where we will be left with extremely sophisticated and technologically advanced equipment suitable for medium to high level conflicts but without the trained personnel to use it. We have a number of examples where equipment is already undermanned or undermaintained, and in some cases mothballed. I shall not go into the details of that now for pressure of time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an increasingly greater proportion of the forces in training-just over 11 per cent at 30 June 1988-and that leads to a dilution of experience and expertise. As the report so clearly states, it leads to enormous cost. Money that could be spent elsewhere keeping these people in is being used to train new people to replace them. This situation is even more alarming and the Government's priorities even more awry when one considers that our most likely threat is a low level one, and very labour intensive in terms of patrol surveillance and high mobility. What if the Indonesian fishing boats had been full of armed men? We would have had real problems in this country. As Brigadier Alan Hodges, Western Australia's most senior soldier, said in the West Australian on 8 March this year:</PARA>
<PARA> Small forces of men could come ashore undetected, well kitted and well armed. They could do a lot of damage. </PARA>
<PARA>If one visits, as I have, the Northern bases of Australia, such as Darwin or Tindal, it is clear what a mess we would be in if groups of commandos set out to damage several of our northern bases at once. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Des Ball, the defence analyst at the Australian National University Centre for Strategic and Defence Studies, has said that the effective defence of Australia's northern bases would require nine battalions. At the present time Australia has only six battalions. Yet despite such opinions, the Minister continues to accumulate capital equipment while our personnel suffer. Given the vulnerability of Australia's terrain, the location of its strategic bases and vital national areas, and the number of people required to defend it, this is a dangerous path. Emphasis in government spending must shift away from total attention on equipment to a balanced attention on personnel and operations. A shift of only one to two per cent from capital equipment would deal with the problems of manning levels and the personnel wastage that we are now facing. Mrs Kelly, in her submission to the inquiry, stressed the importance of the Committee's findings. I think this is a very relevant point and we should think about it very seriously. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>The sifting of fact and fiction that your committee is engaged in in this inquiry should go a long way towards making this debate more rational. In that way it will be an invaluable contribution to the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Kelly's submission was dated August this year. She seems to have suddenly changed her mind when she found that she, her fellow Minister and her Government had been put in the hot seat by a bipartisan parliamentary committee. She set the parameters within which these matters should be considered, and she has in fact accepted in advance her own shortcomings and those of the Defence Minister and the Government as a whole. But, to give her her due, I think she has been trying, although with very little success. It is time for the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, to take off his blinkers and face up to the reality. What is needed is an honest appraisal, a commitment and the courage to change direction. Words will not upgrade living standards or allowances, and promises will not improve management techniques. They need to be accompanied by financial commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> This report of the Committee gives the Government a blueprint on which to base its future conduct. But it has no time to spare. It has been warned now for several years that its neglect would prove disastrous. It is now five minutes to midnight for the defence forces. Nothing less than an immediate and total commitment will reverse the process of deterioration and emasculation within the forces, and nothing less will preserve the capable and credible defence of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the Senate this evening to speak strongly in favour of a Bill-the Census and Statistics Amendment (Voluntary Provision of Survey Information) Bill-introduced by Senator Glen Sheil, which relates to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and its most incredible household expenditure survey. The Implications of this Bill are not solely about the household expenditure survey, although that is the current issue; more importantly, the Bill which Senator Sheil has introduced seeks to protect the privacy of every individual Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now privacy can mean many things to many people. The Macquarie Dictionary defines privacy as `the state of being private; retirement or seclusion'. I believe that privacy means the right which every Australian has to live his or her life without being threatened, to be able to keep his or her intimate family and financial matters amongst themselves and to be undisturbed. Contrasting this, we have the household expenditure survey, a survey which has been the method by which the Australian Bureau of Statistics has sought to extract those intimate details from ordinary Australians. By its action, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is becoming the Big Brother of Australian Bureaucracy, and its officers may soon find themselves in a position where they are nothing more than peeping toms spying through household keyholes and through windows where curtains have not been drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 7,500 households have been targeted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for this survey. It is not a minor survey; indeed, it contains a 22-page income and a 110-page expenditure questionnaire. It also contains a two-week spending diary plus a form authorising the Bureau to extract loan details from those unlucky persons' banks. Now, depending on the circumstances and the amount of financial transactions which the family may have, they may be required to answer anything from 300 to 1,100 questions. It is right and proper that the people of Australia should be outraged by this survey. It is also right and proper that we, as their elected representatives, should seek to do something about it. I am very pleased that Senator Sheil has brought this Bill forward to do something. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take up too much of the Senate's time on individual cases, but I would point out that my office has received numerous complaints about the survey, and that has been going on for quite some time. They are complaints which are coming from a broad spectrum of social groups all of whom are considerably outraged by its consequences. I have had people threatening violence over the survey. No doubt those people who have been distributing the questionnaires could attest to similar threats. But, more importantly, I have also had elderly pensioners with a few hundred dollars in the bank who have been reduced to tears over this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What I question is this: is it the Australian Bureau of Statistics which is at fault, or is it the Government which has chosen to allow this matter to progress without following the proper procedures? I refer to the failure of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to table this document. Section 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the Bureau shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament before its implementation, unless the proposal is for the collection of information on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Bureau of Statistics contends that, because this household expenditure survey is a repeat of the 1984 household expenditure survey, it did not need to table the new details. But anyone who has had even the briefest look at the two surveys can tell quite clearly that they are very different. There was, therefore, a requirement that this new survey, which contains a number of new and more prying questions, should have been tabled to make it legal, and this is a view which has been supported by a number of very eminent individuals. I would like to quote some of them. The first most of us would be aware of is by Peter O'Keeffe, Clerk-Assistant (Procedure) from the Senate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is, however, strongly arguable that, since the proposal for the 1984 HES was not a proposal for a regular, annual, survey, the 1988 Survey in fact and in law relates to a ``new proposal'' which should have been tabled in Parliament. If this argument is valid the failure of the ABS to table a new proposal has the effect, under subsection 6 (3) of the ABSA, of rendering the current survey a voluntary one only. No new proposal can be ``implemented'' by the Bureau until it has been tabled, unless participation in the survey is to be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> I am inclined to the view that the current survey is in fact and in law a new survey for which there has been no tabled proposal. There was no indication in the proposal tabled in 1988 that it related to any HES survey other than that to be conducted in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>This was backed up by Robert K. O'Connor, a barrister from Cathedral Square in Perth, Western Australia, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Opinion expressed by Mr O'Keeffe on both questions. </PARA>
<PARA>He quoted six reasons and went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the inescapable conclusion is that the 1988-89 survey is a ``new proposal''. It is of a similar type or kind to the earlier proposal, but it itself is nevertheless a new proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Bureau of Statistics' own advice to itself, if you like, was that the survey should have been tabled. I would like to quote from an Australian Bureau of Statistics' minute paper, which says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Household Expenditure Survey is the most burdensome household survey undertaken by the ABS and is also considered to be highly intrusive by some members of the community. As a consequence, the survey tends to generate Ministerials arising from complaints by constituents to their Local Members of Parliament. Being able to say that the survey had been tabled and subject to parliamentary scrutiny then becomes a very useful ABS tactic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take up a short time in the Senate this evening to outline that earlier this year a constituent brought to my attention the fact that on the 1988 Form S Tax Guide toll free numbers were listed for Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart. Thus, residents outside those centres who wanted to make contact with the Australian Taxation Office in their capital city could telephone that office for the cost of a local call. No such toll free number was provided for Brisbane. My constituent, who lives on the Gold Coast, quite properly asked why he was obliged to use STD facilities while those in other States could use a toll free number. I could not answer this person's valid question, so I placed a question on notice to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The question was in four parts. Part one read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Did the 1988 Form S Tax Guide have Taxation Office telephone contacts on the rear page?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question was yes. Part two of my question read:</PARA>
<PARA>If so, were toll free numbers provided for Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question was yes. Part three of my question read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Was a toll free number listed for Brisbane or were inquirers from outside the Brisbane area directed to telephone a Brisbane telephone number using STD. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question was:</PARA>
<PARA>A toll free number was not listed for Brisbane. Enquiries from outside the Brisbane area were required to use an STD number. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I take issue with the answer to my question No. 4. Question No. 4 read:</PARA>
<PARA>If Brisbane was the only capital city for which non-metropolitan residents were not directed to use a toll free number, why was that so. </PARA>
<PARA>In part the answer read:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) recognises the value and importance of providing a toll-free inquiry service for non-metropolitan residents. A detailed study of toll-free telephone requirements was undertaken in late 1987 for the purpose of identifying deficiencies in the provision of the service and to provide a basis for allocating funds for remedial action. At that time a number of Branch Offices already had toll-free telephones in use but others, including the Brisbane Office, did not. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a little more to that answer, but it is not relevant to the question I asked. Indeed, what I have read out of the answer to question four was not relevant to the question I asked anyway. It is perhaps written in a bureaucratic language that someone understands, but certainly I do not. It did not answer the question that I asked. If five capital cities were able to have toll free numbers, why could not Brisbane? That was the question, but it was not answered. Whoever cleared the question was acting in a cavalier way to a perfectly reasonable question. There is no point in my pursuing the matter further, unless the Treasurer considers that it is worth asking his Department to respond properly. What I will say, however, is that residents near Brisbane expect the same facilities as taxpayers in other States. If they do not, in future I shall ask why. I shall not accept a non-answer again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today Senator Vanstone referred a matter to the President, on which he has just made a statement, relating to the refusal of the Senate printing unit to publish attachments to a press release because those attachments contained depictions of explicit sex, which they do. I have the press release with the attachments in my possession, as I regret to say perhaps so do a lot of others. The Senate debated the subject of explicit sex material yesterday, and the senator who led the debate for the Opposition thundered about the Government's hypocrisy in wanting to delay the question of banning totally X-rated-that is non-violent explicit-erotica. In that debate the hypocrisy of Senator Hill was exposed very quickly indeed by Senator Crowley--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exposed very quickly by Senator Crowley when she read an extract from a speech that Senator Hill himself had delivered on 15 October this year. It was not dug out of the Hansard of four, five or 10 years ago. It was delivered here in Canberra at a public seminar on sexism in advertising. Senator Hill led a debate in this chamber yesterday condemning the Government for not agreeing at this time to ban non-violent, non-coercive explicit erotica. On 15 October at a public seminar Senator Hill said-and, I am told by many people who were there, said very vociferously indeed-that he would not agree to regulation of advertising on television-even if, presumably, it were sexist or offensive-because, to quote Senator Hill, he was totally opposed to censorship. However, we know that scarcely two or three weeks later Senator Hill led a debate in this chamber. If at any stage honourable senators in this chamber are a little concerned that they may be verging close to committing the crime of hypocrisy, then before they condemn themselves they should compare whatever they intend to do with the performance of Senator Hill-a performance that one would have to describe as a benchmark in that area, breathtaking indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had another performance today from Senator Vanstone, which I condemn utterly-and I shall be very surprised if Senator Harradine does not condemn it when he hears the facts, particularly if he looks at the extraordinary press release with its even more extraordinary attachment distributed by Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone has in fact broken the law in a serious fashion indeed. If the same breach of law had been committed by the retailers whom Senator Vanstone thunders against, they would be subjected to very serious penalties indeed, including heavy fines and imprisonment. Senator Vanstone herself as an individual is also liable for penalties, including heavy fines and/ or imprisonment-and so she should be. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I would like to refer to the guidelines for the elimination of sexual harassment in the workplace because, unfortunately, as well as committing a serious offence against the Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 of the Australian Capital Territory, Senator Vanstone has directly breached the guidelines for the elimination of sexual harassment in the workplace and has exposed herself, I think-I hope it is not unparliamentary to say so-as a fool. Before she raised the matter with the President today she should have read page 1 of the very guidelines she referred to. Of course, Senator Vanstone was trying to make a point, a very silly point, that because the woman who was in charge of the print office found the material offensive-as was her right to find it-she refused to publish it. Senator Vanstone obviously is trying to make the point that that constituted a proven case that this material of itself was offensive, and in fact, qualified to be classed as sexual harassment in the workplace. Of course, Senator Vanstone did not bother reading the guidelines. They are very sensible, sane and reasonable guidelines. Senator Vanstone simply breached them in an offensive way-in a way I would have been offended about if I had been in charge of the print shop. I will read the guidelines because they are very sensible indeed. They state:</PARA>
<PARA> Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination and as such should not be condoned or tolerated in the workplace--</PARA>
<PARA>hear, hear!-</PARA>
<PARA> It includes a wide range of behaviour of a sexual nature which causes another person distress-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the key point-</PARA>
<PARA>for such behaviour to constitute sexual harassment it must be unwanted, unsolicited and unreciprocated. </PARA>
<PARA>The woman in charge of the print shop did not want the explicit sexual material that Senator Vanstone seems to be so besotted with. She did not solicit it. The guidelines for sexual harassment were certainly breached, and breached by Senator Vanstone herself in the most outrageous and offensive way.</PARA>
<PARA> There is another far more serious problem in regard to what Senator Vanstone did. I am not making political points. This is not rhetoric. I am extremely angry indeed in regard to Senator Vanstone's impossible, disgraceful actions today in issuing this stuff. Unfortunately, press releases from politicians are not restricted publications; they are spread, as this one has been spread, widely everywhere. They are freely available to any- body. No retailer of explicit sex in Canberra is permitted--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all over the place. Senator Vanstone issued the press release. She obviously photocopied the material and attached it. I have certainly seen that material all over the place today. I would strongly advise Senator Vanstone in her own interests to stop publishing it and to withdraw those copies of the press release which she can get her hands on. Senator Vanstone in fact has committed a serious offence-an offence I personally condemn-in attaching scenes of explicit sex to a press release. These are scenes which are not legally available to anyone under the age of 18 years in the Australian Capital Territory, or anywhere else. They have been attached to a press release which is freely available. That is contemptible behaviour. The best that could be said about it is that it is irresponsible. However, it is also criminal behaviour. I would like to refer to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983. Section 47 of that Ordinance states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>47 (1) A person who advertises, or sells or otherwise publishes-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone published this material-</PARA>
<PARA>a publication, being</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Category 1 or a Category 2 restricted publication; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a film classified as an `R' film or an `X' film,</PARA>
<PARA>otherwise than in accordance with the conditions applicable to that publication, is guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>The publication by Senator Vanstone of this explicit material which is not otherwise available in the ACT, unless it is on restricted premises that can be entered only by a person 18 years of age or over, involves, in the case of a body corporate:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a fine not exceeding $2,500; and,</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the case of an individual-by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months, or both. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone also has breached the second sub-section in this section of the Ordinance. Section 47 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA>A person who deposits, or causes to be deposited-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Category 1 or Category 2 restricted publication; or</PARA>
<PARA>as Senator Vanstone has-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a film classified as an `R' film or an `X' film, in or on a public place-</PARA>
<PARA>which this Parliament House is-</PARA>
<PARA> except with the permission of the occupier-</PARA>
<PARA>I am an occupier and I did not give her my permission. I am sure the President did not. In fact, the President through his print office presumably refused permission. The Ordinance continued;</PARA>
<PARA> . . . ia guilty of an offence punishable, on conviction-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in the cae of a body corporate-by a fine not exceeding $5,000; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the case of an individual-</PARA>
<PARA>the individual being Senator Vanstone-</PARA>
<PARA>by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months, or both. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that Senator Vanstone has breached two sections of the Publications Ordinance which would give her a maximum cumulative sentence of $5,500 and/or nine months in prison. It might be a great relief to all of us in here if the second part of the penalty were applied to Senator Vanstone. I do not think she should be prosecuted. The reason I do not think she should be prosecuted is that I think it would give her more publicity, frankly, than she is worth. I might say, having gone through this publication, that she has probably breached-I have had only 10 minutes in which to look at it-a number of other sections of this Ordinance as well. In fact, she has in my view, certainly on the face of it, been guilty of a serious offence. She has certainly been guilty of committing an offence which, if it were committed by a retailer of explicit sex material-the sort of person she rails against-would be punishable indeed by very serious penalties of both imprisonment and fines. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say again, I am not in here to prosecute Senator Vanstone, although I think she probably deserves it. I am here to condemn her as an individual and as a senator for attaching explicit sexual material to a public press release, which is not restricted, containing material which, in the ACT where she published it, would be behind locked doors with big signs saying that one has to be 18 years or over to go in and look at it. I might add that the retailers of explicit sexual material are not permitted to advertise that material by publishing any of the depictions that the press release contains-as Senator Vanstone is well aware. She should be ashamed of herself at the very least. Politicians' press releases, certainly my press releases, have found their way into school libraries. I know of a number of schools in the Northern Territory which regularly collect public statements by political figures in the Northern Territory. I am referring to high schools that are full of children under the age of 18 years. Frankly, I think this is contemptible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it is incumbent on any senator in this House, if such a senator is concerned about children seeing or reading this material, to raise it to the attention of the House. I said in the debate yesterday that my major concern-the concern that I expressed all through the hearings of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material-was the potential access of children to this material. I should have thought that that was a sentiment that would be shared by every senator in this chamber. For the sake of scoring a few rather cheap political points, for the sake of missing the mark completely, as she did in terms of the sexual harassment guidelines when in fact she is the one who committed the breach of them in forcing material which was entirely unwanted and unsolicited on a woman in the print room-that act in itself is contempt- ible-Senator Vanstone has taken actions today which no retailer, that I am aware of, of any explicit sexual material in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory would have taken, in attaching to a public press release of hers photocopied pictures of explicit sex scenes from X-rated movies. I am prepared to give the honourable senator the benefit of the doubt in this matter. I think she has committed a gross error of judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My position on explicit sexual material is very simple. There should be a category of non-violent erotica (NVE). That is hardly a secret. Anyone who has taken the trouble to read the Joint Select Committee's report-and I regret to say that many people who have been following this debate have not bothered to do that-will see my position stated there very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I was the first person to raise in the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory my concern that X-rated material was freely available; it was being retailed in supermarkets and service stations in the Northern Territory and was causing considerable concern and disquiet in the community. I raised the matter as the then Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory. I am pleased to say that, with the total cooperation of the then Chief Minister, Mr Ian Tuxworth, legislation-the first of its kind-was introduced into the Northern Territory Parliament which treated R-rated and X-rated category material in precisely the same way, and put it behind locked doors. The position was logical and reasonable. That is, if the law says that a person cannot have access to X-rated material if he or she is not 18 years of age or over, and if the law says that a person cannot have access to R-rated material unless he or she is 18 years of age or over, they both should be treated in the same way and at least we should do something positive instead of simply paying lip-service to the violent and sexually violent material available in the R-rated category. That is what we did in the Northern Territory. The system has been operating for 12 months, and I can say with absolute certainty that it has eased the disquiet that many people had because of their concern that this material would fall into the hands of minors-precisely, I might add, by her actions today, where Senator Vanstone has potentially placed it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not seen too much redeeming material in the X-rated category. I have seen some of it which was satirical and which I thought was very clever and funny-satirising, I might add, the censors and censorship. I have seen some of it that could be described fairly as material of very high quality and constituting artistic merit of great degree. But the majority of the material is trash. The majority of it is boring, and I dislike most of it. The problem is that I dislike censorship, particularly the censors-the self-appointed ones-even more, and that is the balance one has to strike. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that Senator Hill in the debate yesterday totally contradicted a thundering public statement that he had made in this city only three weeks before when he said he opposed censorship and would not even agree to regulating offensive advertising. Certainly Senator Vanstone's behaviour today has convinced me once again that if I had any lingering political doubts about the rightness of the position I am taking, I am certainly on the side of the angels in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of Senator Vanstone to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 and to the fact that the retailers of the material which she continually brings into this House-she seems to have a fascination with Bill's Big Banana, because she has brought the actual video into the chamber at Question Time on a number of occasions and flashed it from the front--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I withdraw any reflections that I made on the senator. I simply state as a matter of fact-I was interested to see it-that part of the explicit sexual material depicted in the attachments to Senator Vanstone's press release contained once again scenes from the movie that she has actually physically brought into this Chamber on previous occasions. I am simply saying that I did not solicit that material to be brought in here; I did not want it; and I would rather Senator Vanstone did not bring it in here again, because it offends me and I do not like it. If I want to watch it, I will go to the premises where it is legally available and watch it there, or I will hire it and take it to my own home and watch it, or I will watch it because Parliament tells me that I should watch it as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, carrying out a function which I think probably has not corrupted me all that much, by viewing that material. But I do not particularly want it brought into this chamber, where there are public galleries full of school children at Question Time-when Senator Vanstone brought the video in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I call your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President, to what I did on both occasions that I have spoken on X-rated material. On both occasions I prefaced my remarks by warning people-and I was particularly cognisant of the children-both in this new Parliament House and the old Parliament House, that I was going to discuss, as I had to, this material. I gave them and the people who were looking after them the opportunity to take the children out of the Parliament. That was not any grandstanding move on my part. It was done because of a genuine belief I have that I do not particularly like discussing this material in front of young children. However, one would hardly suggest that matters as serious as this should not be discussed in a parliament of adults. Of course not; we all discuss them. But I gave fair warning that I was going to do so, and I just wish that Senator Vanstone would stop doing what she has done. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone would probably accuse me of having standards that have slipped. Perhaps they have. Perhaps I have fallen a little from grace, and perhaps the reason that I have done so is that I was a regular watcher-in fact I tuned in again-and perhaps even dependent on the moral advice and strictures of the Reverend Jimmy Swaggart. We get Jim in the Northern Territory at 7 o'clock every Sunday morning. When Jim was not available I used to listen to Jimmy Bakker for my moral guidance. </PARA>

I tuned in to Jimmy Swaggart's program last Sunday at 7 a.m., because it is still being broadcast in the Northern Territory. I watched that good ol' boy storming up and down the platform with his Bible, thundering at the congregation, as so many self-appointed moralists and guardians of the public morals do, about the sins of the flesh. He was telling me-because I felt it was directed at me-that if I did not pull my socks up and become as morally astringent as Jimmy Swaggart, a big lightning bolt with my name on it would come down out of the skies and zap me clean off the earth. The trouble is, though, that I had to turn if off after five minutes-I usually manage to watch him for about 15 minutes-because I saw Jimmy, and I could not get it out of my head after the TV show was over, the lights were turned off, the plug was pulled out of the organ, the congregation gone and the choir sent home, having a quick dab around his eyes with a kleenex, sprinting up the aisle, grabbing a handful of $100 bills out of the nearest plastic bucket and off to the nearest motel with a prostitute and a Polaroid camera.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senators have printing services available to them. I suppose that if there were a problem that was it. Quite rightly, the Senate Printing Unit took offence at this material and refused to print it. That is a reflection on the material itself as much as on the perhaps not so wise decision to send it to the Printing Unit. I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the other 95 per cent which was utter humbug. Is Senator Collins threatening Senator Vanstone? Is he trying to shut up Senator Vanstone or other people from revealing to responsible people the nature, intent and content of this material? That is what we are talking about. Or is he reflecting upon the whole of the Press Gallery, suggesting that it in some way is not responsible and should not know what is in this material? That is what Senator Collins has been about all the time. That is what Senator Zakharov has been about all the time. That is what Dr Dick Klugman has been about. Let me prove it. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to look at the majority report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I ask them to look at the chapter dealing with the current Commonwealth laws on video material. I ask them to look at chapter 5 of the majority report. The majority report-that is, the Klugman, Zakharov, Collins, Jenkins and Jakobsen report-is chapter 5 as well. I ask honourable senator to look at section 5.32, which is the same in both reports. It deals with what it contained in the X classification. In our chapter 5 of the majority report it says what Dick Klugman has been going around saying and what the Film Censorship Board says. It is a bland statement as to what is concerned in X-rated material. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but does not include any depiction suggestion coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what it says in the majority report. Chapter 5.33 says:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus the subject matter drawing an X classification in December 1984 can include what was spelled out in the May 1984 guidelines-i.e. explicit penetration, masturbation, ejaculation, fellatio, cunnilingus, insertion of objects into orifices, miscellaneous other sexual activities and fetishes. </PARA>
<PARA>Is chapter 5.33 in the minority report? Of course it is not in the minority report because members of the Committee wanted to censor the facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with relish in a moment. I thank the honourable senator for reminding me. That is precisely what those members of the Committee did in its minority report. They attempted to censor what this material contained. They attempted to hide from the Parliament what this material actually contains. So we have in the public debate precisely that sort of censorship being conducted. Senator Collins was also a signatory to the minority report which misstated the legal position prior to 1984. We discussed this at length in the Committee proceedings. I do not think I am out of order by suggesting that we discussed this at length. Senator Collins included a statement in the report with which he was associated. It talked about the law prior to 1984 not covering videos. In fact, the law prior to 1984 did cover videos. This shows his ignorance and the ignorance of the other members of the minority of the actual law. Today we have had another example of the ignorance of Senator Collins of the actual law. Senator Collins referred to the possibility of Senator Vanstone breaching section 47 (2) (b) of the Classification of Publications Ordinance. I would hope that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) might listen to this because section 47 (2) (b) says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A person who deposits, or causes to be deposited-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Category 1 or a Category 2 restricted publication-</PARA>
<PARA>which this is not-</PARA>
<PARA>or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a film classified as a ``R'' film or an ``X'' film. </PARA>
<PARA>She did not deposit an R or an X film. Therefore, I cannot see how she would be liable under that provision. He said that she would be liable under 47 (1). Section 47 (1) says:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who advertises, or sells or otherwise publishes a publication . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What we have to do is look at the definition of the word `publication'. Publication is very broad and would normally include this material. However, the section goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>being-</PARA>
<PARA> a Category 1 or a Category 2 . . . or</PARA>
<PARA> a film classified as an `R' film or an `X' film,</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone did neither, unless her proposed action could be regarded as advertising. I am not too certain of that. Another section which I thought Senator Collins would have mentioned but did not was 48 (3) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> A person shall not publish any approved advertising matter in relation to a film except in accordance with the conditions (if any) to which the approval is subject. </PARA>
<PARA>That may apply: I do not know, because I am not sure of the conditions upon which this X-rated video received its X classification. I guarantee that nobody in this chamber would be sure of that either. The supporters of the Government's decision, which in effect rejected the unanimous request of the States to ban X-rated videos, are trying to censor information about what is contained in X-rated videos. Presumably, what Senator Vanstone was seeking to do-this is an argument that no doubt would be advanced by her-was to illuminate persons in a responsible position as to the nature of this material. </PARA>
<PARA> I now show the statements relating to this video to the Minister because I intend to seek leave to incorporate them in Hansard. I do so because I think it is important for members of the Parliament at least to know the nature of these videos. As Senator Collins said, it is important that we in this chamber know what we are talking about. If I am to be accused of doing something that is inappropriate, I do not think that it is inappropriate for members of this chamber to know the nature and content of X-rated videos. I believe that it is important for them to see whether they agree that this material falls within a category of erotica. However, I do not expect the Government to agree to my incorporating the statements until it has seen them. We have been faced with an attempt by Senator Collins and others associated with the minority of the Video Material Committee to censor information which ought to be known by responsible decision makers about the nature, content and intent of X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins went on to say what he has been saying all along about violence-that is, people are being soft on violence. I again refer the Senate to the fact that the Joint Select Committee on Video Material recommended that films of relished violence be refused classification and banned. He said that people pay lip service to the problem of violence. What did he, Senator Jenkins, Senator Zakharov, Dr Klugman and Ms Jakobsen do about that? They did not place it in their recommendations. Yet we, the majority, were saying that films of relished violence should be banned. We are certainly not soft on violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided on Tuesday to establish a committee. The committee that is to be established will do two things: it will, firstly, note the public confusion about what is contained in X and R and, secondly, seek to institute a public education campaign to show the difference between X and R. I am trying to visualise Senator Tate running around the countryside with an R in one hand and an X in the other. But I cannot really imagine him running around the countryside with an R film in one hand and an X film in the other and showing people the difference, saying, `This one does not contain violence but it contains anal sex, group sex and the like, and this one contains violence'. What a lot of hooey. What will the committee do? What powers will it have?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Government is seven months too late because the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material recommended that the Film Censorship Board tighten up guidelines in the M and R classifications to the extent, as was said yesterday, that the top half of R ought to be banned and the top half of M ought to go into R. All the State Ministers, meeting on 30 June this year, instructed the Film Censorship Board and the Films Board of Review to undertake that task. What is the Caucus committee going to do? It has no power. The Film Censorship Board and the Films Board of Review do. The States knew that and they told them to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> Tuesday's decision was a sham. It was an attempt to camouflage the fact that the Federal Government is continuing its legislative support for the hard core pornographic industry, against the express wishes of all the States and the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. The Commonwealth Government cannot say that the State Ministers did not know or were confused about what was in X-rated videos. They knew what was in this material, they knew the harm it could cause and they asked the Federal Government to ban it. </PARA>
<PARA>All members of the Committee saw the evidence. The majority of the Committee was persuaded by the evidence which was submitted to us by behavioural scientists and others that this material engenders in the mind of the habitual viewer a sexually calloused and manipulative attitude towards women. Anyone who studies X-rated videos will appreciate and understand that. This evidence was given to us by experts and others. We were also told that it engenders in the minds of regular viewers a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available. Four of the behavioural science research papers that were presented to us-namely those of Professor Bryant, Professor Jennings, Professor Check and Professor Weaver-said that the type of material contained in Australian X-rated video material is more harmful in this regard than even violent pornography which is already banned in Australia. That is something which the Government must have regard to. Obviously the States have because they have made the request. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins seems to be taking the running on this matter. He is going around the countryside saying that he went onto the Committee with a view that this material ought to be banned and that he came out of it saying that it ought not to be banned. As I said yesterday, the same Bob Collins, as a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, spoke in favour of and voted for the sale and hire of X-rated videos in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that some impropriety has taken place. As I say, I would not have sent the material down to the Senate Printing Unit. I do not blame the persons down there for taking the attitude that they did. I think that they are quite courageous. Nevertheless, we should not obscure the fact that the video industry and those who support it are trying to censor information about the nature, intent and content of the material in an effort to ensure that responsible decision makers do not know what is happening. That is a disgrace. Obviously the Caucus decision was based on false and censored information. The consequences of that deplorable decision will be visited upon individual members of Caucus in the electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last couple of days the Parliament has been discussing a very important issue, namely the availability of X-rated videos in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and, through mail order, to the rest of Australia. Some honourable senators will know that I did not speak in the debate yesterday. My view on this material is perfectly clear. I made it clear some six months ago when I asked the Minister for Local Government, Senator Reynolds, a question pertaining to the Government's desire to advance and protect the status of women. The import of my question was that if the Government had a very strong desire, or even a mild desire, to protect the status of women, these sorts of trashy, offensive videos would be banned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not a lot has happened since then. The Minister's reply indicated that the State Attorneys-General were meeting some four of six weeks from the time that I asked the question, that they would express their view then as to what they wanted done and then the Commonwealth would decide. This brings us up to yesterday when the Commonwealth did decide that it is not going to take any notice of what the State Attorneys-General had decided; that X-rated videos, this trashy, offensive material, will continue to be available in the ACT. I accept that these videos are not freely available; I understand the limitations put on the availability of this material. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the material is offensive. I agree with the line of argument put forward by Senator Harradine. I do not know about other senators, but I do not make a habit of watching X-rated videos. I actually sought some X-rated videos to get some understanding of what everyone was complaining about. I found the cover of the two videos that my staff hired for a day or so so offensive that I decided not to bother looking at the contents. That satisfied me that the people making assessments about what goes into X-rated videos are not doing so in accordance with the views of the public. Many members of the public will say `yes' when asked if they think someone should be able to look at non-violent erotica. If one then describes to them some of the material that is depicted on the cover of a video provided by Senator Harradine, they would say no, they do not think that sort of material should be available. There is an ambiguity in the term `non-violent erotica'. It is a broad and general term. The availability of video 355 indicates the sort of trashy and offensive material that is available under the X classification. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought on a number of occasions to raise this matter and to acquaint honourable senators who do not make a habit of looking at X-rated videos and seeing what is available, with just exactly what is available. Mr Acting Deputy President, it is no surprise to me that that material is unsuitable to be written or read into Hansard. I would be horrified to think that someone would object to your ruling in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to Senator Collins. Senator Collins perhaps-I do not know-likes the sound of his own voice. When I asked him for the courtesy of giving me some indication of for how long he wished to speak, he indicated about 10 minutes. I note that he took the full 30 minutes. So perhaps he became engrossed with what he was saying and he enjoys the sound of his voice. He accuses me of perhaps accusing him of falling from grace, having some sort of lack of standards. It is extraordinary, a twist of logic, that someone who has not heard what someone else has got to say can feel comfortable to get up and say, `What she is probably going to do is tell me that my standards have fallen'. It is quite the opposite. I accept that Senator Collins has a different view about what we ought to make available to people who want it. We share the view, I am pleased to hear, that the said material is offensive. We obviously have simply a different view about whether it ought to be available. That is where we differ. I am absolutely lost at the relevance of Jimmy Swaggart, and there is no point in me wasting any time on the seven to 10 minutes that Senator Collins donated to this chamber describing what he does on Sunday mornings. I would not degrade the chamber by attempting to verbalise the scenes in the said material to which Senator Collins referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the bush lawyer skills that Senator Collins has displayed. He says that this is a public press release. He indicated to the chamber that it is freely available just about anywhere. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understood the run of Senator Collins's argument, it is that if one publishes some material, for example, to one person and that person publishes it to every Tom, Dick and Harry, the first publisher is responsible for the second publisher's actions. I need not say any more than that. Anybody who has the faintest twinkling with respect to legal matters will understand what I am saying. He further says that I have put children at risk by making this material available. That is his allegation. I am surprised that he does not concern himself with whether or not there are children under 18 years of age opening the mail that arrives, that Australia Post makes money out of delivering, that the taxpayers make money out of delivering this sort of trashy material, and there is no-one at the other end to inquire whether there is an 18-year-old or over going to open it. I am surprised that Senator Collins did not take the opportunity to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this Government participates in making money out of this sort of trashy material by allowing Australia Post to convey it all around Australia from the Australian Capital Territory. If that is not the case and if the Government does not want that to be the case, then let it legislate accordingly. But we have heard in the last couple of days what the Government thinks. It is not going to legislate to stop it. We all know what inquisitive children are like. They say, `Oh, there is a letter for mum, a package for dad; let's have a look'.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Harradine has said, perhaps a child could acquire this material through mail order. But I am simply making the point that one cannot infer that because something is available all over the place and has been available in one place, that the person who first distributed the material has distributed it to the full distribution, nor can we apportion blame so narrowly in that respect. If Senator Collins is friends with members of the Press Gallery who choose to then reproduce and republish material unwisely, then that is his choice and their choice, and I am sorry that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins then made the allegation that I had improperly behaved in some way-and I think I quote correctly-by forcing this material on some unfortunate woman in the Senate Printing Unit. We do not like to call it the reproduction unit any more. I beg to differ with Senator Collins's version of those events. I did send the material down, but plenty of senators have sent material down and had it sent back. I understand that Labor senators are frequently having it sent back with the Printing Unit saying that it is not there for party purposes. So what we do is make a request for something to be done and the Printing Unit will decide whether it is suitable or not, under a whole range of guidelines, and in this instance the Printing Unit said that it was not. I am not offended by that-not at all. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then why did you raise it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was advised that the material, if it were printed, would have breached the relevant guidelines and that it could not so be printed. I said that that was a perfectly satisfactory decision as far as I was concerned and raised the question that this material had been printed by the same unit before. I was then very graciously made the offer that if that were the case and as it had been done before, the Department of the Senate would not want to cause a senator any embarrassment and it would be done again-to which request I responded, `No'. If someone is offended by this material to such an extent that the Printing Unit does not want to print it, then I do not want to ask for that Printing Unit to continue to print it. Those are the facts of the matter, Senator. Had Senator Collins chosen to speak to me prior to raising this matter, I would have given him the benefit of those facts prior to him embarrassing himself by coming here and making allegations that are, in fact, quite untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To summarise that point, I do not regard myself as having forced that material on the Printing Unit at all. I made a request for it to be printed; the request was denied. It is as simple as that. But the denial was followed with an offer to print, which was declined. I do not want to force material on someone who finds it so offensive that as a part of his or her work he does not want to print it-not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to make one other point-that is really to back up a point that I have already made-namely, that if this Parliament is to make sensible laws about what should or should not be available, then it ought to understand what sort of material it is talking about when it uses these catchy little titles like X-rated, R-rated or non-violent erotica. I am quite happy-it is a good thing-that senators will disagree about what material ought to be available and what ought not. I am simply not happy if they engage in that discussion in some form of ignorance as to what the nature of the material is. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the other legal aspects raised by Senator Collins, I am grateful for the contribution of Senator Harradine. I have not yet had an opportunity to fully peruse the particular ordinance to which he refers, but on the basis of the earlier portion of Senator Collins's contribution, I do not have high expectations that the full content of what he said will turn out to be my interpretation of that particular ordinance. </PARA>

If Senator Harradine had done himself the favour of reading the entire debate, he would have realised that the Legislative Assembly enacted that legislation after I initiated the debate to restrict a completely out of hand situation that existed in the Northern Territory at that time. The reason, if Senator Harradine would like to read the whole debate, that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly did not proceed past that point was that the Northern Territory Government stated quite clearly, and I supported it, that before moving further it would await the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (6) The Government, in response to a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies, has approved and issued to DSD a set of rules governing the interception of foreign communications originated by, or directed to, Australian persons.</PARA>
<PARA> Under those rules, DSD is permitted to intercept such communications only under special circumstances and with the approval of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA> DSD has no domestic intelligence role and as a consequence, is not permitted to intercept any internal Australian communications.</PARA>
<PARA> The rules have been modelled on relevant legislation protecting civil liberties in telecommunications interception such as the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. Endorsement of the Rules in no way diminishes the Government's regard for individual rights.</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements are in place for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to regularly monitor compliance by the Defence Signals Directorate with those rules, the purpose of which is to protect the privacy of Australian citizens and permanent residents from intrusion, be it deliberate or incidental, by activities of the Defence Signals Directorate.</PARA>
