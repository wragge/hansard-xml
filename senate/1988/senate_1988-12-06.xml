<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Following the question on my Bill for an Act to provide for voluntary answers to statistical surveys for all surveys save the census itself passing in the negative on a tied vote in the Senate, I now present a new Bill for an Act to amend the ABS Act 1975 to provide for parliamentary supervision of the collection of information for statistical purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to allow for parliamentary scrutiny and, if necessary, rejection of statistical proposals within five sitting days of its tabling in both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements if the Government Statistician wishes to make a compulsory survey then he is required to table his proposals in both Houses of Parliament. There is currently no provision to reject or vary the proposals. This fact makes me wonder why the Statistician did not table the present household expenditure survey which is a compulsory one and thus differs in a most significant way from previous surveys which were voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only surmise that the reason was to keep the increased size, inquisitiveness and expansion of the survey from the view of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The current household expenditure survey has caused great contention, concern and harassment in the community despite denials by the Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA> The Statistician is asking people to disclose intimate details of their household income and expenditure of a most personal nature. Information that could not possibly be of value for determining the CPI, average weekly earnings and pension increases. Information such as the size and nature of bank loans, the collateral offered for them, access to people's bank managers, and other such information up to and including production of their income tax returns. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for having a privacy Bill to protect your tax file in one area when in another area the Statistician can ask you for your tax return. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Statistician has become far too aggressive and assertive and has savaged the parliamentary process and the Clerk of the Senate. For his own reasons and against competent advice from his officers he decided not to table the proposals for the household expenditure survey and yet wanted to compel answers from people on the grounds that the survey was no different from previous ones. This is patently ridiculous and has been admitted by officers of the Bureau in the Estimates committees because other surveys were voluntary and if this one is compulsory that is a significant difference. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will allow for parliamentary scrutiny of survey proposals and their acceptance or rejection. Acceptance will give proposals the authority of parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988 which will make a number of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. I wish to concentrate my remarks on one section of the Bill in particular-that is, the section that repeals the exemption from company taxation of income from goldmining, effective from 1 January 1991; a change announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the May economic statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday in this debate Senator Haines, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, equated our decision to oppose this gold tax with our decision not to oppose the graduate tax and she claimed that she could not see the sense in opposing one and not the other. Let me give the Democrats and Senator Haines the reason for that decision. In my State of Queensland, and I know also in New South Wales, we have suffered from discrimination in the form of a lack of tertiary places, to the extent that 4,000 to 6,000 young people in Queensland will not have the opportunity to go into tertiary education that they would have had if they lived in any other State in Australia. This Government announced that it would increase the number of tertiary places in Queensland by some 4,000 or 5,000 next year and, at the same time, impose the graduate tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Haines quite correctly said, we in the Liberal and National parties will not oppose that tax but we have promised to repeal it in government. Why will we not oppose it? We will not oppose it because the first thing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, would say if we opposed that tax in cooperation with the Democrats would be, `Those places will not be available next year'. Even though we do not approve of and do not support the graduate tax we certainly could not run the risk of depriving between 4,000 and 6,000 young people in my State next year of being able to take the opportunity to attend a tertiary institution. </PARA>
<PARA> On many occasions Senator Haines also expressed great concern about the level of debt and the high debt to equity ratios in our major companies. I ask the Democrats to reconsider their decision on the gold tax. The Democrats come in here and say that they will now support the Government on the gold tax. It should be pointed out that the goldmining industry is one of the few industries in this country where the method of financing companies is almost entirely equity. The Democrats and Senator Haines cannot have it both ways. They complain about negative gearing, about the level of debt and about large corporations borrowing money and thus reducing their level of tax, yet at the same time they come in here and complain that the debt equity ratio is too high; yet we have an industry where it is almost entirely equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement in May 1988 that a gold tax would be introduced in 1991 is probably one of the most stupid things this Government has ever done. Apart from killing the goose that is laying the golden egg it will have a negative effect on mining in the future. I will come to that later. The Government obviously got so carried away with its taxation frenzy that it does not seem to realise it will probably collect less tax over a period as a result of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The gold industry has enjoyed a decade of most spectacular growth, rising to become this country's third largest export earner. It is worth recounting the history of the gold industry. People will recollect that what kicked this country off in the 1850s were the gold rushes. Everyone will have seen the various television series on the gold rushes, with the many groups of people who came from around the world to places such as Ballarat, Bendigo and Kalgoorlie. In 1850 the gold rush brought people to Australia. Gold really formed the basis of this country. It went into a slump, picked up again in 1900 and then went into a further slump. Since 1924 the gold industry, the gold companies, have been exempt from company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons for the continued slump. Honourable senators will probably be aware that, until the early 1970s, if my memory is correct, the gold price was fixed at $US35 an ounce. It was when that price lifted that new incentive came into the industry. The Government has enjoyed a commensurate rise in revenue from taxes on both capital gains and share trading profits on dividends from the gold industry. This is a new tax. Any claims made that the gold- mining industry is not taxed are false. The Government gets tax revenue from all dividends that go to shareholders because the dividends are unfranked. It also gets revenue from all shares sold after September 1985 by way of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Gold analysts believe that this growth phase would have lasted until the end of the century if the gold industry had been left unimpeded and untaxed at the company level. But I repeat that the industry is taxed because shareholders who get dividends, which inevitably they must, pay tax on them. In most cases they are probably taxed at the highest marginal rate. If not, they are certainly taxed at around 40 per cent because the majority of Australians today pay a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent. However, Australia's highest taxing government could not resist the temptation to slug an industry with yet another tax, and we will have a gold tax from 1991. Despite claims by this Government to the contrary, the proposed introduction of a gold tax will affect industry expansion and damage investor confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent studies have been commissioned by the gold industry to try to gauge the effect of the gold tax on the share market and on the Government's overall revenue from industry. When other speakers mentioned the two groups who have done the evaluations, Ernst and Whinney and Arthur Andersen and Co., the remark we got from Senator Walsh was `hired guns'. That was a despicable remark to make about two very prestigious companies in this country. Predictions differ from study to study, but gold analysts agree that the tax will have a negative impact on the gold index. Share prices will almost certainly fall with the introduction of the tax. The upshot is that, while the Government will collect some $300m a year from taxing gold profits, its total tax take from gold will be less with a gold tax because its revenue from tax on capital gains and share trading profits will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The study by Ernst and Whinney found that for every dollar gained by the Government from taxing goldmining profits, potentially in excess of $2 could be lost by way of direct taxes. The Arthur Andersen study calculated that approximately 30 per cent more tax would be collected under the present system, primarily through tax on capital growth of the industry as gold production grows, than from a corporate tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have an industry which is making an incredible contribution to our balance of payments, poor though that may be. Without it, God knows where we would be. This Government wants to take what is essentially a very progressive type of tax system and make it into a lousy system. It is the Government's short-sighted tax grab to get the money up front. This is the same system it used on superannuation. Everyone knows that when it is taken up front there is less at the other end. It is a confidence trick perpetrated on people in superannuation funds. I just draw the parallel. The Government's short-sighted tax grab to yet again get the money up front ignores the considerable evidence that it will get less revenue from the gold tax than it will under the present tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The real act of folly was the Government's advance notice of the gold tax. This is probably the most stupid thing I have seen for many years. By giving a few years notice, the Government is defeating one of the key purposes of its gold tax-to stop the loss of around $100m in revenue each year through repatriated dividends. Thanks to the advance notice, companies which had previously reinvested their gold profits in Australia, thus increasing the wealth of this country and thus increasing employment, are now sending those profits off-shore to take advantage of lower taxes in their own countries. This loophole in the present tax regime could have been effectively closed by imposing a withholding tax on foreign companies at the same rate as if the dividends were paid in Australia. Senator Walsh estimates that foreign treasuries pick up $100m. The Government could simply have done it by introducing a withholding tax at the same rate as if dividends were paid in Australia. The Treasurer fancies himself as a fiscal genius. Surely this would not have been too hard even for him to comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA> Another negative effect of giving advance notice of the tax is that all goldmining companies are now, where possible, high grading. That means that they are mining their most economic areas and maximising the profits before the tax is introduced. I point out that this is being done throughout the country for open cut mines. It is not as easy for underground mines, but it is being done. Once one starts to high grade and takes the most economic reserves, one then sterilises a large number of Australia's reserves until the day comes when the price of gold goes up quite substantially, perhaps doubles. The tax has provided miners with an artificial incentive to exploit the richer ore before the tax is introduced. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Messner says, all new mines are certainly under threat. This is sterilising resources of low grade gold deposits which will only become economic once we get a substantial increase in the price of gold. According to the Government in its May economic statement, the reason for introducing the gold tax was that there was no economic justification for continuing the concession while other industries were fully taxed. They were the words used. What the Government was saying was that it wanted the company-based taxation system to apply as it applies to other industries, ignoring the fact that tax is already applied. It is a very positive sort of tax which has produced great results for this country. The Government's inference that the gold industry does not pay its way is false. The industry is taxed but it is taxed in a positive way. Profits from goldmining companies are taxed in the hands of shareholders when dividends are distributed, because the dividends from goldmining companies are unfranked dividends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Government also collects revenue from tax on capital gains and share trading profit. Profits that are retained for reinvestment into the industry to fund further exploration and mine development are not taxed at that stage. The gold mines currently reinvest most of their profits in further production, thus increasing our wealth and our exports. Hence, the massive increase in the level of exports of gold in this country. The beauty of the goldmining industry's present tax regime is that it encourages savings and investment. This, together with gold prices, has been the prime reason for the spectacular growth of the industry over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Gold is now Australia's fastest growing export earner. In 1985-86-not so long ago-gold was ranked tenth on the major export list, but in the space of two short years it has risen to be the third largest export industry. In 1987-88 goldmining is expected to earn this country in excess of $2.5 billion a year-$2,500m a year-in export income. This is precisely the kind of investment and saving the Government should be encouraging if Australia is to trade its way out of its foreign debt and balance of payments problems. As we all know from the figures we received last month, our net foreign debt increased by $1.6 billion, or at the rate of $65m a day. Neighbouring countries in Asia, such as South Korea, are reducing their debt by in excess of $1 billion a month. Australia is a nation of spenders rather than savers because the Government's measures are a disincentive to save. We need incentives in order to save. Our savings ratio is not only low by world standards, but also has fallen dramatically in the past 10 years. In 1975 it stood at 15 per cent; today it is around 10 per cent. Total investment was 27 per cent of gross domestic product in the 1960s; in the 1970s it was 25 per cent. In 1986-87 it was around 22 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Investment is the engine of economic growth of any country, thus it is the generator of employment. Without that investment we do not have employment; without employment we do not have wealth creation; without wealth creation we cannot provide the necessary services to people who are disadvantaged in the community. It defies commonsense for this Government to dismantle the goldmining industry's present tax regime which encourages the very savings and investment that are so necessary in this country. Instead of shackling the gold industry with a punitive corporate tax rate, the Government should be extending that industry's present positive tax system to other key industries. But the Government's perverse idea of equity and fairness is to ensure that the goldmining industry is equally crippled by punitive taxes as are many of our other industries. Why take a successful industry out of a good system of tax and throw it into a lousy system?</PARA>
<PARA> Various lobby groups often make the claim that their particular industry or commodity is unique and therefore warrants special consideration or exemption. This is a valid claim to make about gold which is one of the world's rare elements. It is at its strongest price-wise when other commodities are depressed. It is a good insurance against hard times, especially given Australia's heavy reliance on commodities. It can double or treble production without depressing world gold prices and is a store of wealth. It is a medium of financial exchange. It is an industry we should be doing everything in our power to encourage. No wonder over the years governments have developed quite a justifiable reputation of taxing efficient wealth creating industries and subsidising, through taxpayers' money, inefficient industries. For goodness sake, why do we not leave the efficient industries alone so they can create wealth and jobs?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government stated in the May economic statement that it did not expect the exemption to impact significantly on the scale of the industry as exploration costs would be deductible. This, of course, is nonsense. The gold tax will effectively cut up-front profit margins by half and it is the first rule of the mining industry, or any industry, that when profit margins drop, exploration or research and development is the first area to get the chop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. The gold industry has already been hard hit. Drilling contractors are suffering a dramatic cutback in exploration projects since the tax was announced in the May mini-Budget, and some have already gone broke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When referring to the remarks made by Senator Haines I mentioned that the gold industry has relied almost entirely on equity, on shareholders' funds, to develop and progress and on the re-investment of profits. Existing mines will continue until costs exceed revenue and then they will go out. What will happen now is that fewer mines will be developed. What the existing industry will do-I am not being critical when I say this as it is a sensible decision-is go into debt, because up until now there has been no benefit to companies from tax deductability of interest, depreciation and so on. They did not get a deduction because they did not pay company tax. It is inevitable that all the costs that apply to other industries will now apply to goldmining, so we will see large debt-equity ratios-the very thing that not only Senator Haines but also Senator Walsh complain about. Senator Walsh would like to see more equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The amended depreciation provisions for mining plant and equipment will add another element of risk and uncertainty to the gold industry. In an age of dwindling natural resources, this tax will lead to an inefficient use of our gold resources. Many goldmining companies will be forced to lift the cut-off grade of the ore being mined to accommodate the tax, making low-grade deposits uneconomic. What a waste of Australia's resources. Resources are good only if they can be exploited economically. If they cannot, they are not worth any more than the dirt that lies over the top of them. It is estimated that as much as one-quarter of Western Australia's low-grade gold bearing ore could stay in the ground as a result of the tax. What a waste of resources, at a time when we have enormous balance of payments problems, when our current foreign debt gross is $120 billion and rising, and when our net debt is $93 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Tailing retreatment and heap leaching operations will also be threatened. For example, Western Mining Corporation Ltd's three million tonne stockpile of low-grade dirt will have to be treated before 1991 because it will become uneconomic and useless after the tax is introduced. The situation is being aggravated by the high grading that I mentioned earlier. Can honourable senators imagine the Minister for Finance telling financial institutions what the exchange rate will be in 1991 and the effect that that would have? What the Government has done is say that in 1991 there will be a punitive tax and so the industry reacts accordingly with high grading. </PARA>
<PARA> The gold tax will jeopardise not only the goldmining industry but also its associated service industries and communities which rely on the industry. This was made very clear to the Government when the Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, crossed the floor in the other place. He comes from Kalgoorlie and has seen what the gold industry has done to revitalise that area. Particularly hard hit will be Western Australia, where over 70 per cent of Australia's gold is produced. Even the Labor Premier of Western Australia-I do not know how serious he was; possibly he was protecting his political hide-described the gold tax as `a clear breach of faith' with the Western Australian Government and the community. What he meant by that was that, yet again, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had broken another promise. Before the last election the Prime Minister of this country went over there and said, `There will not be a gold tax in the next term of government'. He is saying that he has sort of honoured his promise because, although he has introduced the legislation now, it will not come into effect until 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent survey commissioned by Australian mining exporting companies found that 73 per cent of Western Australians opposed the tax. One cannot blame them. Their livelihoods depend on the industry and may now be at risk. Certainly, future growth will be at risk. The electorate will show the Hawke Government what it thinks of the gold tax at the next election. It is yet another tax; yet another broken promise; and it shows, yet again, that neither this Government nor its Prime Minister can be trusted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) contains measures which include a corporate tax on gold and arrangements for employee share acquisition schemes and transitional imputation. I am going to direct my comments towards the corporate tax on gold. This is probably the most important taxation Bill that has come before this place since 1924, which was the year that Australia saw fit, for grave economic reasons of the time, to remove the corporate tax on gold to boost gold exploration and production. This was done to attract investment from overseas, to attract migration after World War I and to boost export income to enable Australia to overcome the debts it had acquired during World War I. The results at the time were tremendous, with a return to the gold rush days enjoyed in the latter part of the nineteenth century and the immediate years which led up to World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gold rush towns of Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Southern Cross, Leonora, Laverton, Malcolm, Cue, Daydawn, Wiluna, Meekatharra, Kukynie, Mount Magnet, Lancefield and Norseman, as well as their counterparts in the eastern States, boomed and blossomed, making Australia part of the roaring twenties which we have heard so much about, This preceded the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Depression of the thirties. With the advent of that disastrous depression, mining was the one and only industry which did not feel the pinch of the downturn. Whilst cities had queues for work, the dole or whatever, with professionals out of work and doing menial jobs-when they could get those menial jobs-the goldfields were bursting at the seams. I remember my father telling me that in mining towns-Broken Hill, incidentally, was not a goldmining town-in Kalgoorlie and my own home town of Southern Cross, Western Australia, which is 100 years old this year and was the first developed goldfield of Western Australia - -</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Messner. These mining towns did not know what depression meant because of the boom in gold production. Those towns were the last bastions of non-depression. Goldmining prospered till World War II, when most mines closed because of the lack of manpower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The end of World War II saw a minor revival, even though some of the marginal producers did not reopen. Activity remained in the main centres, like Kalgoorlie, till the early 1970s when production-except at Mount Charlotte, which was the only mine working in the eastern goldfields-ceased altogether. Fortunately, the nickel boom of that time saved the goldfields. Intensive exploration led to the eventual development of the nickel mines such as Kambalda and Scotia and the most famous, Windarra, at Poseidon. A lot of the gold that was discovered was later brought on tap in the present gold boom. One of those discoveries was a big find at Kambalda. </PARA>
<PARA> Goldmining remained dormant till around 1983, when we saw the current revival. It was a timely revival, because at that time we had the worst levels of unemployment since the Depression-a disastrous situation. Also at that time there was a downturn in the rural sector and without the revival of mining Australia would have been in a far worse situation. I have said time and time again in this place that those two great industries achieve 85 per cent of Australia's export income. It has been the usual pattern, over the last 100 years, that when the mining sector is down the agricultural sector is up. But at present, Australia needs both sectors to be up at the same time in order to get over this Government's disastrous balance of trade problem. Fortunately, since 1982 the agricultural sector has also risen. Hopefully, those two sectors can pull Australia out of the mire which it has been in and is still in. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two good reasons for this great revival in the goldmining industry. One was the price of gold and the other was the lure of freedom from corporate tax, causing money to pour in from overseas. Very little of this money ever goes back. I know from reading that of every thousand goldmining floats in Australia only one venture ever produces gold. Presumably, most of these eventually pay a dividend. But we should look at the expenditure that goes into employment, machinery, materials, lease money paid to the mining departments around Australia, rates to local government and so forth. How does one justify a differential tax system for a particular industry purely on economic criteria? I believe that one should look at the contribution it makes to export income and the contribution it makes to employment. I will deal with them separately. </PARA>
<PARA> Export income has never been needed as much as it is now. We have a record current account deficit at a level never seen before in Australia, even when primary producers have been earning near record income from wheat, wool, beef, sugar and coal in the past two years. Despite these record export earnings, more and more income is needed to try to address the current account deficit. Gold is certainly doing its bit towards the situation. I have a list of export figures for gold showing that in 1982 Australia was produ-cing 13,076 kilograms per year and earning $135m. In 1987 we produced 86,402 kilograms worth $1.6 billion, and in the first two quarters of 1988 Australia has already earned $882m. Bearing in mind that the summer is yet to come, with the better weather conditions, so open cuts can be worked with fewer problems-more gold is produced in Australia in summer than in winter-the figure of $2 billion will soon be achieved. That is on the export side. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to the other main aspect, employment. The employment figures show that in 1982-83 goldmining employed 3,140 men and women around Australia. In 1983-84 the figure jumped to 4,058; in 1984-85 it moved to 4,184; in 1985-86, 5,177; and in 1986-87, 6,582. At the same time wages and salaries rose from $69.6m to $196.1m. Of course, it does not stop at that point. The multiplying factor provides jobs far beyond that number. They are real jobs, not one's created by government spending. Figures from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade show that the multiplying factor in the goldmining industry lies at 2.9, which means that approximately 19,000 other jobs flow directly from goldmining, with a related wages bill. These extra 19,000 jobs may be far removed from the goldfields, being provided by manufacturers and suppliers of goods in the cities. I also have a sheet here which shows those figures and which I will seek leave to incorporate later. </PARA>
<PARA> Last evening in this place I listened to Senator Haines speaking. She maintained that rather than give preferential treatment to the goldmining industry, there should be more done towards encouraging small business. I know no better way to encourage small business than to have a buoyant large business whereby the benefits flow from it. If there is money in the towns, if the companies spend money and the employees spend money, that is where the small businesses really do well and they do not need any other incentive. In my home town in about 1982 the rural sector was starting to decline and goldmining was in the doldrums; small businesses that had remained in the same family for the last 50 or 60 years were virtually at the end of their tether. I have been speaking to them and with the upturn in the goldmining industry they are certainly not complaining now and they can see a great future ahead of them. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect that is forgotten in this debate is that the price of gold was fixed by the International Monetary Fund until 1974, at, I believe, $38 an ounce. The Government Mint was the sole buyer and it was illegal for any person, other than a producer, to hold gold. All this time a price 10 times higher could have been obtained overseas and a black market existed for anyone willing to try to get that gold out of Australia. I can remember an incident at Fremantle, where a car was being loaded on to a passenger liner, where for some unknown reason the crane drivers could not balance the car. They had the standard sling which balances a car by having a platform under each axle. Every time they tried to lift it, it was off balance. After a while the car was put aside and the next morning we all read in the press how that car had a lot of gold stacked in the sump. Obviously some people went to the trouble of taking the sump off, putting the gold in and putting the sump back on; but they were caught. Those are the measures that people who possessed gold took to get it out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably the Government, through the Mint, was buying from the producers and selling at world prices and pocketing the difference. This is commonly forgotten. The gold companies could have reaped billions during those times and could have expanded much further. As I said, in my chronology of events we are at the latest boom and so the Government is looking at yet another new tax to add to its increasing list of new taxes to pay for its expanding spending mode, a spending mode that it got out of control. The Government will not tighten its own belt when it expects others to tighten theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators do not know the effects that the latest upsurge in goldmining is having on the economy, they should visit, or better still it should be compulsory for every senator and member to visit, the mining areas of Western Australia. I know that half a dozen of my colleagues who disbelieved the effects, visited those areas two months ago and came back with a vastly different opinion. These mines are situated in Australia's harshest environment, bordering some of Australia's desert regions-places like Laverton, Wiluna, Meekatharra and Telfer. Incidentally, my theory on the Telfer mine, which is the only real gold producing mine in the Pilbara area, distanced from a lot of other areas, is that it is Lasseter's lost reef. In summer those places reach 48 degrees and often stay over 40 degrees at night, with minimal winter rains. </PARA>

Miners and their families put up with harsh conditions in order to man the mines. As a result, they do much for our export income. If anyone from the comfortable cities of Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide-Senator Haines's home city-made a visit to those areas and saw for themselves the harsh and inhospitable conditions that people are forced to contend with, they would soon change their minds and realise that this industry does deserve preferential treatment. How many in this place would live and work in those areas? I have already given the figures relating to the economy since the upturn, and at this stage I seek leave to incorporate them in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to popular belief, or as the Government would have everybody believe, dividends in the hands of Australian shareholders will be taxed at the taxpayer's marginal rate, whatever that may be. This was borne out by Senator Parer. As he said, this could quite easily be 49c in the dollar. This is because the dividends coming from goldmining companies are unfranked, as they do not pay corporate tax. Further, unfranked dividends going to foreign countries will be subject to two-way agreements between Australia and the other country. Most agreements provide for a withholding tax of 15 per cent. Alongside that, there is no deductability of exploration or production costs. Tax is also paid on the by-products of goldmining such as silver and lead. As I have already mentioned, other minerals are found in exploration which could then be mined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How much is this hungry Government missing out on the collection of tax? Everyone pays the withholding tax. Under these agreements there is a 15 per cent withholding tax on dividends going overseas. Conversely, tax is paid by others overseas. So if there is an equal amount going in or coming out-I presume that there is more going in than coming out-30 per cent will be reached in no time. So how much are we missing out on? It is certainly not as much as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) keeps telling us in this chamber. He would have us believe that foreign treasuries are the only ones that will lose by having a corporate tax on gold. This is not correct. I am sure that most senators in this chamber are of the belief that all dividends going overseas are completely free of tax. That is not correct. I suppose one could say, as was mentioned earlier by Senator Parer, that the solution would be to raise the withholding tax rate to the new corporate tax rate of 39c or even to 49c, being the top marginal tax rate. But what would happen to the agreements? To do this would mean changing those existing agreements. Honourable senators should remember that the agreements are a two-way effort. If we increased withholding tax on dividends going overseas then other countries logically would do the same to us. This would mean that the Australian Treasury would miss out. Senator Walsh has conveniently forgotten to tell us of this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to a letter that most honourable senators and members in this place would have received from Sir Arvi Parbo on the gold tax matter. I presume everyone would say that he has an axe to grind on this matter. His letter certainly does make sense. Incidentally, for those who think that Sir Arvi Parbo was always Sir Arvi and spent all his life in his fiftieth floor office in Melbourne, that is not correct. I knew him as a very ordinary man working as a shift boss underground in my home town of Southern Cross. He is certainly to be congratulated on where he has got to in this world, especially starting from such a place. It is a long way from Southern Cross to Chairman of BHP. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The integration method as now applied to gold mining has the advantage that undistributed company profits are not taxed in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> Such profits are invariably applied towards further development and investment, and more funds are therefore available from internal company resources-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, without borrowing-</PARA>
<PARA> for these vital purposes. Encouragement of more investment in productive activities is, as we all know, absolutely essential for the future of Australia. The undistributed profits will not go untaxed, because additional dividends and capital gains resulting from reinvestment are taxed in shareholders' hands when received. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. I would also like to quote from the Senate Hansard of 9 September 1925 on the goldmining industry. Senator Lynch from Western Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA> the gold-mining industry is one whose home is essentially in the back-blocks. It belongs to all the States, even though Western Australia is the main producer. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no State of the Commonwealth that is not a contributor to the gold production of the Commonwealth. It is true that the contribution of Western Australia is in the neighbourhood of 70 per cent., which may change, but those of us who are large-minded enough to let our eyes wander beyond the boundaries of our States realize that if good can be done to any one State, especially in a pioneering industry, the benefit it creates is not confined within the boundaries of that State, but necessarily overflows into the neighbouring States with a consequent advantage to the whole of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are still true today. The Government intends to raise $300m out of this taxing measure when it comes into action. But if we look at the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) we see that in the first instance the savings figure is $870m. I presume that is a typographical error-I hope it is-but it does show how much the relevant department has done its homework. As well, I am not sure that savings in later years will be in the order of $300m when we take into account the tax already being paid, and bearing in mind the other comments I have made. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate that this is the most important mining industry Bill that has come before this Parliament since 1924. It is so important because it attempts to reintroduce a tax on the industry. As the Senate well knows, the coalition is opposing the measure. Our reason for opposing it goes far beyond next year's election in Western Australia. I am not silly enough to claim that our stance may not have an effect on that election, but our reasons do go far beyond it. When the election results in Western Australia have been forgotten, the effects of this legislation will remain. It is an important measure that will last for the next 100 years. I must put on the record my appreciation for at least one member of the Australian Labor Party who, in the other House, had the guts to cross the floor in support of the area he represents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the time constraints imposed upon us this week and next my remarks will be very brief. The Senate is debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988. Senator Panizza has just read out to the Senate the amendment moved by Senator Messner on behalf of the Opposition. It is not often that I totally agree with the Opposition, but I do so on this particular occasion. However, I do not think the Opposition has gone far enough. Paragraph (b) of the amendment suggests that as a result of the insidious effects of bracket creep an estimated $7 billion has been ripped off Australian taxpayers since 1985-86. That is not the only thing that has led to the loss of living standards experienced by taxpayers, particularly those with dependent children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fairness to the Opposition, I note that yesterday this was raised as a matter of public importance, and justifiably so. This proposed legislation is going to bite. It is biting right now. It is hurting the people of Australia, those workers and taxpayers with dependants who are paying their way in this community. More and more of those people are being forced to the wall by this Government's taxation policies and by its failure to recognise the importance of raising children in this country. This situation makes me furious. This has been boiling up within me over the last year or two because of the ignorance and arrogance of this Government; because of its pitiful ignorance of what its policies mean for an ordinary person with a dependent spouse and children to raise a family. It is all very well for those Ministers who have no dependants or who are on a fat salary. Indeed, under the Hawke Government the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal will enable Ministers to cop salary increases. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House doubts it. The Tribunal's recommendations for salary increases were based on the assumption that Ministers and the Government were doing their job. But Ministers and this Government have failed in their fundamental task of treating Australian families fairly, and particularly those with dependent children. Added to what is contained in the Opposition's amendment-I suppose it assumes that this argument was dealt with yesterday-I point out that a family with dependent children and with an income just above the family assistance supplement level does not receive a very large income. We know that taxpayers earning $25,000, with the appropriate number of dependent children for comparison purposes, have suffered a loss since 1984 of 12 per cent in disposable income alone, and we can add to that the further depressed living standards they are suffering because of the amounts they now have to pay to meet their mortgage obligations and because of the increase in direct taxation that is being imposed on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills we are considering further extend sales tax to certain food items-items which are very popular amongst children. Unless the Government takes stock of what it is doing to the family, it will definitely suffer a defeat at the next election, and it deserves to suffer that defeat if it does not take stock of the damage it is doing to the economic and social stability of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the limitation of time, I turn to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988. I want to deal with that Bill very briefly by translating it into a practical example of the effect of this Government's actions. I want to deal with the effect that this action could well have on an industry in Beaconsfield in northern Tasmania, where there is quite high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Beautiful Beaconsfield, as it is justifiably called, is a very desirable place to live and it is very different from the areas of most goldmines in Western Australia, which are situated in most inhospitable areas. But not so Beaconsfield. There is an extremely high unemployment rate in Beaconsfield and an attempt is being made by Beaconsfield Goldmines Ltd, a company which was formed solely for the purpose of raising funds to develop an old Tasmanian mine. We are not talking about billionaires here; we are talking about a company which has about 2,300 small shareholders in Tasmania alone. People are prepared to risk their capital to see whether this mine could be opened. The mine was quite profitable but it was closed early this century. Although the pumps were probably the most efficient pumps in the world at that time they were not able to keep the water out of the mine, so it became flooded. </PARA>
<PARA> Money is being spent on re-establishing the collar at the old shaft and an attempt will be made to dewater the shaft. I went down there yesterday and had a look at it. A very good job is being done. There are steel girders and cement all the way down the shaft to the 74-metre mark. The people doing this work have cleaned out the mine down to the 74-metre mark and they have to get through the cave in down to the 92-metre mark before there is a clear go to the 1,500-metre mark. I say `a clear go to the 1,500-metre mark' because while it appears to be clear of rubble, and cave in soil from the 92-metre to the 1,500-metre level, the shaft is still full of water. The company is spending $2,000 a day just to pump the water out. The engineers and geologists on the site are proposing to adopt a new method of damming the water by boring holes into the ground and using a grouting method to keep back the water from the actual mine. It is a very interesting process and they have high hopes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is wealth in that ground not only for that area of Tasmania but also for the whole of Australia, but the Government is changing the ground rules. These people committed funds on the basis that a tax would not be imposed on the company. I am not going over old ground; it has already been said that the goldmining industry is not free from tax; far from it. I am just talking about a very small operation which would be of great benefit not only for that area but for the whole of Australia. I say that it will benefit that area because at present only 20 or 30 jobs are involved as people are trying to clear out the shaft, but those jobs are still important in the Beaconsfield area at present. But when construction takes place 140 jobs, or thereabouts, will be involved and, when the mine is in full time production there will be about 100 full time jobs, which will be very significant for the Beaconsfield area. </PARA>

About $10m has been sunk down that mine over recent years. When the company comes to the second stage of dewatering the shaft and confirming the estimates of the ore body, that will cost, say, another $20m and it will require a further commitment which the company has not yet received from the shareholders; it will ask for some more. I ask honourable senators to put themselves in the shoes of a small shareholder. Would they be game to put in the extra $2,000, $5,000 or $10,000 when the ground rules have been changed?

<PARA>that is the Executive Director's name-</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that there appears to be an element of uncertainty among members of the Australian Goldmining Industry Council about the Government's intention concerning the tax exemption for goldmining income, despite my public statements on the matter. </PARA>

It dashes the hopes of the people who have expended their money in this area. I appeal to this Government: I am giving a practical example of small shareholders who are likely to have lost their money down that shaft.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988. I, like many of my colleagues, wish to address one particular point in the Bill that very much affects the well-being of my State of Western Australia. This final piece of taxation legislation for 1988 has one highly significant feature for my State and for Australia's future export earnings. The Bill will impose a corporate tax on gold in 1991, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) foreshadowed last May. We have just heard Senator Harradine quite correctly talking about disposable promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is very much for that reason, but also for our fundamental philosophic reasons, that we in the Opposition are opposing such a measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How convenient it is that this measure is being pushed through Parliament before a detailed study commissioned by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies Inc. in Western Australia can be completed and made available for public debate. What has the Government to fear in waiting for that study to be completed and debated? Why is there a need to rush this measure through the Parliament now when the Government proposes that it come into effect in 1991?</PARA>
<PARA> We are debating a Bill the undoubted effect of which will be to damage Australia's third greatest export industry after coal and wool, and at a time when one of our greatest continuing economic problems is the current account deficit, which is $12 billion in 1987-88. This means that Australia's ratio of foreign debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is now 42 per cent. That is a rather sick figure when it is compared with figures of 27 per cent for Great Britain, 12 per cent for the United States of America and 7 per cent for Japan. This Hawke Labor Government has all but abandoned its Budget prediction that the 1988-89 deficit will be $9.5 billion. The first four months of 1988-89 have already produced an accumulated deficit of $5.5 billion-larger by $800m than for the same period last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The gold industry is one of the major economic success stories of the decade, with strong investment growth and export performance. It is a great tragedy that this Government has seen fit to try to ruin such a viable industry. This is an industry which in 1978 produced 17 tonnes of gold, which this year will have produced 140 tonnes of gold and which next year will produce 170 tonnes. The value of gold production has risen from less than $300m a decade ago to $2.25 billion in 1988. That is some increase. </PARA>
<PARA> What disturbs me about this proposal is that we will see the industry decline. One can forget that the gold industry is instrumental to the survival of a number of remote communities in Western Australia that produces 71 per cent of Australia's gold. I, however, choose not to forget that. Not only are those people my constituents, but also they provide great economic viability for this entire country, not just for my State of Western Australia. The bottom line surely is that $2.25 billion of export earnings are essential to Australia as a nation. Second to this, but of real importance, is the fact that not only is the gold industry responsible for 4,200 direct jobs in production and exploration but also its multiplier effect on employment in associated labour intensive industries has created some 41,000 jobs, all of which return income tax revenue to the Government. Company tax is paid by those firms which supply the gold industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is an absolute and utter fallacy for this Government to say that the gold industry is tax exempt. The gold industry is paying tax at every other level. Surely we as a nation should be looking more to reducing taxes instead of imposing them. Each additional $1m invested in goldmining results in an increase of $1.7m in national income, and each additional $1m in gold exports increases Australia's GDP by $1.9m, with a $3.3m rise in gross output. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh and other members of this Labor Government seize upon the mantle of economic rationalism as a justification for the corporate taxation of gold production, yet, to my mind, the essential task of a responsible government committed to economically rational goals is to maximise Australia's export income and maintain its revenue base without the creation of new taxes. It is not, therefore, prudent fiscal management for a government, using the excuse of consistency in taxation-that false excuse of consistency-to sacrifice $2 in direct revenue for each $1 gained through the new corporate tax on gold. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of 51 major goldmining and exploration companies by Ernst and Whinney has indicated that, had a corporate tax on goldmining profits been in place from 1 March this year, the Government would have gained $363m in current and future revenue. However, by not imposing such a tax, the Government would gain current and future revenue to the tune of $807m. That is quite a difference, but it seems to matter not to this Labor Government. Quite apart from the 51 major companies that the gold index used for this exercise, the impact of the tax on 400 other companies would have an additional adverse effect on Government revenue. All too often this Government has sought to justify its decision by disinformation. Senator Walsh, of course, is a very clever master of that. He has adopted the tactic of labelling Western Australian gold producers as tax cheats and spivs, and he does not bother to check his facts. So far he has falsely accused one individual of having served a prison sentence. That does not matter to him. He does not care what he says to or about people. He has also claimed that 35 per cent of gold production is under foreign ownership. I suggest that Senator Walsh update his figures a bit because his figures on foreign ownership are in fact two years out of date. Only 18 per cent of the industry is foreign owned. </PARA>
<PARA> What is very distressing about this is that Senator Walsh happens to be a Western Australian senator which I think he conveniently forgot a long time ago, as did the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) who has tried to float a line that because new mines are starting production this year, it somehow indicates that the proposed corporate tax will do the gold industry no harm. Parading such an argument adds insult to injury, particularly when it comes from a Western Australian senator. Senator Cook's list of 30 supposedly new mines names two mines in the wrong States. For the benefit of Senator Cook and his learning process Union Reefs and Doughboy Creek are not in Western Australia. One is in the Northern Territory and the other in Queensland. Neither is producing. And he claims to be a senator from Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right, Senator Boswell, not to mention the Minister for Resources. They are two handles to his name that one would think would qualify him to talk with some knowledge on the subject. Another supposedly new mine at Mount Gibson is simply a deeper lode of an existing operation and another at Mullagine is a two-man tailings plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More significantly, Senator Cook did not mention that other mines on his list such as Forrest Belle near Menzies have only small desposits that will be mined out in a matter of months. The basic fallacy of Senator Cook's argument is that the short term production increases that will undoubtedly occur do not signal any kind of long term or medium term prosperity for the industry. It is in fact part of a process created by this Government that is wasting the future prospects of the gold industry. We, as a nation, cannot afford to see all of those opportunities being thrown out the window. It is elementary economic sense for gold producers to maximise, and in many cases, finalise production ahead of 1991. Obviously, the Government could not give a continental about that prospect because by then it will not be in government. It has a problem but it does not care; it just wants all of this in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also equally interesting-my colleague Senator Panizza mentioned this a little while ago-that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, pragmatically crossed the floor when the vote on this Bill was taken in the House of Representatives. There was nothing clever or brave in his actions. He simply saw where he could get his votes and where he could lose them at the next election. He chose to go against Caucus and cross the floor. Normally that type of action means expulsion for a member of the Labor Party. But, oh no, not this time, all he got was a hit across the back of the hand with a feather. He was prevented from going to Caucus for three months, most of which time the Parliament is not sitting and Caucus will not be meeting. So what was brave about Mr Campbell's position? Absolutely nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that there are five honourable senators in this place from the Labor Party who supposedly represent Western Australia-Senators Walsh, Cook, McKiernan, Beahan and Giles. I have not heard one iota from any one of them who might even be thinking of voting to oppose this piece of legislation. Oh no! That would be taking it one step too far. Then of course we have Senator Jenkins of the Australian Democrats from Western Australia. What is her position? She does not care too much about the industry in Western Australia. She does not care too much about her constituents who will be very adversely affected by this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Then of course we have Senator Vallentine-the senator for staying away from Parliament. It will be interesting to see where Senator Vallentine is when the vote is taken on this because she is generally not here. If she is in the building she only comes in to be seen and then goes out again. She has no interest in this. She has no interest in the economic viability of this whole proposition and no interest in the constituents that it affects. We have seven senators out of 12 who will vote in favor of this dreadful course of action to be taken in 1991. Only the five Liberal senators from Western Australia will be opposing this. </PARA>
<PARA> In its tortuous method of paying lip service to yet another disposable election promise, this Labor Government has created a huge disincentive for development after 1991 so that it can claim, as Senator Harradine pointed out earlier, that it did not introduce a gold tax in the lifetime of the Thirty-fifth Parliament; it merely legislated for one. I was in Kalgoorlie during the last election campaign on the day the Prime Minister announced that there would be no gold tax. I think Senator Panizza was with me on that particular day. The people of Kalgoorlie were ecstatic but I must admit that they were also very wary, but obviously not wary enough to vote against what was blatantly untrue and what we now see as completely untrue. It was purely and simply a decision that the Prime Minister made on that day when he happened to be swanning around Perth at some stage. He decided that he would announce that there would be no gold tax. What has that meant? It means absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased production of which Senator Cook boasts will concentrate increasingly on the highest grades of ore so that low grade deposits will become totally uneconomic after 1991, not only through the imposition of corporate tax but also because lodes of high grade ore will have been mined. The availability of higher grade deposits has, in the past, made economic the development of lower grades. But that will all be wiped out. The Western Mining Corporation's three million tonne stockpile of low grade ore accumulating at 100,000 tonnes per month will be worthless unless it is processed before 1991. It has been estimated that in Western Australia some 30 million tonnes of low grade ore that a corporate tax will render uneconomic could yield more than one million ounces of gold. Once again, the Government does not seem to care that there is a future in that low grade ore. It simply does not want to know about it because this is a disincentive that will be in place at a time when all the high grade mining has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> I defy this Government or any honourable senator voting for this tax to deny that it will shorten the lives of mines and discourage the development of deep mines that require a longer lead time than open cut operations. Equally, it defies credibility to argue that many of the mines currently in production or about to commence production would have come on stream if a corporate tax had been operating in recent years. It is most unlikely that gold production in the eastern States would have been commercially feasible except with the present incentive based tax regime. Those two words-incentive based-are very important because that is what we have seen in this industry for a long time. That incentive will now be removed as of 1991. We will see the demise of the gold industry just as we have seen it grow in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The classic example of the real state of the goldmining industry was the opening last month in Kalgoorlie of the Wombola goldmine. This deposit of low grade ore is being fast tracked by Croesus Mining using profits of $7m obtained from its predecessor, the Hannans South Pit. Wombola is being started up only because a corporate tax does not yet apply. From 1991 the whole world will be different because such a mine will not be an economic possibility. The company can only hope to discover a reserve with sufficient potential to withstand the taxation impost. Within two years this company has expanded from 320 to 5,035 shareholders. No doubt Senator Walsh would call them spivs too. He likes name-calling. As I said, he does not care much about what he calls people-whether it is accurate or not. The Wombola mine is typical of enterprise in the goldmining industry and it underscores the fact that mines will not operate unless they can make a profit. The profit margins of smaller companies will be wiped out by this tax change. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, a study is under way to determine the actual and projected effects of the 1991 tax on gold production and its associated industries in Western Australia. While this may not be completed before the new year, there is already mounting evidence of the adverse effects of the new tax. It may be a very wise question to ask, but what has the Government got to fear in waiting for that report on the industry? Why is it rushing into it? Why does it not want to know the facts behind the industry as they are today and not what the Government knew them to be quite some time ago? It is simply a case of putting the blinkers on and hoping for the best. Already members of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies have reported that seven gold deposits in Western Australia are on ice because corporate taxation would wipe out profit from the development of a marginal deposit. Obviously, capital raising after 1991 will be drastically curtailed. Up to the pre-sent some 90 per cent of mineral search in Australia has been for new gold deposits. Small wonder, therefore, that the exploration industry is already severely affected by the 1991 tax. At a conservative estimate there has been a 50 per cent fall-off in exploration over the past year. That is according to the Kalgoorlie Chairman of the Drilling Industry Association, Dr Brian Mann. Once again, Senator Walsh and Senator Cook would dispute that. They would say that that is something Senator Knowles has plucked out of the air, but it happens to be fact, a fact that this Government should not and could not deny, but of course it will. </PARA>
<PARA> A casual visitor to Kalgoorlie today will certainly notice the number of drilling rigs lying idle. That is another source of concern. Although there has been an increase in exploration in the immediate proximity of proven ore bodies, pure exploration has been savagely curtailed. Exploration budgets for 1988-89 have in many cases been spent before the end of October, a classic indication that the 1991 tax has already destroyed the long term prospects of the industry. It does not say much for the current health of the drilling industry that an operator recently informed a mining tenement owner near Geraldton that he would happily leave the rig there ready for subsequent work two or three months away. Last year it would have been unheard of for equipment to lie idle in this manner and for such a long time. But that is the effect this proposal is having on the industry now. Again, it is significant to learn that the air charter industry in Kalgoorlie reports an 80 per cent decline in the business of servicing exploration companies. All these indicators prove one thing, namely, that the industry already is going down even though it is fighting the tax and is extremely busy trying to get the high grade ore out. We have to ensure that we know and understand the ramifications of this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not, as the Government would have us believe, pleading a special tax privilege for the gold industry. We are not just making a decision on the run; we have always been committed to opposing a gold tax. It is not a decision that was made in the last few weeks or since May when the Treasurer announced this gold tax for 1991. We have always been opposed to it. It concerns me sometimes that even parts of the industry do not understand that we have always been opposed to it. There is no future in trying to penalise an industry in such a fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1924 the industry has been exempt from only corporate taxation in recognition of the fact that goldmining relies on its profits to pay its expenses in a relatively short term, given the generally short lives of individual mines. That pinpoints one of the major differences. These mines are very different from many other mines. They are not the same and they should not be treated in the same fashion. As the dividends from goldmining companies cannot be franked, they are fully taxable in the hands of shareholders, who are also liable for capital gains tax when the shares are sold. Once again, it is a fallacy for this Government to say that the industry and all those associated with it are exempt from tax. They simply are not. It is probably too much to expect from this Labor Government that it consider extending tax incentives to other forms of mineral production, rather than seeking to end a supposed anomaly. Why cannot tax incentives be extended to other industries?</PARA>

It is not a figure that is just plucked out of the air. It is a figure that has been certified by the Chief Executive of the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, Mr Peter Ellery. The industry was left with a 6.5 per cent return on its investment. Yet this Government says it needs to be taxed more. It already has three levels of government chomping away at its heels. Why does it need more? This is the broad picture that this Labor Government chooses to ignore. It simply does not want to know about it.

Shame on Senator McKiernan for being a part of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After recent visits to goldmining areas in New South Wales and Western Australia-both small and large mines-I am well aware of the impact the imposition of such a tax would have on a most buoyant industry. It is not just the mining companies themselves that will suffer. All the associated industries-some 1,500 of them-in cities such as Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne and, I might add, in very marginal Labor seats-will also suffer. Let us wait and see what happens at the next election as a result of the Government's foreshadowed gold tax impost. It will have far-reaching implications for the Government-not just in places such as Kambalda and the other major mining towns of Australia but all over Australia in areas where people are associated with the industry. For instance, the people who produce the drills in Brisbane, the people who produce the diamond drills in Sydney, the people who produce the chemicals used in the industry will suffer dramatic cutbacks as a result of the introduction of this tax. Senator Harradine, in a most eloquent speech today, mentioned the shareholders. They too will be affected because the mining companies will no longer be viable. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that something like $1 gained in tax will lose the country $2 in export income, or $2 in earnings for the mining companies. We will not break our commitment to oppose the gold tax. The Opposition has been very firm on this right from the start. In June 1987 the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are totally opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA>We are standing firm. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A gold tax would jeopardise the future of many existing mines and prevent the opening of new ones. Exploration and the level of investment in this important sector would also decline rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has acted differently. It has made it known, through the introduction of the Bill, that it condones a gold tax. It is interesting to note than on 7 July 1987 our Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, gave the public an undertaking that he would not introduce a gold tax during the next three-year term of a Labor government. That was another broken promise. It makes one wonder when the broken promises will finish. That is another example of why this Government has earned a reputation as the highest taxing government in Australia's history. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter to Mr Carmichael from Senator Button dated 23 July 1987. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Carmichael</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you about the matter of a gold tax which I understand has come up in the context of your consideration of the coverage of the Jewellery reference. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing the reference it was not my intention to have the Commission re-open the question of introducing a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue was considered by the Government following the August 1986 ``Gutman'' report on the taxation of gold mining. In response to that report, the Government decided not to introduce a gold tax because the importance of encouraging exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the gold mining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter dated 7 July 1987 to Mr Duncan Bell, Chairman of the Australian Goldmining Industry Council, the Prime Minister gave an undertaking that the Government would not introduce a gold tax during its third term of office. A copy of the letter is attached. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Government's commitment to the industry, I consider it would be inappropriate for the Commission to examine the taxation of gold mining in the context of this reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. As I have said, the Government has a working reputation of being the highest taxing government in Australia's history. In July 1983, four months after this Government was elected, it introduced a tax on lump sum superannuation. The next month, in its first Budget, Treasurer Keating introduced new excise taxes on fuel, beer and cigarettes. For good measure, he also threw in an assets test on pensioners. In December 1983, the Government cut the tax exemption for Army reservists by 50 per cent. In February 1984 it introduced a Medicare levy-a health tax. In July 1984, it introduced a resource rent tax. That will come back to haunt the Australian people in terms of oil exploration. In August 1984, wine sales tax and fuel excise tax were increased. In June 1985, in the face of a blow-out in the deficit, Treasurer Keating unveiled his great tax White Paper with much fanfare. Who can remember the details three years later? There were promises of major tax changes to spread the burden more equitably. In September 1985 the new Keating package was unveiled with the introduction of capital gains taxes and the disallowance of entertainment expenses. In May 1986 the fringe benefits tax legislation was introduced into Parliament and this has really hit the the mining industries in isolated areas. In July 1986 the corporate tax rate was increased from 46c to 49c. The famous tax arm of the trilogy was broken in the fourth Labor Budget in August 1986. The Medicare levy was increased and fuel excise went up a further 3c a litre-a 300 per cent increase in excise in three years under a Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am bringing these facts to the attention of the Senate today because they demonstrate the fact that extra taxes and imposts have been put on the Australian community-in this particular case, they have been put on a productive industry. The promised tax cuts announced two years ago have been deferred. Bracket creep is knocking the heck out of average taxpayers. Senator McKiernan, when he goes back to Western Australia, must not forget to tell his people about the promised tax cut which will come in in July next year. This promised tax cut will mean that every average wage earner with two dependent children will have to be given $56 a week extra. Let us wait to see what happens. Let us see whether the Australian people are given the promised tax cuts next year or whether this will be another broken promise. Let us see whether the tax cuts will restore the average wage earner's weekly take home pay to its comparative level in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan has given a good argument about why he wants to tax his people in Western Australia out of existence. But such arguments are often based on the reasoning that if other industries pay tax, why should the gold companies not have to pay up? Such questions are based on a very broad misunderstanding of how the system really works. Senator McKiernan has probably been down mines more than anyone in this building. I think it would be a good idea if he went down again, because if he did he would learn a bit about what goes on. The gold industry is not totally exempt from tax. All the usual taxes are paid, except corporate tax. Shareholders pay full income tax on dividends arising out of goldmining profits. Other companies which pay corporate tax are able to pass on an imputation credit to shareholders who receive a corresponding credit against their income tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The integration method of taxation which is currently applied to the goldmining industry has the advantage-I am sorry to see that Senator McKiernan has left the chamber-that the undistributed profits are not taxed in the first instance. They are invariably applied towards further development and investment. More funds are therefore available from the internal company resources for the vital purposes of expanding an industry, putting money back from whence it has come. As we all know, encouragement of more investment in productive activities is absolutely essential for the future of Australia. Sometimes I wonder, sitting on this side of the chamber, whether the Government side has much interest in the productive resources of Australia. I have often made the point in this place that the Government is always slamming the people of rural Australia and not taking any interest in those vital export industries which give us all a decent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> When discussing this Bill, we must remember that without the existing positive tax regime the Australian goldmining industry would not have expanded to the extent to which it evidently has during the 1980s. It is well for everyone to know that for 40 years, from 1933 to 1972, government policy led to the price of gold being fixed. It is difficult to imagine what effect such a freeze would have on any other industry. What loss of income did the industry suffer in those years because the price for gold was fixed? I think that is very hard for us all to comprehend. The industry did not rip the Australian people off at that stage and it is not ripping them off now. </PARA>
<PARA> If a gold tax is introduced, the long term goldmining industry will be seriously jeopardised. Not only will new projects not proceed, but also the tax will result in the serious reduction of the life of many existing operations. In simple terms, it will take the icing off the cake. In fact, it will do more than that; it will destroy the cake itself. The industry now mines deep deposits and this is a costly operation. In addition to the much higher capital cost of mine development as a result of both underground mining and the treatment of the sulphide ores with the new mining techniques now in operation, the companies have to provide all the infrastructure of power, water, roads, housing and airstrips. They also sometimes provide schools and medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> If this industry is to continue in future, there will be higher capital costs. When the incentive is taken away, those companies will move offshore and that is not going to be good for Australia. Marginal mines will close and investment will stop. If that is being done by a government which says it has the interests of the Australian people at heart, I think that government stands damned. It is attempting to bleed yet another essential resource based industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The goldmining industry is not asking to be privileged through not paying tax. It is only arguing that the present system applying to goldmining, which encourages facilities to reinvest part of the profits in the industry, is in Australia's interests. It is in Australia's interests to expand this system. Therefore, the same encouragement for investment should be provided to all Australian industries. Sir Arvi Parbo, the head of some major companies and probably the greatest Australian at the moment, has suggested that incentive should be given not only to the goldmining industry, but to some of the other export oriented industries which produce wealth for our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly urge the Senate to take note of the concerns of the gold industry and heed the warnings about the possible outcome of the imposition of a gold tax in Australia. Some of the smaller mines will suffer greater damage than the larger ones. If this tax is introduced, there will be a quick mining of the marginal deposits, leaving considerable amounts still in the ground never to be mined. This tax, which Senator McKiernan said was a good thing for his State of Western Australia, is basically retrospective in that mines do not just spring up overnight. Every goldmine in Australia probably has an eight-year lead time. It is a retrospective tax because some of the people who started goldmining some six or seven years ago will now be hit with all the disadvantages of having a tax placed on their produce. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when our foreign debt is $120 billion and we have just had our worst ever monthly trade deficit, the Government wants to cut the legs out from under our gold exporting industry, which in 1987-88 earned our country $2.56 billion in export income. The present round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) demonstrates this Government's total lack of appreciation of the importance of our export based industries. We will have more to say about the GATT round in the next few days. The gold industry is a contributor to our export income; the third most important contributor behind wool and coal. This Government stands condemned for jeopardising yet another export industry by the mooted introduction of a tax on goldmining. </PARA>

One of the items in that gold exhibition is a lunula that was crafted in 1800 BC. At the moment there is also an exhibition of Macedonian gold and treasures showing in Melbourne. These things are priceless and irreplaceable and are evidence of the romantic history of gold, which is the history of the modern era. It is a romance that has been associated with wars and piracy. Men have even drowned because they would not take off their gold belts. It is a history of glory and perfidy and broken promises. This proposed gold industry tax also has a history of perfidy and broken promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For a long time I have been trying to find out just what is the value of an ounce of gold. Nobody seems to know. I have made extensive inquiries. It is no good saying that the price of gold can be measured only in American dollars, deutschmarks or Swiss francs, because those currencies fluctuate. But I think the value of gold does not alter and probably has not altered since it was first discovered. When the world moved onto the gold standard an ounce of gold was worth so much coal, so much steel, so much wheat and so much of many other commodities in order to give it a value. The amount of paper we have to pay for an ounce of gold fluctuates and can rarely be said to be the value of an ounce of gold. For example, when dictators finally bring their countries to ruin and have to flee they do not take the paper money; they take the gold or the pearls or the diamonds or the paintings, or something that has value. It is not the paper that is of value; it is the gold itself. At one stage the United States fixed the price of gold at $34 an ounce for many years. That was hailed as a great move to stabilise currencies in the world. It disadvantaged all the gold-producing countries in the world, one of which was Australia. For 30-odd years Australia might have got a lot more money for its gold than $34 an ounce. It was one of the most massive rip-offs in history. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a quintessential conundrum that has been exercising the minds of men for years; that is: who commits the greater crime, the man who robs a bank or the man who opens a bank? That conundrum has not yet been answered. There is an old fable that I would like to draw to the mind of the Government relating to the introduction of this gold industry tax. That is the fable of the man who killed the golden goose. That is precisely what the Government is doing with this tax. I was raised on a goldmine. I have worked underground. I have heard the cracks, screams and groans of rocks as they take up their sheer forces. I know that the underground mining people live with a fearsome threat over them all the time, as do their families. Occasionally terrible accidents happen, but they accept this as part of their life. They do everything they can to avoid tragedies occurring but it is a different and a hard life. Miners have to live where the lode is. They cannot live in cities by choice; gold is where they find it. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with all modern science, there is still no magic formula for finding gold; one has to get out and find it where one can. Mining men have been the front-row men in the development of any country. So it has been in Australia. We have a history of giving incentives for goldmining people to go out, because they have to face the harassment of distance, for a start, and the harassment of high costs for all the commodities that they require and the high costs of educating their children. They have to send their children away for education. They deserve the encouragement of a government and any incentive they can get. Most of these things have been taken off people. Now there is a threat of taxing the industry. There is an old adage that says, `Anything the Government wants less of, it taxes; anything it wants more of, it subsidises'. In this case it must want less gold because it is introducing a tax on gold. </PARA>

I might add that Queensland Labor senators are also supporting a tax on the gold industry. We have fledgling industries in Queensland that are trying to get off the ground but this tax is going to clip their wings. Why should the Government do this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this occasion I wish to speak on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988. In so doing I draw attention to the fact that this Bill is before us because, when the Government drafted its original legislation following the introduction of the Budget, it was unable to express its intention as it wished to do. The original Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1988, which was introduced on 23 August 1988, appeared deliberately not to tax plastic bags which are used for the wrapping of bread, and for the taking away of fruit and vegetables and which are used in supermarkets and in other retail outlets for taking goods away generally. The deliberate omission of dealing with that material signalled a message to industry at large and retailers in general that those particular items would be exempt from the 20 per cent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In introducing this amendment Bill in the other place the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), in his second reading speech, said that the Bill would ensure that goods used by retailers to wrap or secure goods for marketing are subject to tax at the rate of 20 per cent. It introduced a retrospective note. I note that my colleague Senator Michael Baume has foreshadowed an amendment which will be moved at the committee stage dealing specifically with this retrospective provision. The deliberate attempt by the Government to make this retrospective just highlights the ineptitude of it being unable correctly to draft its original legislation, which was, as I said, introduced on 23 August. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it is the latest example of it, and there are plenty of others to draw upon. It shows that either the Government is inept at drafting legislation or it has changed its mind somewhere along the way. Either way, it turns out that the provision is retrospective and as such is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several other things that are relevant in this overall context, but there are some things which flow directly from the imposition of this 20 per cent tax specifically on the plastic bag item that I have mentioned. It does in fact represent a quasi-tax on food and clothing, which have traditionally been tax exempt. It does mean, for instance, that a loaf of bread will have this tax imposed upon it, because we buy our bread in plastic bags. Through the imposition of the tax on a plastic bag, we are therefore in effect paying a tax on a loaf of bread. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to children's clothing and other items which have traditionally been subject to the emotional debate about our broad-based consumption taxes which this Government has said that it is opposed to. In fact what we are getting is a tax on such items by the back door. Slowly but surely the body of sales taxes, indirect taxes, is being built up on more and more goods and we are seeing a de facto introduction of a consumption based tax without consumers knowing precisely how much is involved and, indeed, without having an opportunity of seeing just how great is the rate of growth of this collection of sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the bags on which this tax is to be imposed are plastic bags used, for example, on a loaf of bread, the thin plastic bags used for taking fruit and vegetables from supermarkets, with which so many of us are familiar, the plastic bags that are used at the checkout counters in supermarkets, and of course, those used in other retail outlets as well. So the imposition of a tax on the plastic wrappings on all sorts of items which have been tax exempt has effectively meant that the goods are subject to a tax. Thereby of course, the legislation represents a considerable extra cost to the community and will impact on all retailers, whether large or small. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings to mind the general collection of sales tax, which has increased so greatly in the time that this Government has been in office. It is interesting to look at the published figures for the financial year 1986-87 dealing with the sale value of taxable goods included in returns by each class and business type. These figures show that in the year 1986-87 the total amount of sales was valued at approximately $33.2 billion, on which sales tax of $6.3 billion was collected. That means that we are paying an average of 20 per cent consumption tax, by whatever name one chooses to call it, on goods which are in fact taxable. When the argument about whether there should be a broad-based consumption tax has been entertained by various individuals, it has been on the basis that the rate of tax should be no larger than about 10 per cent. Yet the way in which this Government has implemented its growth of sales tax, which is about 147 per cent, has meant that we are paying an average of 19.14 per cent on all those classes of goods. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is. I would not like to call it a Clayton's consumption tax, but I would like to call it a de facto consumption tax because that is what we are seeing. As has already been pointed out in this debate, sales tax collections in this current year represent 10.4 per cent of all taxes collected. This is a growth over the period of six years since this Government came to office from the 1982-83 financial year percentage of 8.5. Each year there has been an increase in the amount of sales tax collected by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do seem to have a government which is obsessed with the collection of tax from whatever source it can get it and by whatever means. But the questions `What is tax collected for, where is the benefit to the community, and what is the purpose of raising the tax in terms of providing good government for the people' are not addressed by this Government. Since this Government came to office the total tax take has more than doubled. The last Fraser Government Budget had a tax take of about $40 billion. In this current year the tax take by this Government will be in excess of $80 billion. I ask the people whether they feel twice as well off. When I have gone into various parts of Sydney where families are struggling to make ends meet, I have not met anyone who has said, `I feel twice as well off because this Government is raking in twice the amount of tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I think this debate on sales tax has been highlighted by the Opposition is simply to alert the public to the fact that so much money is being paid by way of de facto consumption tax. While the Government says that it is not in favour of consumption taxes, it imposes them at a high and mighty rate. It is well for people to remember the figures. It is well to remember that of the 50 categories of business items on which sales tax is imposed-they include everything from motor cars to floor coverings, confectionery, stationery and other paper products, toys, games and novelties, jewellery, suitcases, photographs and cameras, musical instruments, canvas goods and ropes, and all manner of manufactured pet foods-every item affects the average family. But on those items we are all now paying nearly 20 per cent effective de facto consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is most important that Senator Michael Baume has foreshadowed the amendment which is aimed at getting rid of at least the retrospective part of this legislation. When we come to the committee stage I think more information will be laid before the Australian people so that they can realise how the Government is duping them; how it says, on the one hand, that it will not have a bar of a consumption tax, and how, on the other hand, it has introduced sales tax on so many items and that it will impinge even on the loaves of bread we buy. The hypocrisy will be laid for people to see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, which gives effect to measures announced in the May economic statement and, in particular, which removes certain tax exemptions currently available to the goldmining industry. Before I present the arguments in opposition to this legislation and to the announcements, I will support my case by referring to the arguments, not in terms of their depth but in terms of their force, that are being put by the Western Australian Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bother to do that because I was in the chamber some weeks ago when Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, responded to a dorothy dix question from Senator Beahan-Labor, Western Australia-asking Senator Walsh about the tax on gold, a tax which Senator Cook continues to describe as a corporate tax. I can only assume that Senator Cook talks about it as a corporate tax because he has not read section 23 (pa) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I recall that Senator Walsh in answering that question described those opposed to the legislation as `spivs who lounged around Perth'. I do not know whether the honourable senator was being selective in his description or whether it was all-embracing, but one is moved to observe that the Labor member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) subsequently spoke against the tax in the House of Representatives and crossed the floor against his Party, against his Caucus and against the legislation. I do not offer to Mr Campbell any altruistic motives. He had two choices: to confront his Caucus and risk censure and the unlikely but possible prospect of losing his endorsement, contrasted with the certainty of losing his seat. It was a question of losing his endorsement or losing his seat, and he knew that the prospect of losing his seat was far greater than the prospect of losing his endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA> So he made an expedient decision and voted against the Government. Do we judge him to be a spiv? Do we judge him to be a lazy layabout lounging about Perth? Or does he have some special dispensation? Has he got some exemption? Is he quarantined from the outrageous claims of Senator Walsh in respect of those who are opposed to the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The same might be asked of the Premier of Western Australia, who is desperately hanging on to the final threads of power. He is presently leading a failed Government about to be ignominiously dumped out of office in Western Australia in February next year. Is this man a spiv by definition? Is he a lazy person who lounges about Perth? It is worth noting his comments. In the State Parliament on 26 May this year Mr Dowding was highly critical of the Liberal Party. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am disappointed that the Liberal Party was not more supportive of the State Government and the goldmining industry's attack over the last five years on the attempt by the Federal Government to remove the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>He was being critical of the Western Australian Liberal Opposition for not being more aggressive in opposing a gold tax. He described the debate as:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a very serious and very important issue which the Leader of the Opposition should have had the strength of character to support fully, but he does not have that strength of character. </PARA>
<PARA>He was criticising the Liberal Party in Western Australia for not being more aggressive in its opposition. Mr Dowding was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 26 May 1988 to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a clear breach of faith with the Western Australian Government and the community and as far as I am concerned the fight is far from over. </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the May statement and the proposed tax on gold. He said that it was `a clear breach of faith'. In the West Australian of 16 May 1988 it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has enough revenue without seeking to raise a further $100m to $600m through a gold tax, according to the Premier, Mr Dowding. </PARA>
<PARA> `Federal revenues are up dramatically and I do not think there is a need to increase Federal revenues now', Mr Dowding said. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The gold industry was already paying a de facto income tax in the form of dividend imputation where shareholders in gold companies paid tax on their dividends. </PARA>
<PARA>As reported in the Daily News of 13 May, he said that the Western Australian Government maintained its opposition to any form of tax on gold. He was asked a question-a dorothy dixer no doubt-by Dr Gallop, one of his own backbenchers, in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. He asked the Premier:</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Premier restate the Government's position on gold tax? Can he say what support he might expect for the Government's stand on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier, Mr Dowding, responded in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government is and has been at all material times opposed to the removal of the tax-exempt status of gold. In order to advance the situation in a constructive way I have asked the Minister for Agriculture to reform the gold policy committee and to ask it to report to the Deputy Premier and myself as soon as practicable on what steps can be taken  in the face of the Federal Government's decision . . . </PARA>

They include the tax exemption for income from goldmining contained in section 23 (o) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. When speaking on the issue of the so-called gold tax exemption, two points, in my view, ought to be emphasised and reiterated. To begin with, the goldmining industry is an important earner of export dollars. By 1990, for example, gold is expected to overtake meat, iron ore, wheat and wool to become Australia's most valuable export earner after coal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is for the moment. In 1987 the value of Australian gold exports was $1,694m and increased growth in earnings is expected in the immediate future. Hence, the goldmining industry plays a vital role in correcting Australia's serious trade imbalance, as further evidenced by the recent worsening current account figures. In this regard, I refer honourable senators to the statement of the Treasurer, Mr Keating, on 16 December 1986. In announcing the continued taxation arrangements for the gold industry at that time, Mr Keating said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The importance of encouraging active exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the goldmining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's longstanding tax exemption. </PARA>

Of course there has been nothing-nothing except the greed of this Government for further revenue at any price. No longer is it making realistic economic judgments of what is good for an economy; all it wants to do is suck the system, soak up every single dollar of taxation it can find. It finds that the goldmining industry, and in this respect one of the few industries in Australia, through the free market forces and through a sensible taxation regime has been able to flourish, to expand and grow. So the first thing the Government says is, `Hey, here is an industry; let's suck this dry too'. One ought not to forget what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of this country said before the last election. He said, `There will be no tax on gold in the life of the next Parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>

Frankly, if the Government were feeling a little more secure, it would have broken that promise like every other promise it has broken and introduced a tax on gold. The problem is that that is one of the few promises the Government put in writing and signed, and it used it in the advertising during the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The promise is not broken, the promise is kept to the letter, not a day or a moment longer. The contract stands, but the logic of a tax on gold in 1991 is no different from a tax on gold in 1987, 1988 or 1989. The only thing is that the Government has made a commitment and so it is stretching out the starting date of the legislation to overcome that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We ought to look at the monthly current account disaster which this Hawke Government is inflicting upon the Australian people. For the first four months to October this year we have seen the deficit blow out to $5.4 billion, already slightly more than half the $9.5 billion figure predicted in the Budget for 1988-89. Furthermore, the statement that the gold industry does not pay taxes is an absolute myth; it is a fallacy which ought to be dispelled, but it is a fallacy which is perpetuated by the Labor Party in seeking to justify its present legislation. The only distinction is that the goldmining industry does not pay corporate tax, but it pays all the other usual taxes paid by all other companies. Unlike shareholders in companies in other industries, the shareholders of goldmining companies pay income tax at their marginal rates on dividends arising from goldmining profits. While companies in other industries do pay corporate tax, they are able to pass on franked dividends to shareholders who receive a corresponding imputation credit against their income tax liability. Shareholders in goldmining companies receive unfranked dividends which are therefore taxable at the shareholder's marginal rate. It ought to be remembered that the retained profits by goldmining companies manifest themselves in the aggregate price of the shares, so people wishing to enter the share market would be tempted to look at the goldmining industry, see the attractive incentive it has and buy its stock and up goes the price of the stock. As I say, that aggregates in the profits on which capital gains tax is paid at the marginal rate when the stock is sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic difference, therefore, between the gold industry's integration tax system and the normal imputation tax system is that, for gold companies, retained profits are not taxed initially. Additional dividends and capital gains resulting from re-invested retained earnings will, however, be taxed when they reach the shareholder. This simple distinguishing feature provides an environment conducive to the essential re-investment of profits and reduces the incentive for profits to flow to overseas shores where more favourable tax regimes are available. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued-it is not a debate I want to get into now-that corporate tax exemption in Australia is causing enormous profits to be repatriated out of Australia by overseas companies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is my view that because there is no corporate tax on gold in Australia this has caused the overseas corporations to re-invest in Australia. As long as the profits are re-invested in Australia, they are quarantined from the initial corporate tax. The moment they are repatriated overseas, they are then paying the tax level at the home rate. Once the Government introduces this tax regime, it will be just as economically logical for overseas corporations to repatriate the profits home, pay the profits at home and not pay them in Australia. At present they are encouraged to re-invest in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must be realised that the gold industry is still in a phase of recovery from the 39 years up to 1972 when the price of gold was fixed owing to the fact that it was a commodity which was used as a unit of currency. It ought to be remembered that the treatment of gold during this time caused the demise to a very large degree and the decline of many goldmining towns-I am more familiar with Western Australia than anywhere else-such as Reedy's, Agnew, Leonora, Cue, Meekatharra and Wiluna. These towns very much contracted and almost became ghost towns. During that same period we saw almost every goldmine on the Golden Mile close down. If it had not been for the fact that Western Mining Corporation Ltd found its nickel out of Kalgoorlie, Western Mining Corporation at that time was proposing to transfer all its operations into the metropolitan area. It is not without significance to note that when the Whitlam Government abolished the exemption for prospectors-the 23 (pa) to which I referred earlier-employment in the industry fell for every year during the period that the exemption had been removed. The exemption was reinstated by the then Treasurer, Phillip Lynch, quite properly in 1977 as a result of a commitment he made in the main street of Kalgoorlie, Hannan Street. Since that time the industry has again flourished. In the late 1970s under the free market--</PARA>

The Opposition is looking desperately to get some sort of scalp as a result of these particular matters, but I am afraid it will be disappointed. Senator Tambling continues to make the assertion in the latter part of his question that there has been a deliberate misleading of the Parliament in relation to the original answer given by Mr Hand, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in another place. I reject that completely, and indeed the answer given by the Minister in the other place on that initial occasion to Mr Shipton is accurate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Senator Jones is not asking me to comment on the respective merits or personal appeal of The Addams Family and Neighbours. Bearing that in mind I am aware of the reported activities of a delegation of actors, writers and producers calling themselves the Make it Australia Committee urging that the minimum requirement of 104 hours of first release Australian drama be increased to more than 300 hours. Commercial television programming standards and requirements are set by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT), which is the independent statutory authority that has responsibility in this area. The ABT is currently drawing to a close a major review of Australian content standards on commercial television. I am advised that the results of that review will be announced in 1989. The Government, as is well known, is presently reviewing the Broadcasting Act and the regulatory framework covering broadcasting in Australia. One of the issues under consideration is whether it would be appropriate to have a set of objectives for broadcasters laid out in the legislation to assist both the ABT and the public to assess the performance of our commercial broadcasters. One such objective could be along the lines that Australian programming be developed to the maximum extent possible. There are ways to achieve this other than through formally increasing the number of hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the provision of opportunities for Australian actors, which was a central theme of Senator Jones's question, the broadcasting legislation already requires licensees, as a condition of holding a licence, to undertake to use Australian creative resources. The Broadcasting Act already requires licensees, as a condition of holding their licences, to undertake to use Australian creative resources. Clearly, this is something that could be the subject, I think, of more enforcement attention in the future. In addition, the Government has finally provided $70m in the current financial year to establish the Australian Film Finance Corporation which will fund qualifying Australian production, both for film and for television, and that should also assist in meeting the objectives to which Senator Jones has correctly drawn our attention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, through Ministers in this place, has misled the Senate as to his knowledge of the report by Arthur Andersen into the activities of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. The fact that there may have been some reference to that audit being undertaken does not necessarily mean that the Minister had a fully informed mind in relation to those matters which were the subject of the auditor's report. I have here a document from Mr McDonald dated 8 September 1988 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>in my brief to you for your meeting with NAIHO on 31 August (part copy attached) I referred to an audit of the organisation conducted by accountants Arthur Andersen and Co. in 1986.

As I have said, I believe that there is a recognition there that, whatever might have been attached to a note in earlier correspondence, it was recognised that the Minister's coming into the portfolio required that he be informed and given a copy of this report so that he could then take it into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I responded on behalf of the Government to the Steel Industry Authority recommendations relating to the steel plan this morning. Lest I be accused of government by press release I should indicate to the Senate the essence of that response-to the Steel Industry Authority report and to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, chaired by Mr Martin. The Government has decided that the steel plan will end on 31 December 1988. No further bounties will be paid on the production of steel. Tariff protection will continue at low to moderate levels-that is, nought to 14 per cent cent-phasing down to 10 per cent as the maximum level. Developing country preferences will be reintroduced for all steel products and countries. There will be no special provision in regard to by-law entry of steel products. No changes will be made to the trade practices legislation. However, the Government will consider action in future if it proves to be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the Government supports the process of negotiating agreements at plant level between the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and the unions. These plant level agreements which are expected to be finalised shortly will cover matters such as productivity targets, employment security, training and work practices. That means that, as from 31 December, the Government will have no direct involvement in the steel industry at all apart from some monitoring of aggregate statistics relating to imports, exports, productivity and so on. I should just report that at present BHP is producing at maximum capacity, to satisfy both export markets and a strong growth in domestic demand for steel. The current level of productivity measurement per employee is between 320 and 350 tonnes per man-a figure which compares with 180 tonnes per man in 1983 when the steel industry plan started. During the period of the plan, BHP has invested $1.5 billion and has foreshadowed further investments. That is in response to a commitment to invest $800m. Employment in the industry has stabilised. During the life of the plan the Government expended $146m on bounty or subsidy assistance as against $350m which was announced at the time of the plan as the maximum level which the Government would be prepared to spend.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) been downgraded from a department to a section? Has its staff been cut from 40 to 20, and are many of those staff part time? Has a ceiling been imposed on the number of staff members in the Foreign Investment Review Board? Furthermore, can the Minister confirm that only one prosecution has occurred under the Foreign Takeovers Act since it was enacted by the Fraser Government in 1976, and that this prosecution was unsuccessful? In view of the massive and increasing volume of foreign investment buying up our primary and tourism industries, rural and urban businesses and properties, when does the Government intend to upgrade the FIRB, increase its staff and equip it to protect Australia from being sold off to foreign investors at bargain basement prices, or even at highly inflated prices as seems to have happened in the residential market?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the last part of the question, I would have thought that, if bits of Australia had been sold off at highly inflated prices, that is, at prices well above their long-term value, that was a bit of good business. A number of assumptions and presumptions in the question are incorrect. Firstly, there has been no change to the Foreign Investment Review Board for a number of years. Secondly, the Treasury support staff for the FIRB was changed from a division to a branch some time last year. At the time the Government announced in September 1977 that it would monitor more closely, or tighten up on, the purchase of residential real estate in Australia, the number of staff was 15. The number has recently been increased to 20. Of course, there is a ceiling on staff numbers, as there is in all comparable bodies in government, with the recent exception that agencies have been allowed within the last 12 months to substitute a limited amount of money for staff-in other words, to vary the average staffing level by up to half a per cent provided it is done within the financial limits set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Foreign Takeovers Act, the parent Act, was passed not by the Fraser Government in 1976, but by the Whitlam Government in 1975. Bits of Australia are not being sold at bargain basement prices. More important than those small mistaken assumptions in the question is the fact that Senator Haines and the Australian Democrats do not like foreign borrowings and they do not like foreigners taking equity in Australia. I suppose that they are defensible enough positions in themselves. But the fact is that, while we continue to run a current account deficit-and I have not heard many propositions ever come from the Australian Democrats that would do anything but make the current account deficit worse-we can make a choice between increasing borrowings abroad and increasing foreign ownership of Australian equity. There is no alternative. It has to be one or the other, unless we can get rid of the current account deficit altogether. If there were some painless way of doing that, I am sure we would have done it, and I am sure the previous Government would have too.</PARA>

My question of the Minister therefore is: Were other measures not available to the Australian Government to ensure that the Yugoslav authorities yielded up the officer concerned for appropriate investigation and trial in Australia?

Those pleasantries aside, the truth is that, so long as the consulate remained a consulate, it was physically inviolable by the Australian Government or anyone else, even though the person concerned may not at any stage have been able to enjoy or claim formal diplomatic or consular immunity. But the premises remained inviolable and to that extent there was a degree of de facto immunity thus associated with the situation until the time that the consulate premises were closed. Once the premises were closed, and the functions of the consul thus terminated, the situation arose where the Australian Government was then bound by the terms of the Vienna Convention to give safe passage out of the country to the people whose functions were thus terminated. That is the construction of that article that has by and large been accepted and certainly, as I said yesterday, that is the textbook construction of it, creating an obligation even for someone in gaol legitimately on an offence to be escorted safely out of the country. That was the conundrum that we faced.</PARA></TALK.START>

The ground of the objection was never put in those terms to me directly or in communications between my Department and the Ambassador or to our people in Belgrade. It was put simply in terms that they believe themselves entitled to be offended at the so-called absence of protection from the demonstration. They believe the officer on their side was justified in reacting as he did. We even had the extradordinary statement from the Yugoslav Foreign Minister yesterday that it was an occasion for pride and satisfaction for the Yugoslav people that the personnel at the consulate reacted as they did. That was the nature of their response. They believed under those circumstances that the reaction of the Australian Government in closing the consulate and in expelling the whole staff was not justified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see the 7.30 Report last night, but I am told that Mr Howard made the statement that Senator Colston said he did. It is obvious-and this is the charitable view-that Mr Howard is looking back at 1982-83 through rose-tinted spectacles. It is true that some families were better off in 1982 and 1983 because they had just had a two-year wages explosion where nominal wages went up by 13 per cent in 1981 and by 14 per cent in 1982. So for those people who kept their jobs there had been a large increase in real income, which is not the same thing, necessarily, as average living standards or average per capita income; but there had been a substantial increase in real income for those people who were able to keep their jobs. That category excludes the 209,000 who lost their jobs in the last 15 months of the Fraser-Howard regime. In making the statement that he did, Mr Howard has also chosen to ignore the more than 1.1 million people who have obtained jobs since this Government has been in office. In other words, in the last year of the Fraser-Howard regime, 200,000 people a year were losing their jobs. Since this Government has been in office an extra 200,000 people, coincidentally, have been getting jobs. The numbers are about the same: one has a negative sign in front of it and the other has a plus sign in front of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The unemployment rate in the March quarter of 1983 was 10.4 per cent. Inflation peaked at above 11 per cent.

It was designed to help the Fraser Government to fall over the line in another election-but that did not happen. What we had at that time was the big treble: double-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation, and a $10 billion Budget deficit looming, as Senator Stone was kind enough to tell us, on or about 6 March 1983. As I said before, that followed the wages explosion in 1981 and 1982 of 13 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.</PARA>

Apparently, the Queensland National Party was running two separate accounts: one for the proceeds of blackmail which went to the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation; and the other for brown paper bags which went into Kaldeal Pty Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it should be noted for the record that several of my colleagues sitting behind me were asking Senator Boswell whether he was the bagman. Neither the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation nor Kaldeal Pty Ltd is likely to be classified as a public benevolent institution, which is the relevant definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act for donations-if one could use that term-to be claimed by the giver as a deduction from the giver's taxable income. Those payments would seem to have been in the nature of voluntary payments or gifts, about which the Master Tax Guide on page 309 notes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The test of the assessability of a voluntary payment or gift is whether, from the recipient's point of view, it accrues to him by virtue of his office or employment, i.e. as additional remuneration in relation to services rendered. The motive of the donor and the periodicity of recurrence of the payment are relevant but not decisive factors. Ex gratia payments for honorary services, unsolicited donations received by an evangelist, an award received as best and fairest footballer, and instalments of a signing-on fee paid to an amateur footballer on joining a professional team have all been held to be assessable.</PARA>

I notice that Senator Stone is not trying to defend the Queensland National Party; Senator Brownhill is not trying to defend it; not even Senator Bjelke-Petersen is trying to defend it-just Senator Puplick. Senator Puplick is trying to lay a trail of smoke to hide the record of infamy of the Queensland National Party. As I was saying when quoting from the Master Tax Guide:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The fact that such transactions may be carried out by a third party does not appear to affect the tax liability associated with that kind of activity. Although, if some of the money stuck to the fingers of the third party, that would probably be different. As I said in response to Senator Schacht's question last week, it will be up to the Commissioner of Taxation, or his deputy, to make that final decision about these matters. I daresay, as I understand section 16 of the Act, the precise judgments made about that issue will never actually be disclosed. On the broader question of this transaction, I remind the Senate of Paddy Crick, as quoted by Cyril Pearl in Wild Men of Sydney. Paddy said:</PARA>
<PARA>If a person came to me and offered me 10,000 pounds to put through a matter for him, and I could put it through in a legitimate and honest way . . . I would take the amount, just as a barrister would take a 5,000 pound fee.</PARA>

Does the Minister agree, in comparing a note made on 2 December with a note made on 3 December, that Mr McDonald, when he was called to the telephone on 2 December, was engaged in departmental activities? Further, did Mr McDonald have no warning of the fact that he was about to be asked by his Minister a very serious question relating to an answer which the Minister had given in the Parliament that day? I ask whether the Minister agrees that Mr McDonald has subsequently explained the reply he gave on the telephone that day by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Does the Minister accept these explanations by Mr McDonald as to the reason why he was able to say on 2 December that he thought this answer might have been consistent with his recollection but that subsequently on 3 December, when he had been able to refresh his memory, he was able to give a more accurate response as to what had occurred in his note on 1 December and his recollection of the events of 31 August?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 December Senator Lewis asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications about a radio licence for the University of New South Wales. I seek leave to incorporate the text of that answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>There were a number of reasons why the Department of Transport and Communications could not renew the licence held by the University of NSW, notwithstanding the fact that the University proposed to use the licence for a very worthwhile purpose-educational broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the licence, issued under the Radiocommunications Act, was first granted some 20 years ago. However, the university now proposes to use the licence for a somewhat different purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> Originally, the licence was to operate a transmitter to distribute educational programs to particular lecture sites off the campus. The programs were sent on UHF channel 48 (changed to channel 43 in 1980) and, at that time, UHF reception was not generally available to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA> This is an important point because a licence issued under the Radiocommunications Act cannot be used for providing a service to the general public. It is not meant as a substitute for a licence issued under the Broadcasting Act. A Broadcasting Act licence can only be granted by the Broadcasting Tribunal through the public inquiry process. Educational broadcasting is part of public broadcasting and there are already a number of educational public radio services licensed under the Broadcasting Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1979, the university has been advised by the Department on several occasions of the requirement to seek a Broadcasting Act licence if it wished to proceed with an educational broadcasting service. I am advised that the University has not in fact used its former licence for the past 5 years, except for the occasional conference such as the recent ANZAS conference.</PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that, at this stage, there is no firm commitment to Public Television, a situation known to the University. However, in March of this year, I, as Minister for Transport and Communications, allowed, for the first time, test transmissions to be conducted by Public Television groups, to enable such groups to show their wares, raise support and undertake research into community attitudes and support for Public Television.</PARA>
<PARA> I also said that before the Government could seriously consider giving the go-ahead for Public Television in some permanent form, a much clearer picture was needed of what Public Television groups were proposing and a reasonably convincing case of its viability without relying on Commonwealth funds or advertising. I understand that neither Mr Willis nor Mr Dawkins has received any detailed proposals on public or educational television.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government will also consider the question of Public Television in conjunction with other reviews currently taking place-National Broadcasting Review and Pay Television. It is important to ensure that if Public Television is introduced in some permanent form, it be done so after careful consideration of all possible options. There will also need to be full consultation with a range of interested parties, including public and educational television groups, the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia and, in respect of educational television, the Minister for Education, Employment and Training.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 December Senator Jenkins asked me a question concerning a uranium pilot plant at Kalgoorlie. At that time I gave her a general answer but I was short on specifics. I can now give some detail. I understand that the construction of the pilot plant commenced on October 1979 and was completed in September 1980. Testing of uranium ore from the Yeelirrie uranium deposit was undertaken until December 1981, when the work was completed. Since then the pilot plant has been used intermittently for short periods as a general metallurgical test plant, mainly carrying out grinding tests on a variety of ores for third parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Approximately 170 road trains transported a total of 10,000 tonnes of ore from Yeelirrie to the pilot plant during 1980 and 1981. A shipment of 200 tonnes of ore from the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia was transported by road to the pilot plant for grinding test work in 1984. Olympic Dam ore contains copper, uranium, silver and gold. In each case, the ore was transported in accordance with the code of practice for safe transport of radioactive substances and I understand that both Western Australian and South Australian government authorities were notified as appropriate prior to shipment.</PARA>
<PARA> The yellowcake produced at the Western Mining Corporation Ltd pilot plant is stored in drums at the Lucas Heights establishment of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. However, I understand that in 1982 the then Commonwealth Government approved exports of small yellowcake samples, totalling around six kilograms each, to a number of uranium converters in Europe and the United States for analysis.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a deal of material to table for the benefit of honourable senators in relation to questions and matters to do with the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. On 28 November 1988, Senator Crichton-Browne asked, firstly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>How many unacquitted grants does the Department of Aboriginal Affairs have outstanding nationally?</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that as at 5 December 1988, 1,462 grants made by the Department had not been formally acquitted. Secondly, the honourable senator asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What are the numbers for each State?</PARA>
<PARA>The numbers for each State are as follows: New South Wales, 382; Queensland, 254; Victoria and Tasmania, 16; South Australia, 175; Western Australia, 444; and Northern Territory, 191. This makes a total of 1,462. Thirdly, the honourable senator asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Government doing about these unacquitted grants?</PARA>
<PARA>It has been normal departmental practice each year to focus on the acquittal of grants made in the previous financial year when audited financial statements became available from auditors, which is usually in the following November-December. However, in 1988 the situation has been different and, with the prospect of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission commencing on 1 January 1989, the State directors of the Department were instructed to give particular attention to the acquittal of grants with a view to minimising any carryover into ATSIC administration. Desirably, the target number should be zero but, because of the operational and ongoing process associated with the making of grants and the release of funds, such a result is just not practical.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, Senator Crichton-Browne asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Why have they occurred?</PARA>
<PARA>The funding process involves, firstly, the approval of a grant for a defined purpose. The purpose may be of an ongoing nature or for a one-off situation. Secondly, the approval is conditional on the grant recipient providing accountability for the use of the funds in outcome as well as financial terms. Thirdly, for an ongoing organisation, financial accountability is required on a quarterly basis culminating in the provision of the organisation's audited annual financial statements. Fourthly, an organisation's audited annual financial statements do not usually become available until around November-December. The Department's financial rules are therefore framed to require the receipt of these statements by the end of the second quarter of the financial year. Fifthly, with most grants acquittal must await the provision of the audited annual financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, two procedural factors are inherent in the process and are likely to delay acquittals. In the first place, the non-receipt of audited statements is particularly critical in remote areas where auditors are few in number and other matters are often given greater priority. In the second place, deficiencies in the audit report can range from qualifications of a serious nature to technical inconsistencies. These deficiencies are more frequently of a minor nature but still require administrative effort to resolve before an acquittal can be formally made. It is the latter problem which is largely responsible for the present level of unacquitted grants in a present staffing situation where resources are scarce and often overstressed. Seventhly, a third factor is the level of expertise in financial management and accounting in the grant recipient organisation. This matter is being addressed through training and on the job experience. Under the Aboriginal employment development policy, a special program has been established to provide training for Aboriginal organisations, directors and staff.</PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, Senator Crichton-Browne asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Are the departmental officers sufficiently skilled to deal with the matters?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is yes. Sixthly, the honourable senator asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Department enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is yes. Seventhly, he asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are grants still being made to organisations who presently have unacquitted grants?</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, but only after careful consideration of all the circumstances by the Department's State directors. It should be noted that many organisations are meeting the urgent needs of and services to their communities. Accordingly, State directors may, under delegation, make provision to continue funding to an organisation ending the formal acquittal of a grant or grants made previously.</PARA>

<PARA>The answers provided today by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) are in total conflict with the answer that he provided through his advisers last week during the Committee of the Whole stage of the Appropriation Bills. The Minister told the Committee that the acquittal of grants was an ongoing process and that I should not expect to find any variations in the numbers on an annual basis other than the variations on a month by month basis. Clearly, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has made a conscious effort since the matter of Mr Perkins was raised and since I raised the question of the number of unacquitted grants. Something like 400 grants have been acquitted in the last six weeks from Western Australia alone and there are somewhere between 600 and 700 grants in Australia as a whole. Clearly there has been a panic in the Department in the last few weeks, seeking to put right the wrong and the incompetence and the failings of the Department in the past. I conclude by saying that I can find no justification for the Department to continue to fund organisations that already have unacquitted grants outstanding. It clearly demonstrates an incompetence and a failure to account fully for the taxpayers' funds. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Tate tabled Minute 5851 . . . last Thursday. The purpose of tabling it was to show the Minister's annotation on it. The attachments to the document were tabled by Senator Bolkus yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, Senator Boswell asked: Why was Don McDonald not present at the 31 August meeting? The answer states:</PARA>
<PARA>This was not the first occasion on which the Minister has conducted meetings without Departmental officers present; however, in this case NAIHO requested a private meeting due to Mr McDonald's longstanding opposition to that organisation. Mr McDonald fully briefed the Minister before the meeting and was available on standby throughout it.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tambling asked the following questions: Is it true that the 8 November meeting was held only after the Shipton question? Secondly, were minutes produced only after the matter was raised again on 1 December. Thirdly, when and where was the 8 November meeting held? Fourthly, did anyone contact Don McDonald on 1 December to discuss the Shipton question? The answer states:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) and (ii) already dealt with by Senator Bolkus in Question Time; (iii) was covered in the statement from Mr Hand; (iv) Mr Hand's Senior Private Secretary, Mr Geoff Pryor phoned Mr McDonald on 1 December to ask him whether he had written the note expected as a result of the November 8 telephone conversation.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McDonald said that he had not; Mr Pryor did not pursue the matter further.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague asked this question: Has the private secretary to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs responded to Mr McDonald's 22 September note asking for advice as to any decision to resume funding to NAIHO? If not, why not? The answer states:</PARA>
<PARA>No, because a decision is yet to be made.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Watson asked: Is there any record of the 8 November meeting other than the 1 December record? The answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently Senator Chaney, in a speech on the motion to take note of the papers tabled, foreshadowed two other questions. The first concerned Glenda Humes's note for file of 18 October. Apparently the question asked: Does the quotation attributed to Harriett Swift-some concern about funding for staff positions-indicate that a decision had been taken, that it was only the amount that needed clarification? Another question arose out of Senator Chaney's speech on the motion to take note of the tabled papers: Do the minutes of 1 September, 15 September, 22 September and 13 October this year and the NAIHO letter of 1 September likewise indicate that a decision had been taken, that only the details of the actual amount needed clarification? The answer to those questions states:</PARA>
<PARA> the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has never attempted to conceal the fact that he was moving towards funding a national representative body in Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this was made clear in his original answer of November 8 to Mr Shipton and has been reiterated on several occasions since.</PARA>
<PARA> The meeting with representatives of NAIHO held on August 31 took him one step further in that process.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that some detailed consideration of the proposed NAIHO budget (of the kind referred to by Ms Swift in her conversation with Miss Humes) took place both before and after the August 31 meeting as part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of the 31 August meeting fell far short however, of a Ministerial decision to resume funding.</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr McDonald had been convinced that a resumption of funding had been directed by the Minister, it was his job to prepare a letter of offer and other formalities. He did not do so for the simple reason that he never received the necessary instruction to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that funding for NAIHO has not recommenced. This will only occur if and when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs approves of such a proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> His answer to Mr Shipton remains correct, and indeed, before proceeding to his subsequent supplementary statement in the House on November 8, Mr Hand checked with senior officers, including Mr McDonald, to ensure that they had no doubt about the accuracy of his statement. Had any senior officer, including Mr McDonald, had any doubts about the Minister's reply to Mr Shipton, they were explicitly invited to tell him on that day. The fact is that none, including Mr McDonald, stated any doubts.</PARA>

Mr Bailey does, however, agree with Mr Adams, Q.C. that payments made to Tranby College by the Aboriginal Development Commission for the establishment of a Secretariat, can be made pursuant to s. 26 (a) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980, as expenses of the Commission (in lieu of grants to Tranby College) in accordance with the Commission's powers as specified in s. 9 of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC officer who informed you of this information on Thursday evening, 1 December 1988, was under the misunderstanding that Mr Bailey had agreed with the entirety of Mr Adams' opinion.</PARA>
<PARA> I regret this misunderstanding and I hope that you appreciate that it was innocently made.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Cedric Wyatt</PARA>
<PARA>5 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>I offered to provide senators with the legal opinion being argued about. I now table the following documents:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A copy of a minute and attachments dated 27 October 1988 from Mr B. Bailey to Mr M. Stewart.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. A copy of a minute dated 28 October 1988 from Mr B. Bailey to the Regional Manager of the ADC in Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Prime Minister to dismiss the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of his misleading of Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation and the subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted public service procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the time to discuss the appalling fraud that this Government represents on the Aboriginal people of Australia, the lies that it has told them, the way it has brought them into disrepute in the community, with its national land rights and its treaty and all the other nonsense that has distracted it from the orderly administration of government programs. This is not the time to talk about the incompetence of the Ministers who have represented Minister Hand in this place, lawyers both who have brought into this Parliament documents which are, on their faces, inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there is a great deal that we will not have time to encompass in this debate but the point we wish to deal with today is the simple fact that Parliament has been successively misled both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, on the latest occasion only yesterday in this place. We have seen the subsequent attempts of the Government to cover this up, to lay a smokescreen, to muddy the waters and to distort and pervert the procedures of government. We are raising a matter which goes to the integrity of government and the integrity of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The question is: Will Mr Hawke impose any sorts of standards at all upon his Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), or will he allow this mess to continue to roll on without any concern being shown on his part? We need look no further back than to the events in the Senate of yesterday if we want to see the clearest possible example of the Senate being misled by a man who is legally qualified and who, in the space of a few minutes, put down a statement on behalf of Minister Hand that was inconsistent with the documents that he himself had tabled on the same day in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to labour the point, but the simple facts are that this Minister, who is now leaving, Minister Bolkus, came in here and made a statement on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, a statement which said that the first the Minister knew of the Arthur Andersen and Co. report on the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) was when he got a minute from Mr McDonald on 8 September. Yet the Minister himself produced attachments I and II to the document that was given to the Minister, a document which has been initialled by the Minister and marked for detailed treatment by Mr McDonald, on the day of his meeting with NAIHO. The Minister himself brought in attachments I and II, which make it quite clear that the Minister's attention was drawn, in both of those attachments, to the existence of the Arthur Andersen report. So on the simple statement of the Minister yesterday, that was the first that he had heard of this report. Since this is so important, let me quote his actual words:</PARA>
<PARA>This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>This is simply one of the more recent examples of this Parliament being misled. We have another document which we believe to be the original briefing note given to the Minister, which makes it clear that when he first became Minister in 1987, these matters were drawn to his attention. It will be interesting to see whether Minister Tate produces that document on behalf of the Government, perhaps tomorrow, long after this debate is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole sorry episode shows a determination to mislead this Parliament that is akin to when we raised matters with respect to the Estimates Committee. We had the hurried telephone conference after the questions were raised in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Why does the Government deal with these delicate matters by telephone? Why does it demand from a senior officer over the telephone his statement as to whether the Minister's answer was accurate. What a nonsensical way to proceed. No lawyer dealing with a matter of such importance would behave in that way. It would be a quite extraordinary and pathetically unprofessional approach adopted by the Government, if it were not simply a dishonest one. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two legs to this Opposition motion. The first is that the Parliament has been misled, and the second is that there has been an attempted falsification of the record, a breach of Public Service procedures. I will not have time to deal with all of those matters, but the other speakers on behalf of the Opposition, Senator Stone and Senator Short, are people who have served in the Public Service, who are aware of the procedures and who, from their dealings with Ministers, are aware of the nonsense that this Minister speaks. On radio this morning he suggested that a decision is made by a Minister only when something is signed. What absolute nonsense! How often do people see Ministers and obtain decisions as was the case in this particular instance, as evidenced by all the documents which were available until the time that this matter was raised in the Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to get the sequence right and to look at the contemporaneous, as against the subsequently constructed, records. We know that NAIHO was a discredited organisation. We have the independent auditor's report which was tabled just a few days ago and which was drawn to the Minister's attention, when he first became Minister. We know, because the Government has told us, that it was drawn to his attention before he had the meeting with NAIHO at the end of August this year. We know that NAIHO sought renewed funding, and in February 1988 Minister Hand wrote that he was not prepared to agree at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quickly point out to the Senate that that is another example of misrepresentation, of the misleading of this Parliament, as recently as yesterday. We find a clear misstatement by Minister Hand, in the statement made by Minister Bolkus yesterday, as to what he was requiring of NAIHO. He says there was a requirement of restructuring. That is clearly not what was required by the Minister in the letter which was tabled earlier in this place. Again, it is just another example of misleading. There are so many that it is hardly worth pausing on any one of them. We know-there is no dispute over the fact-that Minister Hand met with NAIHO on 31 August 1988 and we know that he was briefed by his Department, given a clear statement of the problems and advised to raise points for evaluation. The Minister was clearly advised by his Department not to agree to funding. He was clearly advised by his Department that points should be raised for evaluation. It was not expected that the Minister would make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may leap ahead to some of the later material put on paper by Mr McDonald, I remind the Senate that in his memorandum of 3 December Mr McDonald made it clear that in the conversation he had with the Minister, the Minister made it clear that he had not expected Mr McDonald to agree with the decision to fund NAIHO. Mr McDonald's response, obviously, was blunt. It all fits together. There is very little that can be suggested is out of place with the reality as it can be clearly demonstrated on the uncontested documents before us. We know that Mr McDonald was, according to the brief, to attend this meeting. It is clear, on the face of the document, that Mr McDonald was to attend. We are not in possession of information as to why the Minister did not have him at the meeting. It is common ground, however, that it was the Minister who spoke to Mr McDonald after the meeting. Indeed, he marked the memorandum back to the Department with these words, `Refer details of meeting to D. McDonald as soon as possible' and it was initialled by the Minister on the date of the meeting. We know that a conversation took place and we have Mr McDonald's account of that conversation. We have, of course, a very valuable piece of external evidence from the organisation concerned, an organisation which has had long experience of dealing with governments. On the very same day as Mr McDonald committed his record of the discussion with the Minister to paper, NAIHO wrote to Mr Hand and said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Gerry,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to follow on from the discussions of yesterday relating to the funding of NAIHO. In undertaking the fine tuning of the agreement reached yesterday, I would ask that we consider the following points. </PARA>
<PARA>Then follow points which are utterly consistent with the other documentation which is available to us. The points raised go to the detail of how much and precisely what activities would be funded. There is no suggestion that there is any doubt about the matter of whether or not funding would occur. Indeed, the letter, in its penultimate paragraph, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind the Budget position as discussed, we would seek your agreement to a small increase in the indicative figure of $193,000 of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McDonald's minute, which has caused a great deal of comment and has had a lot of attention in this place over recent days, was of the same date, 1 September, and part of that minute reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the meeting the Minister informed me that he had approved funding of about $180,000 for NAIHO with effect from 1 December. He would confirm this with a written advice to the Department. In response to a question from me, the Minister agreed that points 1 and 2 and attachment II of the attached brief were an appropriate description of NAIHO's role for the purpose of the letter of offer. </PARA>
<PARA>The importance of that is that one can see that there was discussion about the detail of what was to go into this agreement on the part of the Minister in his discussions with Mr McDonald. Therefore, both the organisation itself and the public servant who is dealing with the matter are making it quite clear that they see an agreement as having been concluded, the public servant on the basis of the advice which he has been given by the Minister himself and the organisation on the basis of the conclusion of the quite separate discussion-a point worth making and, indeed, Senator Austin Lewis made the point to me this morning-held with the Minister without the presence of Mr McDonald. The same conclusion was reached by Mr McDonald on the basis of his quite separate discussions with the Minister after that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to deal quite briefly with the fact that there then follows a succession of internal minutes or memoranda within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, all of which confirm the existence of an agreement and the fact that there is no more than a discussion on detail and quantum. The one minute which has been seriously challenged is that of the senior officers meeting. That challenge needs to be dealt with because it has been used to cast doubt over the general proposition that the Minister's statement in the House of Representatives that he had not agreed to funding was in error. What Mr McDonald said in his memorandum of 3 December was this:</PARA>
<PARA>The minutes of the Senior Officers' meeting . . . are partly in error. My recollection is that I reported that the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO. There was some comment from several other officers, including a question about the cost of this decision. I believe that I estimated the cost would be `about $180,000' but do not agree that I said that the Minister had `directed that NAIHO receive $180,000'. As you know, the . . . minutes are a much edited version of proceedings and should not be regarded as anything like a verbatim record. </PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr McDonald's explanation of the correction about which so much has been made by the Government. With respect to the further memoranda, I remind the Senate of the note that Mr McDonald put forward on 15 September saying that the Minister's office was to refer details of the meeting to D. McDonald as soon as possible-`They are not here; could they be chased up, please?' There is the note from Mr Pryor-`Geoff somebody says that you were the only official present at the meeting'. There is no challenge to McDonald there or at any later time until the matter was raised in the Parliament. McDonald followed that up with a more formal note on 22 September pointing out that he had not received the details and that until he had received that he would not be in a position to process funding action. Notice again that this is purely a communication on the question of process. </PARA>
<PARA> Again on 3 October we find Mr McDonald saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I raised the issue of NAIHO funding with Ms Swift and Andrew Jackomos . . . they still had one aspect to sort out. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is no suggestion that there was anything other than a commitment to funding. Again, we find the same thing in the memorandum which has been made available from Glenda Humes, who says that she raised the question of NAIHO funding again with Harriett Swift, who apologised for the delay in sending the Department relevant information concerning the funding. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is some concern about the precise amount needed and that 2 staff positions (. . . funded by DEET) needed to be sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems pretty clear from these minutes that the Department is proceeding on the basis of funding having been approved and the detail still being a matter for discussion and agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> We then get to what happened in Parliament itself. The Minister was asked, in a series of questions by Mr Shipton, this question:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Minister recommenced funding to that organisation; and if so, on what grounds?</PARA>
<PARA>In what was a very loose answer-that is the expression that was used by Mr McDonald-the Minister said this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have met with representatives of that body and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. I am yet to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition does not rely only on the inaccuracy of that particular statement. As I said earlier in the debate, it is quite clear that in the statement made by the Minister, through the mouth of Senator Bolkus only yesterday-a statement that was in writing and from the Minister's office-there have been other misrepresentations to this Parliament. One of the key points made by the Opposition is that that statement is simply not in accord with the facts as they are described in great detail by Mr McDonald in his memorandum of 3 December. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the water has been muddied by the extraordinary minute of 1 December, which purports to be a record of a telephone conversation which took place on 8 November. Much has been made of that minute in defence of the Minister. I can only say that it is an extraordinary procedure that when a matter has been raised in the Parliament and dealt with by telephone conference we have a situation where nothing is committed to writing-or nothing committed to writing has been shown to the Opposition-until 1 December when the matter was further raised in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. It was not until Senator Tambling had raised this matter again in the Senate that this three-week-old note was put down. We find it contains the interesting proposition that Mr McDonald agreed to provide a minute confirming the telephone conversation of 8 November. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask those people who are seeking to make a judgment on these papers to mark the attention that Mr McDonald gave to the follow-up of his discussion with the Minister of 31 August-a discussion which involved Mr McDonald getting what, I am told, was the unwelcome news for the Department that the Minister was to fund NAIHO. We find Mr McDonald consistently putting in writing his concerns at the lack of follow-up to that conversation and that decision. We find nothing after the allegation from the senior officers that Mr McDonald had been asked to provide a minute. We now have Mr McDonald's own explanation for that. He says that he was not asked to do that. I simply ask those senators who have to make a decision on this: Is it not extraordinary that he was so conscientious in committing things to paper before 8 November and so slack-if we are to believe that that request was made-in failing to do so after 8 November?</PARA>
<PARA> We find this to be a very peculiar minute which focuses only on the record of the senior officers meeting of 5 September and says that Mr McDonald and the Minister were in agreement that the senior officers' minutes were not correct. We now have Mr McDonald's explanation to the extent to which he says those senior officers' minutes are not correct. That is a matter which in no way relieves Mr Hand from responsibility for misleading the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the minute of 2 December, which Mr McDonald provided in response to a request from the Secretary, Mr McDonald said-and the Senate will recall that this was over the telephone:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister read . . . the text of an answer he had given earlier that day to a question about his `decision' to fund NAIHO. I confirmed that the answer was accurate and consistent with my recollection of his advice to me after his meeting with NAIHO some weeks earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>That sits oddly with the suggestion that the Minister misled the House on that particular occasion. However, we again have Mr McDonald's own explanation for that. On 3 December Mr McDonald stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree that I accepted that the Minister had not approved funding to NAIHO. I have never had any doubt that he had agreed to fund it. As I indicated in my note to you of 2 December, I agreed in our conversation that the Minister's answer was `consistent' with my recollection of the 31 August meeting. I thought then, and still do, that the answer the Minister gave in the House was loose enough to be `consistent', particularly in view of the possibility of DEET funding and the doubts which had probably been raised in the Minister's mind by the audit report. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude this segment of the debate by simply reminding the Senate that in this memorandum Mr McDonald asserts not once, not twice, but three times that there was absolutely no doubt in his mind at the end of the meeting of 31 August with NAIHO that the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO with effect from 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that Mr McDonald, having been put in a very difficult situation by the Minister in a telephone call, is asserting very clearly the position as it was conveyed to him by the Minister. The administration of this Government in this area has been cheap, it has been dishonest, it has tried to hide the truth and it requires the dismissal of this Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very serious accusation has been raised concerning the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). Basically it is that he misled the House of Representatives in particular; but there is a call on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to dismiss the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of his misleading of Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and the subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted Public Service procedures. The fact is that that particular allegation cannot at all be sustained. As for misleading the Parliament, I think we need to go back to the very core and element of this particular allegation. It revolves around an answer given to Mr Shipton in the other place on 8 November 1988. The relevant question was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Has the Minister recommenced funding to that organisation;-</PARA>
<PARA>being the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation-</PARA>
<PARA>and if so, on what grounds?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hand replied:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have met with representatives of that body and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. I am yet to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That remains the fact. Mr Hand is yet to make a decision in relation to the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. That particular answer given in the House of Representatives was confirmed as accurate by the very senior officers who gathered in Mr Hand's office on 8 November. Those present were Mr G. Pryor, Mr R. Winroe, Mr D. O'Rourke, Mr M. Strokowsky and Miss H. Swift. This is what is recorded in a memorandum signed by those present on 1 December:</PARA>
<PARA>The matter of NAIHO was discussed and it was agreed that the Minister should telephone McDonald concerning the Senior Officer Meeting of 5 September as the record of that meeting incorrectly recorded that the Minister had made a funding decision in respect of NAIHO. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then telephoned Mr McDonald in the presence of the abovementioned officers; the conversation was on the conference line it was clear to those in attendance that:-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) Mr McDonald and the Minister were in agreement that the Senior Officer Meeting minutes were not correct as the Minister had not approved funding to NAIHO, as NAIHO had been asked to revise their proposal; and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) Mr McDonald agreed to provide a minute confirming the telephone conversation. </PARA>
<PARA>Immediately following the answer we have that discussion with Mr McDonald-I will obviously make clear, in the absence of Mr McDonald's physical presence, why his taking part in that conversation was important-an indication from those senior officers, including Mr McDonald, that the Minister's answer was, indeed, accurate. On 2 December Mr McDonald, having been asked to recollect a telephone conversation he had with the Minister on that subject on 8 November, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then read me the text of an answer he had given earlier that day to a question about his `decision' to fund NAIHO. I confirmed that the answer was accurate and consistent with my recollection of his advice to me after his meeting with NAIHO some weeks earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>He then stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I have since read the relevant Hansard, which was consistent with the Minister's earlier reading to me, and have no reason to change my view on the accuracy of his reply. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have it only a few days ago. The officer who is mainly concerned in this particular matter and upon whom the members of the Opposition must rely to make out their case that the Minister misled the Parliament, was saying-not merely under the pressure of some phone call that he received from the Minister when he was undertaking other duties in the Perth office, but after he had had the time to read at leisure the relevant Hansard-that he had no reason to change his earlier point of view that the Minister's answer was accurate and consistent with Mr McDonald's recollection of the Minister's advice to Mr McDonald after the meeting with NAIHO at the end of August. </PARA>
<PARA> There it is. There could not be anything plainer. But what has to be looked to is the real genesis of members of the Opposition's concern about this matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to the memo of 3 December, the honourable senator will be pleased to know. Let us not jump ahead of ourselves. What needs to be contrasted with that clear and unambiguous statement by Mr McDonald on 2 December-it is consistent with what is recorded by senior officers on 1 December relating to a conversation held on 8 November-is the minutes of the senior officers group of 5 September. It is recorded in those minutes-the record having been made by an officer who is named at the head of the record of proceedings-that Mr McDonald made this contribution concerning the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. He was purported to have stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a meeting with the Minister on Thursday 1 September, the Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding. This is to be confirmed in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>Senators will recall that it is that minute of the senior officers group of 5 September, the record of proceedings, which provided the whole basis for this series of agitated questions asked by senators both at Question Time and in consideration of the appropriations. The fact is that that minute is inaccurate. The authority for saying that it is inaccurate is Mr McDonald himself. In the minute of 3 December, Mr McDonald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The minutes of the Senior Officers' meeting of September 5 are partly in error. My recollection is that I reported that the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO. There was some comment from several other officers including a question about the cost of this decision. I believe that I estimated the cost would be `about $160,000' but do not agree that I said that the Minister had `directed that NAIHO would receive $180,000'. As you know, the SOM minutes are a much edited version of proceedings and should not be regarded as anything like a verbatim record. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, those particular minutes were taken by members of the Opposition over the last several days as not only a verbatim record of what transpired at that meeting, but as indicating Mr McDonald's true state of mind. They do not. In so far as much of their claim that Mr Hand misled the Parliament has been based on their now revealed as false notion that he directed that NAIHO receive $180,000, then I believe that their case can quickly be seen to be without any firm foundation. Mr McDonald himself repudiated those minutes and claimed that they were not an accurate record of his recollection of the events of 1 September. This is despite the fact that it lay on the record and would have been known to Mr McDonald and others for the period from 5 September to 3 December, almost three months. Nevertheless, even though it was allowed to lie on the record it does not accurately reflect at all what he told that senior officers meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the proof of the matter is in the fact that if, as it is said, Mr Hand decided that there was to be funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, it is odd that months later one can find no evidence whatsoever-because there is no such evidence-that any funding occurred. No funding has occurred. There has been no funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation whatsoever. There has been no authorisation of funds; no approval of money has been directed. Senator Chaney said he thought it was nonsense for us to be looking for some sort of written record of the Minister's authorising the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. The honourable senator wants to talk about proper public administration, and it is also one of the charges laid against the Minister that he is revealed in this sequence of events as not engaging in the proper administration of his portfolio. I would have thought it was absolutely essential that where there is a funding decision by a Minister it be recorded properly. Certainly, that is the practice of Ministers as far as I know. I am sure Senator Newman, who is looking at me, would have expected Mr Newman, when he carried a portfolio, if he authorised a particular funding decision to note it in the normal way, following the usual course in which documents are presented to Ministers for authorisation. </PARA>

I am absolutely astonished that Senator Chaney should think that the funding of an organisation to the tune of $200,000 should be made without any written authorisation by the Minister to that effect. All we have is a series of discussions as to possible funding formulas or options if the Minister wished to carry his disposition through to a decision to fund. He has never denied that he was disposed to fund what he took to be a revamped National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation if in fact it could be shown that it was worthy of such funding. He has indicated that he is favourably disposed, but nothing could properly be done until a number of deliberations and discussions had been undertaken. Of course, nothing was done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, the suggestion that there has been some attempt to falsify the records is a grave charge. There has been no attempt to rewrite history, as has been asserted by Mr McDonald. The fact is that there is no need to make such allegations if one understands that the way in which the matter was raised in the House of Representatives on 8 November naturally alerted the Minister to ensure that his answer was indeed accurate. That is a very normal response by a Minister to--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has not rewritten any records. He sought from the officer primarily involved, Mr McDonald, after Question Time on 8 November a recollection of the events which occurred. That recollection is as outlined on 1 December 1988. Once again Senator Chaney asks us not to believe this point. But the officers present-Mr Pryor, Mr Winroe, Mr O'Rourke, Mr Strokowsky and Miss Swift-all indicate that Mr McDonald had agreed to provide a minute confirming that telephone conversation. I believe that, had that been forthcoming at that time, the Senate would have been spared much of this debate. Indeed, Mr McDonald did provide a minute, as we know, on 2 December, which once again, without going into it at length, makes it abundantly clear that he agreed that the answer given by the Minister was accurate and consistent with his recollection of the matter. That answer was not given just on the basis of an attempt to deal with a telephone conversation; it was given by the Minister with the Hansard in front of him and therefore with the ability to consider the matter more leisurely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the conversations which form the subject of this particular attempt to indicate that the Minister misled the Parliament are taken as a whole they indicate that quite proper discussions took place to ascertain the sources of funding within this portfolio and others should the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation funding have got the proper ministerial green light. As far as the amounts and the sources were concerned, it is quite clear that a lot of work had to be done to enable the Minister to come to a properly considered decision rather than give it some quick deliberation which could then be the subject of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising, though Senator Chaney makes much of it, that the organisation concerned chose to speak as though an agreement had been reached. I have been in many situations where persons with whom one is negotiating or who are lobbying one try to convey at the end of the meeting the impression not just that a sympathetic hearing has been given but also that agreement has been reached and a decision has been arrived at in their favour. This is not a particularly odd occurrence in correspondence and when dealing with people's recollections. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the audit report by Arthur Andersen and Co., which was discussed in the chamber yesterday, the fact is, as I think I indicated during Question Time, that Mr Hand wanted, or at least needed, to be aware of the deliberations and considerations which went into the findings and the recommendations of that particular report, which were not provided to him until the time indicated in the relevant document. Mr Hand, as indicated by Mr McDonald's memorandum, was not in possession of the Arthur Andersen report but needed to be. Mr McDonald was so conscious of the need for his Minister to have a copy of the report that, noting, no doubt, that in the transition from one Minister to another the report possibly had not been made available, he quite properly undertook the task of bringing that report to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in all these matters the Minister has acted as he ought to have done; namely, in giving an answer to Mr Shipton he answered absolutely honestly and accurately, and the recollection of the Minister at Question Time on 8 November 1988 has been vindicated, verified and substantiated by Mr McDonald not only in general telephone conversations after that Question Time, as recorded in the minute of 1 December, but in a very specific paragraph of Mr McDonald's minute of 2 December. </PARA>

The fact is that the Minister's answer of 8 November is accurate and, by no stretch of the imagination, misled the Parliament. It has been vindicated and authorised, as it were, by Mr McDonald in his recollection as recorded in the minute of 2 December. I believe that much of the heat in this matter has a catalyst in the senior officers meeting of 5 December, at least as recorded in minutes which are now agreed by Mr McDonald to be inaccurate; to have not conveyed at all what he told the meeting; and, therefore, to have not conveyed at all his recollection of the truth of that meeting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating an urgency motion brought forward by the Opposition in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Prime Minister to dismiss the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of his misleading of Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation and the subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted public service procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with two items and I do not think the second item has yet been addressed in this debate. The first item deals with the answer given in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in response to a question put to him by Mr Shipton. The second item refers to a question that was raised today in Question Time by Senator Tambling regarding a statement put down by Senator Bolkus on behalf of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) yesterday in Question Time and where that statement will lead us. </PARA>
<PARA> I say at the outset that our view with regard to this matter is somewhat tinged by the exercise that we believe is probably being conducted by the Opposition-that is, an attempt to bolster its policy on Aboriginal affairs-to which my Party is in total opposition. We believe that it is a policy that will only be to the detriment of the Aboriginal people of this country. It purports, amongst a whole host of things, to suggest that Aboriginal people should have equal treatment. There is nothing wrong with equal treatment but, as I stated in a notice of motion in this chamber last week, if Aboriginal people in this country were treated equally their health budget would be far in excess of what it is at the moment. In fact, they have the worst health record and the highest infant mortality rate of any minority group in the world. If equal treatment is to mean anything there should be equality of outcome. Likewise, when land is stolen from the white people in this country it is generally returned to them. When land is stolen from Aboriginals it is said to be something nice. I am quite happy with equal treatment. We totally dissociate ourselves from the Opposition's policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA> This item does not deal with policy; it deals with the attitude of the Minister to Parliament in giving Parliament information. In the various documents that are before us the first matter that is raised refers to the answer given by Mr Hand in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I have met with representatives of that body and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. I am yet to make a decision. I point out that a national inquiry is being conducted by both the States and the Commonwealth regarding future health care policy for Aboriginal people; and that body will be reporting back in February. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the next sentence is also pertinent:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the restructuring I had hoped to have discussions with representatives from NAIHO, if it could be worked out with them, about funding arrangements in December. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a clear implication that a decision is in train and that, if it could be worked out, money would be flowing as early as December. From other documents we know that that is 1 December. I do not think there is any doubt in this range of documents that the Minister was of the view that, pending a number of items, he intended to allow money to go back to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO). Unfortunately, what we are stuck with in this debate is when a decision is a decision for the purposes of the Minister. That is a very difficult one. I believe that in terms of ministerial arrangements the way in which these things are done is fairly idiosyncratic. I imagine that it differs from department to department and from Minister to Minister. Undoubtedly, it is a process in which the Minister receives advice from a number of departmental officers and people in his own office. He reaches a certain decision and that decision might then be put to relevant people. Negotiations and changes may then take place with regard to that decision. A final proposition would then be made in regard to a level of funding that might be given to a particular body. Decisions under those organisations are a process not a point, and I think it is fairly clear that the Minister had embarked on that process. I think it is equally clear that he had not finished that process, at least up till now. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing these documents our position on that question is that we do not believe we have been presented with sufficient evidence to prove the case that the Opposition is putting forward. It may be that those documents are in existence. Obviously, with the leaking of documents from the Department which is going on, those documents may very well turn up. I do not think one can say that, on that basis, the Minister is innocent either. In fact, on the basis of these documents one would have to say that the whole issue smells. But I do not think one could actually say that, on that question, the issue has been proven. I think it is quite a reasonable exercise for a Minister to make a statement that a decision had not been made if he had not finally agreed to sign the paper releasing the money. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe that the other matter, that raised by Senator Tambling earlier this afternoon, is quite different. It relates to answers given yesterday by Senator Bolkus. I hasten to say that I do not think this has anything to do with Senator Bolkus. He was carrying out his job as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and clearly his statement yesterday is-and it is represented in the Hansard in this way-a statement from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> In a minute dated September 8th reference was made to an Auditor-General's report on NAIHO. This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I had not seen that statement but when Senator Tambling raised that matter this afternoon it certainly rang bells with me. A Minister coming into his ministry obviously has a detailed briefing. I find it inconceivable that senior officers-it is probably a matter where the senior officers should be sacked if this occurred-would give a Minister a briefing in which that item would be excluded. It just does not sound credible. </PARA>
<PARA> I went on a hunting expedition which was finally aborted by Senator Tambling turning up some more material from the little fax machine that he has which seems to have a direct link to the filing cabinets in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, when he asks a question, the filing cabinet provides him with the material. Because this material does not have a date on it, I do not know whether this is actually the material in question. Unfortunately we are in the situation of not being able to make a determination until we hear the next speaker as to whether--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept Senator Tambling's interjection. I will provide a copy of this material to the Minister. I have written `July 87' on it because it is probably part of the briefing note; it certainly reads like one. It is headed `National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO)' and sets out the issue, the current position and the background. It gets to the point on page 2. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On 7 May 1986, the Minister instructed that the accounts and administrative practices be audited in depth. The independent professional auditor, Arthur Andersen and Co.-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that the Minister's correction to his own answer in the House of Representatives on 8 November referred to Andersen and Co., so he knew about it on 8 November at least-</PARA>
<PARA>found that NAIHO's system of internal control over operations and finances was inadequate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and so it goes on. The last part states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . such contract projects would depend on NAIHO's putting in place an acceptable core administrative establishment and implementing the recommendations of the Arthur Andersen report. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to deal with vast amounts of paper, as does every senator in this place. If the Minister had said yesterday in his answer to Senator Bolkus, `This report was compiled before I was a Minister and this is the first time I have ever had a chance to read it', I would have accepted that explanation-one does not expect superhuman efforts by Ministers-but he did not say that. He said that this was the first time it was drawn to his attention. He did not even have to read it. It simply had to have been drawn to his attention. If that is correct, the report was drawn to his attention. I do not believe that any other construction can be put on that information. </PARA>
<PARA> It may seem to people who are listening to this debate that this is rather a trivial point, but the document the Minister provided yesterday was by way of a defence document. Presumably it was very carefully worked over. If it was not, there might even be reason for sacking some people. It was very carefully worked over; it had to have been. That was a statement that presumably the Minister himself vetted. If the Minister vetted the statement that Senator Bolkus brought in here yesterday it should have rung bells. He must have known that it had been drawn to his attention before. There may be other constructions that I have not thought of, and that is why I say that, on that issue at least, we are not able to make a determination. At this moment I cannot imagine that there could be any satisfactory explanation brought forward. On any fair reading of this matter-not the original question, which we believe is not proven-and starting where we started, which is from the point of view that the Minister is innocent, and not from where I think the Opposition started, which is that the Minister is guilty, I do not think it takes us to the point where if we were sitting on a jury we would want to deliver a guilty verdict. However, on the second question I find it inescapable that the Minister has in fact misled the Senate, not the House of Representatives. In terms of that part of Senator Chaney's motion, which refers to `. . . subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted public service procedures', I have to wait because, as I said, I do not know whether that second document is authentic. </PARA>

I am simply saying that if that document was in the briefing notes in July 1987 I believe the Minister has misled the Senate in terms of the document that he produced through Senator Bolkus yesterday. Misleading the Senate is extremely serious, and so it should be, because we have to rely on what we are told by Ministers. That is the only way in which this place can operate. It is a serious matter. I will be listening carefully to subsequent speakers, who I hope will be able to say whether this document exists and whether this document is part of the briefing notes and, if so, what explanation they could possibly have for another document coming in here and the Minister saying, `This is the very first time that this has been drawn to my attention'. It is obvious that it was drawn to his attention, or should have been drawn to his attention, in July 1987.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up the debate this afternoon at about the point at which Senator Macklin left off. The extraordinary thing about the development of this issue is the manner in which-as Senator Macklin implied and may even have said-it has been transformed in the past 24 or 36 hours from an accusation or a question about the behaviour of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in misleading the House of Representatives, and I do not resile in any way from that charge, to a further charge, which Senator Macklin has quite rightly said is at least as serious and I suppose to most honourable senators it might be regarded as even more serious, of misleading the Senate. Let us take the particular passage in the Minister's defence which was read into the Hansard yesterday in this place by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who was temporarily representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of the absence through illness of Senator Tate. We are glad to see him back here today. There is a passage in that defence by the Minister, prepared, as Senator Macklin said, as a defence document and therefore presumably very carefully prepared, which says that until the receipt of a minute from his Department dated 8 September 1988, the audit report by Arthur Andersen and Co. into the financial administration of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation had not been brought to his attention. They were the Minister's words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us examine that claim. I will come back to the other aspects of the matter in due course but it is very important to pursue this point now, it having been so cogently raised by Senator Macklin and by Senator Chaney, who spoke earlier. The previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Clyde Holding, underwent a process of education in the portfolio, as all Ministers in that portfolio seem to do. As a consequence he caused NAIHO to be investigated by Arthur Andersen and Co. As a consequence of the very damning report which it submitted and which was tabled in this place yesterday, Mr Holding ordered that funding for NAIHO cease at 31 December 1986. When subsequently Mr Hand became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, as was pointed out in the question asked here earlier this afternoon by my National Party colleague Senator Tambling, the Minister would have received the normal briefing documents from the Department bringing to his attention all matters and issues which in the Department's view required his attention. I presided over the preparation of many such documents and they follow a set pattern. They are brief, they are to the point, and they raise issues which the Department believes the Minister needs to know about. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the Department would have taken the view that in relation to NAIHO the Arthur Andersen report was a matter which the Minister needed to know about. Indeed the Department took that view because, we have been told by Senator Macklin a moment ago, there is now in the possession of at least honourable senators on this side of the chamber a document which we believe to be the briefing paper in question. We trust that before very long the Minister now representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place, Senator Tate, will confirm that by tabling an authenticated copy of the same document from the brief which went to Minister Hand in July 1987. I quote from one or two passages of that document because it makes it perfectly clear that the Minister was made aware of the existence of this document in the first days of his coming to office. The briefing paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>The independent professional auditor, Arthur Andersen and Co., found that NAIHO's system of internal control of operations and finance was inadequate, as was the information and advice provided to the Minister, the Department and other government organisations. . . NAIHO's response to the report was to reject some key aspects of the report, conditionally to accept others, and to demand over $1.75m to implement appropriate recommendations, and a further $22,000 for a full NAIHO executive meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>The minute goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Holding-</PARA>
<PARA>found this ignoring of the major thrust of the report quite unacceptable and personally met with NAIHO officers on 22 September and advised them that DAA direct grants to NAIHO would continue only to the end of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>So it went on. Clearly, the Minister was in possession of that document. Yet the statement by the Minister has been placed before this chamber that 8 September 1988 was the first time that this document was `drawn to his attention'-not read in full, but `drawn to his attention'. Let us have another look at the substance and veracity of that claim. One of the documents tabled in this place on 1 December-that is, last Thursday-was a letter dated 15 February 1988 from the Minister to Mr Shane Houston who rejoices in the title of National Coordinator of NAIHO. In that letter the Minister referred to a meeting which he had had with representatives of NAIHO on 27 January relating to a proposed budget for NAIHO. The Minister said that he was not prepared to agree to their proposals at that time. My point in mentioning this document is this: anyone familiar with Public Service procedures would understand that before the Minister had that meeting with NAIHO representatives, he would have had another specific briefing from his Department-as far as we can see this may have been the first such meeting he had with NAIHO-about the matters he should have in mind when dealing with that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in this place, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that we in the Opposition would be grateful if the Minister would examine the record in that respect also and table, for the information of the Senate, any such briefing paper that went to the Minister in advance of the meeting of 27 January. We will see whether there was any mention in that briefing paper-if such a briefing existed-of the Arthur Andersen report. Certainly, if there had been such a mention, how could the Minister say, through his mouthpiece yesterday, that 8 September this year was the first time the report had been `drawn to his attention'?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chaney" NAMEID="EF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is clearly and obviously wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Chaney interjects, that is clearly and obviously wrong, and it is clearly and obviously misleading the Senate. I come back to later events commencing with the meeting between the Minister and NAIHO representatives on 31 August 1988, to which there has been a lot of reference already. As Senator Chaney said, there was a briefing minute on 29 August to the Minister by Mr McDonald, which has been tabled in this place, for the purpose of that meeting. That minute was seen by the Minister because it carries his personal annotation sending it back to the Department and asking, `Refer details of meeting to D. McDonald as soon as possible'. The minute refers to attachment I and attachment II which were tabled in this place yesterday because Senator Tate failed to table them last Thursday, no doubt through inadvertence. Both attachments to that document referred to the Arthur Andersen report. They are not lengthy, involved or complicated attachments. The first is a single page which states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It makes-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the submission to the Minister from NAIHO-</PARA>
<PARA>no indication that any attempt has been made to address issues of concern identified by Arthur Andersen in its 1986 audit report. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is in black and white in an attachment to a minute which went to the Minister on 29 August, which the Minister has clearly seen. As Senator Chaney said in the Senate earlier, there was more detailed reference to the Arthur Andersen report in attachment II to the document. Mr McDonald recorded a note for file about that meeting, which he was excluded from attending even though he was the senior officer in the Department and supposedly responsible for dealing with these matters. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the meeting the Minister informed me that he had approved funding of about-</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `about'-</PARA>
<PARA>$180,000 for NAIHO with effect from 1 December. He would confirm this with a written advice to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The final sentence of Mr McDonald's minute has not received much attention. I draw the Senate's attention to that sentence which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In response to a question from me, the Minister agreed that points 1 and 2 in attachment II of the attached brief were an appropriate description of NAIHO's role for the purpose of the letter of offer. </PARA>
<PARA>Two points arise from that. The first is that Mr McDonald there records that he personally drew the Minister's attention to attachment II to the briefing minute. There can be no question that the Minister saw attachment II, if there was any question in the first place. Secondly, Mr McDonald records that the Minister agreed that the two points referred to serve as an appropriate description of NAIHO's role `for the purpose of the letter of offer'. One does not write a letter of offer unless one has decided to fund. One may have not decided finally on the amount of funding down to the last $1,000 or $5,000, as NAIHO itself pleaded, but one has decided to fund. That makes a nonsense of the Minister's subsequent claim in the other place that no decision had been made. That view is strongly confirmed by the letter written by Mr Houston and the other NAIHO representative at the meeting of 31 August to the Minister on the following day-that is, 1 September-following up. They began their letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to follow on from the discussions of yesterday . . . In undertaking the fine tuning of the agreement reached yesterday . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There was also the record of the departmental senior officers' meeting which I think Senator Chaney has already dealt with at some length. I do not propose to go over the same ground. There was a series of relatively insignificant minutes-on their face-following that meeting, the first being a handwritten note from Mr McDonald to Mr West, who I think is in the Minister's office, saying that the Minister's office was to `Refer details of the meeting to D. McDonald as soon as possible'. `They aren't here. Can't they be chased up, please?' On 22 August Mr McDonald wrote again-this time to the Senior Private Secretary-saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I have not yet received these details, particularly those relating to the level of the Minister's funding approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Following that minute, did Mr McDonald receive a question from the Minister's office and the Senior Private Secretary saying, `What funding approval? The Minister has not decided to make any funding to NAIHO yet'? Did any such minute issue? Not a bit of it. It was only subsequently, on 1 December or, as the officers in question allege on 8 November, that they purportedly came to the view that no such funding agreement had been arrived at. There was never any process back to the Department to question this stream of minutes which went from Mr McDonald. There was no attempt to question at that stage the record of the senior officers' meeting of 5 September which gave the same understanding. There was no attempt at any time to do things required by normal public service process and procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> The clear implication is: firstly, that the Minister did mislead the House of Representatives on 8 November when he replied to the question from the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Shipton. Secondly, after having given that answer, there was a hurried conference in the Minister's office between five people, including three departmental officers. A conversation then took place between the Minister and the hapless Mr McDonald in Perth. Through that course we have had an attempt to rewrite the history of this matter. </PARA>

With respect to the comments made by Senator Macklin on the second part of the motion, I think it is fair to say that the Opposition currently has a new toy to play with.

It is important that the Senate take note of the context in which the first question was asked by Mr Shipton on 8 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Minister recommenced funding to that organisation-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, NAIHO-</PARA>
<PARA>and if so, on what grounds?</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to that question, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am yet to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That answer was absolutely correct. In respect of providing a decision for which the Minister was properly accountable to the Parliament, he had not made a decision. It is a fact that in this plethora of documents which have been tabled in the Parliament, not a single document exists which directs the Department to take the necessary action required following a proper ministerial decision to fund NAIHO. In fact, Mr McDonald's interpretation of events claims that the funding was to commence on 1 December. To this day, 6 December, demonstrably no such funding has gone to NAIHO and the documents which have been tabled demonstrate that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats made the appropriate point that, if one reads these documents with a predisposition to judge the Minister guilty, one could interpret them as leading to that conclusion. If one were fair and read the documents dispassionately, one would find the reality is that they indicate that there was no such decision. One can go back to 15 February this year, when there was a letter from the Minister to Mr Houston, who headed NAIHO. I will confine myself to reading the final paragraph because of time constraints. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated to you at our meeting on 27 January, I am not prepared to agree to your proposal at this time, although I remain open to any suggestions which may emerge from my forthcoming meetings with Aboriginal people throughout Australia or from the National Conference of Aboriginal Health Services in Sydney in February. I would expect, however, that any arrangement which I will be able to approve would need to cost substantially less than the $448,000 which your budget proposes. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter of 1 September from NAIHO, upon which the Opposition places such great weight, also indicates clearly that there was no final ministerial decision for which the Minister is accountable to Parliament. The second last paragraph of that letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind the budget position as discussed, we would seek your agreement to a small increase in the indicative figure of $193,000 of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words `indicative figure'. It is an indication--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the honourable senator that I am perfectly capable of making my own points and I listened to him in complete silence. It is an indicative figure. If the Minister had attempted to mislead the Parliament by saying that he was opposed to NAIHO receiving any funding, perhaps there would be some purpose in the Opposition's motion. The Minister has made it perfectly clear to the Parliament-not once, but twice-that he is fundamentally in favour of funding NAIHO. There is no secret about that. The Minister conveyed to the Parliament quite forthrightly that he is predisposed to refund this organisation, provided it is restructured. There is no question at all that the Minister discussed potential funding for NAIHO, because he is on the public record of the Parliament as having said that. The question is: What constitutes a decision upon which the Minister is properly accountable to the Parliament? The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, gave a fascinating interview with Pru Goward this morning. I think, considering Fred's record as Leader of the Opposition--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it was a fairly friendly salutation. If the honourable senator wants me to abuse the Leader of the Opposition instead, I will. Anyone can call me Bob. As far as Fred's record as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is concerned-and it was a good one-he was far more precise in applying the tests to his own decision making than he applied to Minister Hand in his interview this morning. Pru Goward asked the question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>But his basic defence-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Gerry Hand's defence-</PARA>
<PARA>is that he has never denied that he supports re-funding the health organisation?</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. The Minister said that in Parliament. Senator Chaney replied:</PARA>
<PARA>We're reduced to playing with words, Pru. I mean, and at that stage he hadn't. But what he replied in the Parliament was that he had yet to make a decision. And yet the contemporaneous documents, the documents that were prepared back at that time, at the end of August, the beginning of September, make it quite clear that he had made a decision. It wasn't a decision which was final as to amount. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor indeed was it final as to anything else. Pru Goward then said:</PARA>
<PARA>But Gerry Hand argued on `AM' that he had checked this quite carefully with his Department and, because he had signed nothing, then it wasn't officially approved. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that is the test which applies to ministerial decision making as far as accountability to Parliament is concerned. Pru asked:</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be official until he's signed something?</PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that assertion, to which the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate replied in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I think that's very much a lawyer's argument and doesn't really fit in with the political realities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a nonsensical statement, because the reality is that Ministers do have to make decisions which comply with the law as well as with the politics of the day. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. Of course the Minister has to be legally and politically accountable in his decision making. I am glad he did not apply the same tests to his own decision making as he applies to this Minister's. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I look forward to Senator Walters's contribution to this debate. Let us have a look at the rest of these papers, particularly the minute of 18 October this year, which was signed by Glenda Humes, whom I know to be a very competent officer of the Department, and which is well and truly after the meeting of 31 August. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I raised the question of NAIHO funding again with Harriett Swift who apologised for the delay in sending the Dept relevant info concerning the funding. She said that there is some concern about the precise amount needed and that 2 staff positions (TAP funded by DEET) needed to be sorted out and how long would they be funded under DEET. </PARA>
<PARA>This memo clearly indicates that the Minister had not made a final decision to fund NAIHO. In fact, the decision, as the NAIHO letter itself points out, was conditional on a number of matters which had at this point not been resolved. When the Minister makes a decision for which he is properly accountable to the Parliament, that decision is backed up with a ministerial directive to his Department to commence the funding. For reasons of which I am not aware, but of which the Minister was certainly aware, and clearly related to matters with which he was not satisfied, that minute was never sent to the Department. There was no directive; there was no decision made to fund NAIHO. Therefore, the answer given to the Parliament on 8 November and again on 1 December was absolutely correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is nonsense. Because I have canvassed it, I have to devote some time to the last part of the original motion, which has now been changed during the debate, relating to the discrepancy between the statement made by Mr McDonald on 2 December and the one made by him subsequently in which he corrected the record. The fact is that the statement made by Mr McDonald dated 2 December is absolutely unequivocal in respect of its reference to whether the Minister misled the Parliament. Mr McDonald said categorically that in his view the Minister did not mislead the Parliament. How then can this discrepancy have occurred? I am prepared to offer my own suggestion, which I think is the correct one. I preface my comments by saying that this is purely my own view on the matter; I have not had the benefit of speaking to Mr McDonald about it, nor would I personally consider it to be proper if I did so. What I have to say is purely speculation on my part about the matter; but I think it is probably correct. The statement that Mr McDonald made on 2 December is absolutely correct and accords with all of the papers that have been tabled in this Parliament that the Minister had not made a final decision on funding NAIHO. The Minister indicated that he was predisposed to fund it but had not made a final decision, as all of the papers attest. Therefore, his answer to the Parliament was correct. Mr McDonald confirmed that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what happened subsequently? An article in the Weekend Australian of 3-4 December 1988, which I read last night and with which I have no dispute, makes a number of references to Mr McDonald which obviously would have been quite personally hurtful to him. Time constraints forbid me from quoting the article more fully. In any case, people can read it for themselves. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> So Mr McDonald agrees now that he was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> How do we know about Mr Hand's talk with Mr McDonald in which the latter saw the error of his ways?</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA> With Mr McDonald's rethink, Mr Hand has closed the circle of self-protection.</PARA>
<PARA>I have commented often in the 12 years that I have been a member of parliament that the reality is that people in politics tend to forget the impact on people not engaged in politics of being quoted in newspapers, particularly in a non-complimentary fashion. This sort of thing upsets them considerably. On a number of occasions over the years people have come to me who have been quite distraught because they have received any publicly at all. This sort of publicity does upset people. It is absolutely clear from any fair reading of the contribution--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not concern me. I am talking about people who are not involved in politics. It is clear from both the opening and closing paragraphs of the letter that Mr McDonald wrote, clearly under some distress, on 3 December that he was deeply upset about the article that appeared in the Weekend Australian. That is what has prompted him. There has been no pressure from the Minister and no pressure from the Department. He wrote his original note on 2 December in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. That was simply his clear recollection. But he was absolutely distressed when he read the Weekend Australian, as I imagine a lot of people in his position would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is simply a question of interpretation. Both stories are probably correct. The Minister was clearly predisposed to fund NAIHO. He probably said as much to Mr McDonald. In fact, I am sure he did say as much to Mr McDonald. But it is clear from any fair reading of the minutes, of the attachments and of the notes flowing backwards and forwards to the Department that the Minister had not made that decision. That decision was not made. The Minister had not made a decision for which he was properly accountable to this Parliament and, therefore, the answers given by the Minister on both 8 November and 1 December in the House of Representatives were absolutely correct. The motion should fail; the Minister did not mislead the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about propriety in government; it is about basic acceptable standards of ministerial conduct. It is about ministerial responsibility and integrity. It is about the cardinal principle of our whole parliamentary system-that Parliament be the forum where the truth, and only the truth, is told. That is what this debate is about. These are the criteria and the principles against which the conduct of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, and the conduct and standards of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are to be judged. On each of these criteria, on each of these basic principles, there can be only one judgment of Mr Hand's conduct in this sorry, sordid affair, and that judgment is failure-failure to maintain acceptable basic standards of ministerial conduct and ministerial responsibility; failure to tell the Parliament the truth and only the truth at all times. There is only one honourable course open to any Minister who has so breached this basic essential standard, and that course is resignation. There is only one honourable course open to a Prime Minister whose Minister fails to meet these basic standards and who, nevertheless, refuses to resign, and that is dismissal of that Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government is once again under the spotlight of public propriety-this time because of the actions of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. However, this is by no means the first time that the spotlight has been so focused on this Government. Just 12 months ago, another Hawke Cabinet Minister, Mr John Brown, was forced to resign because he told lies in the Parliament over an Expo contract. We all remember Mr Mick Young and his notorious breaches of ministerial propriety over the Harris-Daishowa affair, the Paddington Bear affair and, most importantly, the Combe-Ivanov affair, when he placed the very security of this country at risk. Then we had Mr Keating, the winner of the award for the world's second worst Treasurer, and the scandalous misuse by him of his travelling allowance and the privileged treatment he was given by the Australian Taxation Commissioner. The list of failed, disgraced Hawke Government Ministers is long. It is growing, and Mr Hand is merely following in notable company. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter at issue is very simple; the charge is simple and unambiguous. That charge is that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, misled the Parliament on 8 November and, again, just last Thursday on 1 December when he claimed, in response to questions from the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Shipton, that he had not yet taken a decision to fund the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO). He also misled the Parliament-this time the Senate-yet again yesterday when he claimed in this place, through Senator Bolkus, not to have been advised prior to 8 September this year of the Arthur Andersen and Co. report on NAIHO. I seek leave to table a briefing note on that matter which we understand Mr Hand received from his Department when he first became Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence that Mr Hand had taken a decision to fund NAIHO on 31 August is both damning and overwhelming. Senator Chaney documented the case very fully and adequately when leading off this urgency debate on behalf of the Opposition. Let me just repeat some of that damning, unequivocal, overwhelming evidence. Let me stress that this is not hearsay evidence or evidence that dropped off the back of a truck, as Mr Hand quite stupidly claimed on AM this morning. It is evidence contained in documents tabled in this Senate in recent days by Government Ministers themselves. The case is very simple, very clear cut and very unambiguous. It is that the Minister had a meeting with representatives of NAIHO on 31 August to discuss its application for re-funding by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We have no written evidence of what actually took place at that meeting on 31 August because there appears to be no written record of the meeting available. What we do know, however, is that immediately after the meeting the Minister advised a senior departmental officer, Mr Don McDonald-I quote directly from his note for file written the following day-that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . he had approved funding of about $180,000 for NAIHO with effect from 1 December. He-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>would confirm this with a written advice to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The conversation between the Minister and Mr McDonald-who incidentally, it was intended would attend the meeting with NAIHO but he was subsequently excluded-was not just a fleeting conversation between a Minister and a public servant. Mr McDonald records in his note for file of 1 September that he discussed with the Minister the appropriate description of NAIHO's role for the purpose of the letter of offer to the organisation, a point that Senator Stone picked up so well. How can we have a letter of offer of something when there has been no decision taken? Mr McDonald has elaborated on that discussion with the Minister in his much later minute of 3 September. In paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of that minute Mr McDonald said:</PARA>
<PARA>2. Let me make it quite clear from the outset that I have absolutely no doubt that, at the end of his meeting of 31 August with NAIHO, the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO with effect from 1 December. He conveyed that decision to me verbally immediately after the meeting. Ms Harriett Swift of the Minister's staff was also present at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>3. I am very clear on our discussion, which took place in the Minister's own office. He said ``I have decided to fund NAIHO . . . obviously you don't agree with that decision''. I replied ``obviously'' but made no further comment. The Minister then went on to discuss aspects of his decision, including the fact that he had told NAIHO representatives that they could purchase a car if they were prepared to go without some other item from their capital budget. </PARA>
<PARA>4. During our discussion the Minister also said that he thought the Department of Employment, Education and Training `DEET' might meet some of the salary costs of NAIHO's budget, which would reduce the total cost of DAA's contribution. A figure of $180,000 was mentioned as the total cost although this was a `ballpark' figure, rather than a firm budget. I also asked the Minister about the purposes which I should include in the Department's letter of offer to NAIHO. I recommended two of the three points from NAIHO's 1986 letter of offer. The Minister agreed with this. I think we would hardly have got to this sort of detail if we `the Minister and I' had not been certain that the decision to fund NAIHO was firm. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will note that Mr McDonald has stated that a member of the Minister's own staff, Ms Harriett Swift, was present during this discussion. Ms Swift has not at any time, to the Opposition's knowledge, refuted Mr McDonald's understanding of that discussion between the Minister and Mr McDonald on 31 August. The evidence suggests strongly the contrary. I refer the Senate to two documents to support the view that Ms Swift's understanding was that the Minister had agreed to fund NAIHO and that the only question to be resolved was the level of funding. The first document is a minute from Mr McDonald to a first assistant secretary, programs policy, on 13 October, where in a handwritten postscript he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I also raised the issue of NAIHO funding with Ms Swift and Andrew Jackomos on 12 October. They said they still had one aspect to sort out. </PARA>
<PARA>In an internal minute on 18 October Ms Glenda Humes, to whom Senator Collins referred, and who by that time appears to have taken over Mr McDonald's duties-and why, we have not been told-said:</PARA>
<PARA>I raised the question of NAIHO funding again with Harriett Swift who apologised for the delay in sending the Department relevant information concerning the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> She said that there is some concern about the precise amount needed and that 2 staff positions . . . needed to be sorted out eg how long would they be funded under DEET. </PARA>
<PARA>All that evidence makes it inconceivable that if Ms Swift did not agree with Mr McDonald's interpretation of his discussion with the Minister on 31 August, these file notes would exist. These notes can mean only one thing-that is, that Ms Swift, too, believed that the Minister had already agreed to fund NAIHO. There is more evidence to support this. In particular, there is the minute from Mr McDonald to the Minister's senior private secretary, Mr Pryor, dated 22 September, pointing out for the third time that he had not yet received details of the 31 August meeting between the Minister and NAIHO as the Minister had directed, including, Mr McDonald wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . particularly those relating to the level of the Minister's funding approval for the organisation. Until I receive this I will not be in a position to process funding action. </PARA>
<PARA>That minute was written to the Minister's senior private secretary three weeks after the Minister's meeting with NAIHO. Mr Pryor, the Minister's senior private secretary, was at that meeting. If the Minister had not agreed to fund NAIHO, then Mr Pryor would have corrected Mr McDonald's understanding as contained in that 22 September minute. He did not do this. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone into this amount of detail because it needs to be made absolutely clear that this matter is not simply one person's word against another's. It is not simply a matter of Mr Hand's word against Mr McDonald's word. All the evidence supports overwhelmingly the fact that the Minister told Mr McDonald on 31 August that he had agreed to re-fund NAIHO. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not yet referred to NAIHO's letter to the Minister dated 1 September, the day after the Minister's meeting with NAIHO. That letter appears to make it clear that the Minister told the NAIHO representatives that he had agreed to re-funding. That would seem to be the logical conclusion from the first paragraph of that letter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>In undertaking the fine tuning of the agreement reached yesterday I would ask that we consider the following points. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to discuss various points of detail. Even if these words are subject to a different interpretation, as Mr Hand claimed in his statement read into the Senate on his behalf by Senator Bolkus yesterday, that would still not affect in any way the validity of the Opposition's charge that Mr Hand told officers of his Department and his own staff immediately after the meeting with NAIHO that he had decided to fund the organisation. There is more evidence of a similar nature to that which I have already outlined to indicate quite conclusively that the Minister failed to tell the truth in the House of Representatives on 8 November and on 1 December and in this Senate through Senator Bolkus yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very limited time remaining I want to turn briefly to a matter with which Senator Stone dealt so comprehensively-that is, the appropriate Public Service and ministerial procedures in respect of decision taking. Mr Hand's assertion on AM this morning that a decision is not a decision until it is fully signed off in writing by a Minister is simply ludicrous. If this were a commonly accepted view, then all public-and I might say, private sector-activity would cease forthwith. Was the Minister seriously suggesting, for example, that a Cabinet decision is not a decision until the Cabinet minute has been prepared and finalised, that decisions taken within his Department are not decisions until someone has signed something, that a decision made by him and conveyed to an officer of his Department has no effect until it has been signed off in writing, or that an undertaking the Minister might give on behalf of the Government with an outside person or organisation carries no significance at all until it has been documented and signed by the Minister? What absolute nonsense? No organisation can work on that basis and they do not even pretend to. </PARA>
<PARA> In my 20 years in the Commonwealth Public Service, in my dealings with Ministers and others over that time, from both sides of politics, and in my years in industry, I never once saw business done on that basis. Why? Because it would cause all decision making to grind to a halt. Mr Hand's statement this morning was quite nonsensical. It was a red herring, a straw man, and I treat it with the contempt that it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of urgency moved by Senator Chaney today is of the utmost importance. The Opposition's motion should not be necessary. Mr Hand should have resigned voluntarily by now. That he has not done this, and neither has Mr Hawke exercised his responsibility as Prime Minister to dismiss Ministers who lie to the Parliament and to the Australian people, speaks volumes for the extent to which basic standards of propriety, integrity, responsibility and decency in government have sunk under this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the motion that is before us, not the one that I think the Opposition wishes it had before us in light of some of the evidence it claims to have come up with at Question Time. The motion relates to two things. It relates to an allegation that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has misled the Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO)-that is, whether or not it was funded, which is a debate about the answers given in December-and to allegations of subsequent attempts to falsify the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has not been a lot of consideration given to those allegations because the Opposition has been trying to tack some new items on in the hope that they will bolster what is otherwise a very weak argument. We are not talking here about some minor criticism of the Minister. The proposal is that the Minister ought to be dismissed. Obviously, it requires a very serious finding of error by the Minister to justify that. I do not pretend that, if a Minister is found to have misled the Parliament, that is in any way minor. I am not endeavouring to do that. Certainly, in a matter as serious as that which is addressed in the questions of 8 November and 1 December, if the answers had been misleading it would have been an extremely serious matter. But I think the evidence that has been put by Senator Tate and Senator Collins, and to which I wish to refer, establishes that those answers were not misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to the allegation of `subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted public service procedures'. I find this allegation a cause of significant concern, not because I think the Minister has done such a thing or because any evidence has been presented that he even attempted to do so, but because the only way someone can substantiate a claim that there had been an attempt by the Minister to falsify the record in any of the matters referred to is to have it sustained that there was a conspiracy by the Minister and several senior public servants so to do. I regard that as an absolutely deplorable allegation against senior, responsible, respected public servants-not people appointed to their positions by this Government, not political hatchet people or whatever-who have held senior positions under both governments in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA). That little tack on, in the hope that it will help put together a threadbare case, is an absolutely unreasonable proposal which has not been substantiated. </PARA>

They just wish it were true because it would substantiate their case, so they assert it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to make one brief diversion to deal with the point that Senator Chaney made early in his remarks about the compounding concern about inefficient administration in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs under Minister Hand. There are various definitions of what constitutes efficient administration, but I simply want to refer to the figures that are published in the annual report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs dealing with the proportion of the funding to DAA which goes to administration as against projects. Those figures show that the proportion of DAA funding absorbed in administration in 1987-88 was the lowest in 15 years-I might say, 25 per cent lower than when Senator Chaney was the Minister. I make that point because there has been an attempt to paint a background that is entirely misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the specific matter before us: Did the Minister mislead the Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation? It comes back to that question of whether or not he made a decision. I will deal with the Hansard quotes in a moment. We are not asking whether he had made up his mind about whether it ought to be funded or whether he had formed an opinion, but whether he had made something that could reasonably be interpreted as a decision. Many people have defined what is not a decision but let us talk about what is. The Oxford Dictionary refers to a decision in this context as the settlement of an issue. </PARA>

But no decision in the sense of the obvious context of the answer that he gave to Mr Shipton, no final decision that would lead to funding that organisation, no decision to recommence funding, has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, as I said, the Minister has made up his mind about some matters and he has made that very clear to the Parliament. He has made up his mind that he has a predisposition to fund a national Aboriginal health body if the appropriate conditions are met. In that sense of the word `decide' lots of decisions are made, but they are not decisions to recommence funding, which was the question asked by Mr Shipton. He asked: `Has the Minister recommenced funding to that organisation?' The answer to that question is that no such decision has been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why didn't he write back to NAIHO the day after receiving that letter and tell them it was in error?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly and simply, no such decision has been made. I will come back to the NAIHO letter in a moment. There are a series of qualifications and preconditions upon any agreement before it can get to the stage of being a decision capable of being implemented. It was quite clear, and it is clear in the letter from NAIHO and in all the comments that have been made and actions that have taken place since, that further negotiations were to be required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interpretation of `decision'-in this context the final settlement of an issue-is reinforced by the context of the Minister's reply and by the questions from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) to which he was replying. The subsequent motions which Mr Shipton tried to move on 1 December gave a very clear indication of what the Opposition thought it was onto, but it was quite wrong. The basis upon which he proceeded has been acknowledged, I think by everybody now, as absolutely incorrect. The question on 1 December asked whether the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 in funding this year, prior to the answer he gave me to my question in this House on 8 November 1988?</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly he did not. I think everybody acknowledges that he did not-certainly Mr McDonald does-and no action has been taken. If we want to interpret whether a decision has been made, we should look at the context and at the subsequent actions to see what happened after the alleged decision, between 31 August and 6 December. Alternatively, if people want to indulge in conspiracy theories, let us go back to between 31 August and 8 November, when the matter was first raised in the Parliament. No action was taken by the Minister to implement any so-called decision to fund NAIHO. There was plenty of time for action to be taken, but none was taken because no such decision had been made. Dealing in that context with those questions and answers, both Senator Tambling and Senator Stone have said by way of interjection that the Minister made no reference in those two answers to the need for the restructuring of NAIHO. They are absolutely incorrect. In both answers he made it quite explicit that it was agreed in the negotiations that a condition would be the restructuring of an Aboriginal and Islander health body. The loose allegations that are made here do not reflect any credit on the people who make them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have subsequent evidence also that no decision had been made. We find a note from Mr Jackomos of the Minister's staff to Mr McDonald seeking further information about the NAIHO audit report. We find there quite clearly that that is the sort of query that is made preparatory to any final decision. It is not subsequent to a decision. One does not ask about those things after one has made the decision; one asks before. That is what is being done-further information is being sought. All the information from Mr McDonald on 13 October and from Miss Humes on 18 October is the same. They are saying that there are still matters to be sorted out; the matter is not finalised. There is no question of the Minister's predisposition to fund NAIHO once the negotiations are settled if a satisfactory agreement can be achieved about the amount of money, about the purpose to which the money is put and about the structure of the organisation which is to receive the money. That is not a big secret. The Minister has made that clear on every occasion it has been discussed in the Parliament and in public. </PARA>
<PARA> That combination of conclusions reached does not constitute a decision, a final settlement of the matter. It does not come close to constituting a final settlement of the matter. As Acting Chief Justice Fox said in the Federal Court in 1981, when talking about public administration:</PARA>
<PARA> In ordinary usage, the special feature of a decision is its conclusiveness, or finality for the time being, and this is to be contrasted with the thought or consideration which precedes it. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that in defining terms some people like to use `loosely' misleadingly in the hope that people will not understand what the words mean. That is very unfortunate for them, and that is--</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Chaney had to admit this morning on radio that it was not a decision which was final. That is absolutely correct. There is a process that leads to a decision. There are a lot of stages in that process. If each of those stages is to be defined as a decision, then the English language no longer makes any sense, and the process of decision making in government no longer means what anybody has previously thought it to mean. There is certainly nothing in the statements made by anybody in this Parliament, or in any of the documents that have been tabled, that contradicts Mr Hand's view that he had not made a decision to recommence funding NAIHO. Even if Mr McDonald is right about the discussion that took place on 31 August- and I am not saying whether he is right or wrong because it was a conversation between two individuals to which nobody here was privy; I suspect the truth lies somewhere in between because the memory plays tricks on everybody-it does not establish that a decision had been made to recommence funding NAIHO, which was the question that the Minister was required to answer and which he was answering. After reading Hansard, Mr McDonald was prepared to confirm his previous advice that the Minister's statement was accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to have been forgotten in some of the discussions what the Minister actually said, in the enthusiasm to find that he might have misled someone. It is clear that no decision has been made to recommence funding NAIHO, but what has happened is that funding arrangements have been discussed. The Minister has said that he hopes to have worked out funding by December. That is not a secret; that is what he said in the Parliament on 8 November. He had a predisposition which was probably understood by NAIHO and Mr McDonald to fund such a body and that the figure might be about $180,000 to $200,000. That is not a secret either. That is what he is reported to have said, in the Hansard of 1 December. He did not mislead the Parliament. There is no need to hide behind technicalities. The motion should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> We should get away from this series of attempts to create diversions from the principal issues that are before us in Australian politics and in the discussion of matters to do with Aboriginal affairs. We should get away from attempts to destroy people's characters. We should not get involved in muckraking exercises. We should get back to dealing with fundamental issues of concern to Aboriginal people. Therefore, I think the motion should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for that statement and for the tabling, which confirms the matters which were raised by the Opposition; namely, that as long ago as July 1987 the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) received advice on the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) which included reference to the report of the independent auditors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak very briefly in response, in the few minutes that remain in this debate, not least because of the closing remarks of Senator McMullan, who made a plea that we should stop destroying people's reputations and stop muckraking. I totally reject that quite offensive statement and remind Senator McMullan that in this difficult area the problem that we are consistently facing in this Parliament is the getting of accurate information about matters where there is clearly serious maladministration. The Opposition makes no apology for bringing these matters forward and will continue to do so. We put the Government on notice that, with the very strong interest in Aboriginal affairs matters on the Opposition benches, we will continue to deal with issues of maladministration as they come to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of things can be said in terms of the defence which was mounted. The principal defence during the debate was: how could it be said that the Minister had agreed to funding when so far no funding had gone to NAIHO? That demonstrates the thinness of the defence available to the Minister. Since this matter was raised in the Parliament on 8 November it has been a matter of extraordinary concern at the political level and the Minister has been trying ever since to tailor his situation to meet the fact that the Opposition had raised this matter. The simple points that can be made which demonstrate quite clearly that this Parliament has been misled are to move away from the areas where there has been an attempt to muddy the stream, to demonstrate that in some way poor Mr McDonald did not really mean it when he said over and over again that the Minister had made it plain to him that he had agreed to funding. The organisation which met with the Minister in August of this year and wrote the next day made it clear that it regarded itself as having obtained an agreement for funding from the Government, subject, certainly, to negotiation on detail. </PARA>
<PARA> That letter, which was dated 1 September and received by the Minister shortly afterwards, has not been responded to. There has been no attempt to correct the statement contained in that letter that the meeting with the Minister resulted in agreement. I draw the attention of the Senate again to the consistent statements made by Mr McDonald that he has absolutely no doubt that at the end of the Minister's meeting on 31 August with NAIHO the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO with effect from 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more cogent and beyond challenge is the fact that only yesterday the Minister told us, through the mouth of Senator Bolkus, that the report was compiled before he was the Minister and that it was the first time it had been drawn to his attention. We have now had the clearest possible illustration that in July 1987 the Minister was briefed on the existence of this report. We have a very strong inference drawn by Senator Stone that before the meeting of January 1988 it would again have been brought to his attention. It is not a matter of inference but a simple unassailable fact that the memorandum that was prepared for the Minister for his meeting with NAIHO in August contains the clearest possible references to the independent audit. The attachments in which those references were made were specifically drawn to the Minister's attention and the Minister has signed the minute from the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is conclusive. I commend the motion to the Senate, and I trust that this motion will be a lesson to the Government that the Parliament is entitled to accurate information from its Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to the report entitled Taxation Statistics 1985-86. In particular, I wish to refer to a table on page 426 of the report which has some very interesting data on fringe benefits tax. For example, it is clear that total collections from that tax nationally from July 1986 until the end of March last year were $528m, of which only $9.4m was collected from the rural sector. When we look at the proportion of the total collections of fringe benefits tax from the rural sector, based on this official report, we find that only 1.8 per cent of all fringe benefits tax collected in Australia came from the farm sector. In fact, 5,300 primary producers throughout Australia actually paid the tax-about 3 per cent of all primary producers in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the statistics report from the Commissioner of Taxation suggests that 97 per cent of farm producers did not pay fringe benefits tax; It is very interesting to note that of the $9.4m collected in the farm sector, only $1.3m came from farm partnerships and only $300,000 in fringe benefits tax was collected from sole traders. In total, only $1.6m came from partnerships and sole traders, compared with $5.9m from farm companies, both private and public. That breakdown suggests pretty strongly to me that the fringe benefits tax, to the limited extent that it was paid by the farm sector, was paid by people incorporated as companies or private companies. Presumably farmers with lower incomes paid far less fringe benefits tax than the wealthiest farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think these figures really do expose as scare campaigns the campaigns that have been run over recent years by both the Liberal Party and the National Party about the fringe benefits tax. Members of the Opposition have been right round Australia in every State over the last several years trying to scare farm sector producers by saying that they would be liable for the fringe benefits tax and that they would be financially disadvantaged and inconvenienced by the fringe benefits tax. The figures in the Tax Commissioner's statistics report make it clear that the extravagant claims about the fringe benefits tax made by the Opposition and the National Farmers Federation over recent years were, in fact, pure fiction. The figures do not support the suggestion that the farm sector would be hit heavily by the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, many primary producers around Australia clearly were misled by the Opposition's claims. Needless and baseless financial worries were caused to a number of farmers as a result of these scare campaigns about the fringe benefits tax. Both the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia stand condemned for making claims about the fringe benefits tax which clearly had little relevance to the everyday position of the overwhelming majority of Australian farmers. Only recently I have seen letters in rural newspapers in my State trying to convey the impression that most farmers are paying the fringe benefits tax. I have made the point that the Tax Commissioner's statistics suggest that 97 per cent of farmers in Australia have not had to pay fringe benefits tax. That exposes very clearly indeed the claims made by Opposition politicians about the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the revenue being collected as a result of the fringe benefits tax-$848m last financial year-will help finance the reductions in personal income tax which will occur next year. So while few farmers paid fringe benefits tax, many will qualify for the reductions in personal income tax next year which will be funded in part by the revenue collected from the fringe benefits tax. So there is to be a quite important redistribution of tax in the Australian community. Many will benefit from the income tax cuts; few have paid fringe benefits tax. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to address my remarks on the annual report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the section in the report entitled `Community Based, Aboriginals and Youth Affairs'. This section of the report deals essentially with the community youth support scheme (CYSS), the community training program (CTP) and the community volunteer program (CVP), which the Government has decided from 1 January 1989 will be amalgamated and funded under the auspices of Skillshare. I address this subject as one who has had considerable experience in the workings of the community youth support scheme, having been Chairman of the Clarence CYSS for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department states that the aims of these community based programs are to encourage communities to assist unemployed people at the local level and to develop their capacity for obtaining and retaining employment. The idea of encouraging communities to work together to seek answers to the growing problem of unemployment is certainly a commendable one and one which in theory provides a catalyst for some very worthwhile programs. It is appropriate when discussing this report to encourage the many thousands of people throughout Australia who have provided invaluable assistance to CYSS, CTP and CVP in a voluntary capacity over the years. Their hours of unpaid assistance and professional expertise have allowed these programs to fulfil their role. It is quite obvious that without these community minded people many of these programs would not operate at all. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government introduced the concept of Skillshare I, like many others, welcomed it because as a former CYSS chairman I was aware of the multitude of training schemes and other volunteer based schemes that existed in the community. I always had the feeling that these schemes would be of much more practical value if they were amalgamated. I was pleased to see that the Government, quite rightly, decided to bring at least these three schemes under the one umbrella. This amalgamation takes away from the community youth support scheme the support that those young unemployed people have relied upon, but replaces it with a more practical training scheme to try to develop some skills that could be of benefit to the young unemployed. Under Skillshare the age restrictions have been completely abolished, so there are no specific schemes for youth under the present program. It will cater for all unemployed. Skillshare was lauded as the answer to all these programs and at the same time it promised ongoing commitment to assist the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has failed to acknowledge that the introduction of Skillshare will go hand in hand with the demise of some existing CYSS groups. I refer particularly to programs in New Norfolk, Queenstown and Clarence, in Tasmania, which have so far failed to receive Skillshare funding. The situation in New Norfolk and in Queenstown, which I visited last Saturday, is particularly critical as both these communities are very isolated. Prior to the new scheme CYSS was the only form of assistance that the unemployed youth received in those regions. For those people who have not been to Queenstown, the closest area to be found which has any semblance of a Skillshare scheme would be either Launceston or possibly Brighton, which are some 300 kilometres away. This means it is impossible for those unemployed young people to receive any support or assistance. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Last night in the adjournment debate I raised in passing the way in which the loss by the Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) last year of $1.5m has been covered up by this Government, and an attempt has now been made in the Authority's annual report to hide this loss from those people who read only the report section rather than the detailed accounts at the end of the report. It is a disgrace that any government institution, any government body, experiencing a loss of $1.5m should put out a report in which that loss is not discussed, revealed or stated in the signed part of the report-which is what one would imagine would be the section of the report which outlines to readers what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, having outlined that extraordinary and unexplained loss last night, that many other elements of this annual report have come to my notice and have caused me a great deal of concern. I have had a good look at the cost per student training day, which is about $165. It costs $165 a day for every student who attends the Trade Union Training Authority. I know it is difficult to make comparisons but that figure is about four times as much as the average cost to educate someone at a tertiary institution. It is probably three times as much as it costs to teach someone to be a doctor. I am not quite certain how the Authority has managed to reach that level. When one looks at the details of individual increased costs in the annual report one finds that in the four years from 1983-84 to June 1988 salaries have rocketed from only $172,000 to 5 1/2 times that amount-$4m. But the number of student training days has increased by only 56 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that salaries per student training day have more than trebled, from $18.40 to $66.80. Course costs-and I presume that they are the other non-salary costs involved in these courses-have jumped 2 1/2 times over this period, from $739,000 to $1.9m, increasing the course costs per student training day from $19.10 to $30.80. </PARA>
<PARA> What on earth is going on in this college? These extraordinary figures seem to coincide with the running down of the Clyde Cameron College at Wodonga. Is the Government deliberately getting rid of that college? Is it winding it down so far as to be non-existent? In view of the fact that this report does not give the answers, I think the people of Australia have a right to ask: What is the real story? We see this report saying that it is a matter of grave concern that cuts in TUTA's allocation have been enforced for 1988-89. That is simply not true. The taxpayer will be paying more next year for TUTA. The taxpayers' contribution will go up from $7.8m in 1987-88 to $8.5m this year-another hefty increase. However, expenditure is going down. Instead of losing $1.5m, TUTA's expenditure is being cut to $8.5m so that income and expenditure will apparently match. But the reality is that there is to be an increased contribution to an organisation which appears incapable of efficiently and effectively managing its own finances. I think the Senate deserves a proper explanation about why TUTA has managed to lose $1 1/2m and why it has managed to put on so many extra people when its expenditure went far beyond the increasing allocations that have been made to the organisation by this Government. I see in the Forward Estimates that TUTA is still intending to increase its staffing level beyond last year's level even though the total expenditure is to fall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to comment on the annual report of the Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) and, in particular, on part of the supplementary information that was provided subsequent to the Estimates Committee A hearings in October. During those Estimates Committee hearings, when we were looking at TUTA, I asked several questions relating to the matter just raised by Senator Michael Baume-that is, the question of student training day costs and how they compared with those of other institutions. It was said in evidence that it was almost impossible to compare TUTA with any other form of educative institution. It is interesting that in subsequent information I was told:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The ratio of gross expenditure per student training day referred to by Senator Bishop is calculated to provide only one imperfect measurement of the improving efficiency of TUTA's performance. Over recent years, this ratio has fallen substantially and in 1987/88 showed an 11.5% improvement over the previous year. However, it is based on TUTA's gross expenditure for administration, State centre, city and country training, College residential training and national training, liaison and co-ordination and therefore has little relevance other than as an internal indicator. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that less than convincing, particularly when TUTA is claiming in that paragraph an improvement in efficiency. Yet, as Senator Baume has just pointed out, TUTA managed to sustain a $1.5m deficit which it made up by selling off assets. In addition, we find on page 27 of this report under the heading `Contracts Exceeding $100,000' dealing with TUTA's need to comply with section 47 (a) of the Trade Union Training Authority Act:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Authority has been advised that the provisions of paragraph 47 (a) were breached during 1987/88 on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter refers to the investment of amounts of $100,000 or more at any one time when it is necessary to obtain approval. On page 18 of the report under the heading `Current Assets' and the subheading `Cash on Hand and at Bank' we see a deficit of $154,545. We see subsequently in the report that TUTA did not go into deficit at all because, although the cheques were drawn, presumably they were not paid, posted or banked. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, I find the management of TUTA far from satisfactory. It has traded at a loss; it has been in breach of required provisions; and it has managed to finish with a deficit in its cash on hand although, as I have said, it subsequently managed not to go into overdraft because the cheques were dealt with in some fashion that allowed that not to occur. I just wanted to register my feeling, as a member of Senate Estimates Committee A, that TUTA has a lot to answer for, and we will be most interested to look at it again in six months time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It rather disgusts me to hear people on the opposite side of the chamber at every occasion attacking an organisation which, over recent years since its inception, has provided an opportunity for trade unionists to be trained in a proper fashion-an area which is so important in Australia. Time and again we hear people from the Liberal and National parties saying that there is a need to increase productivity, that there is a need for better relations between employers and employees, and that if this is not done our future will be in dire peril. These people also talk about the need to have negotiations at plant level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that the Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) has done very well over time has been to bring together trade union officers and trade union leaders from around this country; to indicate to them the way in which our industrial relations authorities operate; to advise them of the best ways in which to negotiate; and also to encourage them to be forward thinkers and to be creative in looking at new ways in which they can operate on behalf of the people they represent and in a way which will bring benefits to this country. I think it has done that very well. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard talk about additional amounts that have been spent. No-one has said for one minute that that money was not spent properly and was not accounted for. I notice in the report this statement from the Australian Audit Office:</PARA>
<PARA> the statements are based on proper accounts and records</PARA>
<PARA> the statements show fairly the financial transactions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there is no problem there. People feel that it is all right to spend a lot of money to train people in management, as has occurred over many years in universities and other company situations, to get the best deal for shareholders and those people who own the means of production and have had power in this country, but as soon as a Labor government establishes an organisation that, in fairness, provides training for workers to represent the people and provides the opportunity for trade union officials to become more effective and efficient on their behalf, all of a sudden that is a terrible thing. </PARA>
<PARA> If there has been an increase in the amount of money spent I would want to look at a number of things. One of the things I would want to ask would be: What has TUTA done with the money? I notice that the report talks about training performance. In 1983-84 there were 601 courses and in 1987-88 there were 1,069 courses. I will not suggest that, because we have more courses, it will necessarily result in an improvement in the courses. But I am suggesting that a lot more work has been done. There is more understanding and cooperation in the community and there has been more forward thinking on the part of trade unions. They have initiated propositions to change awards by restructuring them. They have looked at new career paths. They have looked at opportunities which can be given to people, whatever their age and whatever industry they are in, to gradually improve their ability by learning new skills, by accepting more responsibility. Provided that management has the ability to take the advantage of it, higher productivity and benefits will flow to the community. It would be better if people such as Senator Bishop were to look at the positive aspects of TUTA and recognise that it does an excellent and constructive job for this country and that it needs to do it in a bigger and better way in the future. If the organisations that have been established by this Government to help various sections of the community had all achieved the same level of excellence and were all as productive and as useful to the community as TUTA, Australia would be doing very well. I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the opening policy content in the report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In view of the debates that we have had in the last few days, it is important to note that it draws attention to the way in which the Aboriginal people were disregarded by the white settlers who came to this country, to the fact that many of the original inhabitants were dispossessed and dispersed, and that their culture was disrupted-which is a point that needs to be stressed over and over again-and threatened. Today their descendants are the most disadvantaged people in the Australian society. The report details a number of ways in which Aboriginal people are dealt with as second class citizens in a predominantly white society in which their individual cultural contribution to the society is under-recognised or totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> The report mentions among other things that the average Aboriginal life expectancy at birth is 15 to 20 years less than that of other Australians. It mentions that Aboriginal infant mortality, while improving, is still three times that of non-Aboriginal Australians. It says that there is a higher incidence of communicable diseases, such as hepatitis B, and that there are lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart disease which are more prevalent among Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reflects upon the culture in which Aboriginal people lived in this country for 40,000 years, it is clear that those diseases were not prevalent before white settlement. The quality of nutrition for Aboriginal people under tribal conditions was extremely good, except in times of extreme drought. A number of the native foods were extremely rich in protein and in essential amino acids. With the lower intake of refined carbohydrates Aborigines did not suffer from diseases such as diabetes or heart disease to the extent they do today. Those diseases have been imposed on Aboriginal people by white society.</PARA>
<PARA> The list goes on. It says that Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average, that Aboriginals earn only half the income of other Australians, that they live in substandard housing, and that the imprisonment rates for Aboriginal people are 14 times those of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to a couple of figures which are shown early in the report. I do so because of statements which Opposition members have been hammering very hard in recent days, in which they have been stressing the way in which money that has been spent by this Department and also by the Aboriginal Development Commission has been wasted. The Opposition has been talking about how, with the wave of a hand, millions of dollars have been going down the drain. The Department has an average staffing level of 721, representing 0.43 per cent of the Commonwealth Public Service. The Aboriginal population is 1.43 per cent of the total population of Australia. So on a per capita basis they have approximately one-third the number of public servants employed in Aboriginal Affairs. Of the total Commonwealth Budget outlays, 0.83 per cent goes to the Aboriginal area. Again, that is approximately half what is spent on other Australians. Those figures need to be kept very clearly in mind when the Opposition lays into those departments which deal with Aboriginal affairs and claims that they are wasting money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have but nine or 10 minutes left in which to speak, regrettably I have to rush through my speech at a much more superficial level than I would have wished. Prior to the disruption of my speech, I was making the point that the proponents of the tax on gold companies base their arguments around the obsessive quest for equity in taxation. They argue that the non-gold producing companies in the mineral sector are in an underprivileged position when compared with goldmining companies. A couple of points need to be made in that regard. First, gold exploration is a high risk enterprise and, therefore, is dependent on equity and retained earnings to finance the venture. It is unable to raise capital on the basis of using as security long term contracts because gold sales are all on spot markets. In this regard, the comments of Dr Alan Reynolds, the chief economist of Polyconomics in the United States, should be noted. He correctly stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The whole point of exempting gold from Australia's corporate tax has been to lower that industry's cost of equity capital. Taxing both corporate profits and capital gains at 49 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>as it then was-</PARA>
<PARA>which no successful economy does-is a ``double tax'' on retained profits. That biases the tax system against high risk enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be realised that the gold industry must take the price for which it can sell its gold as set by world commodity prices. In a 1975 study the United States economist and the now Senator Phil Gramm said:</PARA>
<PARA>If the policy is to reduce output, employment and investment as little as possible, the worst type of industry to tax is one that must take a world commodity price as given. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the goldmining industry is. That makes a mockery of Senator Cook's answer to a question without notice in October that if Australia's miners accelerate their development they will run the risk of bringing down the market price by putting more gold on the market. Given that Australia produces only 6 per cent of the world's supply of gold, it is equally clear that a tax-induced reduction of investment which reduces supply will not raise the price of gold, just as a tax-induced increase of supply will not lower prices. I find it devastating that Senator Cook, the Minister for Resources, could come in here and put that absurd proposition to us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that the tax free status of goldmining companies diverts some investment away from other mining companies into gold. However, this is not to say that other mining industries are disadvantaged by the level of investment in goldmining. The strength of the goldmining industry has historically been an important factor in facilitating exploration for other minerals. The goldmining centre of Kalgoorlie is a classic example of that. As a result of the gold boom of the late 1800s came possibly the largest and certainly the most daring engineering project of its kind in the world at that time: the pumping of water from Perth to the goldfields of Kalgoorlie through a pipeline over a distance of 600 kilometres. It was the supply of that water which allowed Kalgoorlie to exist as a town in its own right after the gold boom died. Since then it has become a very significant centre for the exploration and development of a wide range of other minerals. Therefore, it cannot be realistically asserted that the other mining industries are significantly disadvantaged by a prospering gold industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, faced with a tax system which has become an irrefutable example of a successful economic policy in industry, chooses not to adopt the system as a model. Instead, it feels morally obliged to cripple all industries evenly. It is widely recognised-at least on the non-Labor side of politics-that Australia's low savings and investment rates, combined with high levels of private and public consumption, are the prime factors behind our high current account and foreign deficits. Of course, it is not surprising that Australia's savings rate is a mere 23 per cent of gross domestic product compared with 31 and 32 per cent in Korea and Japan respectively. In this regard I refer the Senate to an article in last weekend's Sydney Morning Herald which reported the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) as recognising that savings could be increased by lowering the tax on interest earned on savings-a logically compelling proposition. In other words, what EPAC is saying is that the double taxation of income impacts adversely on savings and investment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore clear that, if we are to level the playing field of taxation in pursuit of equity, we should not be raising gold to the high levels of taxation which currently apply to the rest of the economy. Rather, as Professor Michael Porter said in a speech in October this year:</PARA>
<PARA> We should be generating a playing field in which all savings and investment is largely exempt from taxation, thereby removing the double taxation of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the taxation arrangements currently applying to the gold industry should be used as a model on which to base taxation generally-that is, an environment in which there are no incentives to invest in gold over other forms of investment: in other words, simply reduce the level of taxation and have the same sort of taxation system that now exists essentially in the gold industry for all industries, with different write-off provisions in terms of investment cost. To create this environment, Porter and the Centre of Policy Studies use an adjusted income tax which nets out investment expenditure from the income tax base. In comparison, however, the Hawke Government would abolish the taxation regime applying to gold in an attempt to create a level playing field by raising taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems not to have fully understood the extent to which the loss to revenue will be recovered by the imputation and capital gains clawback. What the Government has clearly failed to consider is the fact that the reduction in exploration and goldmining development which, by necessity, will result from the removal of the exemption will obviously reduce the activity being taxed. Accordingly, there will be less revenue from the proposed company tax than is estimated and, further, less revenue will be collected from payroll tax, employees' income tax and, of course, shareholders' tax from the capital gains tax and dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Hawke Government has underestimated the extent to which the tax will cripple the industry. Senator Cook, as I mentioned this morning, has clearly demonstrated the Government's ignorance of the nature of the goldmining industry. In providing answers to questions without notice in this chamber, the Minister claimed that 20 new goldmines were commissioned in 1987-88, 10 of them after the May economic statement announcement of the gold tax. The Minister has also said that a further 30 mines were expected to come on stream by the end of the year. I merely refer Senator Cook and the Senate to an article by Malcolm Hollingsworth in the November edition of Australia's Mining Monthly, which is a very interesting monthly magazine. Notwithstanding that Mr Hollingsworth is a friend of Senator Cook, he said he could not understand how a Minister of this Government could be so incompetent in terms of his announcement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Your list of the 30 mines starting up this year. . . justifying the impost, names two mines that are in the wrong States, one that has finished mining and another that has its name misspelt. </PARA>
<PARA>He gave a long list of the failings of the proposition which has been put by Senator Cook. I would be interested to know whether the Minister thinks that companies have indulged in a sudden rush of highly successful exploration since the May economic statement. He certainly must find it convenient to ignore the fact that these mines are the result of long term exploration projects. Large investments have already been sunk not only into exploration but also into processing plants. Of equal importance is the fact that high risk factors have already been accepted-risks that were taken under assurances from the Hawke Government that a tax on gold would not be introduced. Nobody believed it, but people were compelled to proceed and now they are reaping the rewards of their belief. Such statements can only serve to reduce the credibility of the Government's revenue estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The termination of the gold industry's tax exempt status will offer no benefits to any other sector of the Australian economy. The tragedy is that this tax will not offer relief to any other sector of the economy. The tax is simply a further impost which will go into this Government's total revenue and there will be no benefits and no cuts for anybody else. I condemn the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a long list of Opposition speakers on the three Bills which we are debating cognately because they all represent the tax profile of the Labor Government, which for six years has been more tax and a greater burden on the Australian people-both individuals and companies. This Government has had a six-year pattern of increasing the tax burden on the Australian people in terms of sales tax imposts and every other kind of tax. There is only one glimmer of hope or good news in all the measures before us in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) and the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill; that is, the implementation of the May 1988 decision to cut company tax in Australia from 49c to 39c in the dollar, a reform which we in the Opposition have urged upon this Government for years and which we announced in our policy as one of the priority measures that we would introduce in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is only one of the measures that a Liberal-National Party government would introduce. We give even more priority to the need to cut personal income tax so that the burden placed by the Labor Government on Australian families can be lifted-so that they can be restored to the level of available income to spend at their own discretion that they had in 1982, before the momentum developed year by year in increasing tax imposts on Australian families. We have announced in recent years, particularly before the last election, and it was reiterated in our commentary on the May statement and the recent Budget, that a Liberal-National Party government would significantly cut income taxation, taxes on families. I believe that that will be seen by Australian families only after the election of a Liberal-National Party government. Certainly, there is no news of tax cuts for ordinary Australians and for Australian families in any of the measures now before the Senate. There are adjustments to sales tax, to company tax, and to a number of other taxes, such as the gold tax, which my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne was just now addressing in his speech. But there is no news of any income cuts for individuals and for families. </PARA>
<PARA> Even now, whilst there is still speculation that there may be such cuts from 1 July next year, by measures yet to be announced, debated, or implemented by legislation, those cuts are in doubt. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) have made contradictory statements as to whether the country can afford the tax cuts which the Labor Government has begun to promise in its off-the-cuff statements. The Labor Government is being met by the public of Australia saying, `You've given this tax cut to companies from 49c to 39c and we are feeling the increasing burden on us, as a family. When are we going to get tax cuts? When will we be restored to the same income level which we had before the Labor Government was elected?'. In recent weeks the message has been that because the foundation of the present Labor Budget was based on solving Australia's balance of payments problem and that this has blown away from all of the estimates and standards on which this Budget was built, to give tax cuts may lead to yet further imbalance in this country's balance of payments. If the tax cuts were given, would not Australians spend that money increasingly by overseas purchases, and would this not lead to a yet further unsound position for the Australian economy?</PARA>
<PARA> Nervous doubts in the minds of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have created signals in recent weeks that the tax cuts for individuals and for families may not be on. Another reason they are in doubt is that they are being linked by the Labor Government's Ministers to a tax-wage trade-off with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It is still to be seen whether the proposal, particularly from Mr Kelty, about the restructuring of wages will be economically responsible and will allow the tax cuts. If the restructuring which the ACTU and the trade union movement want to put in place is going to create irresponsible increases in wages, then the Government will say, `Bang go the tax cuts'. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, we all have grave doubts as to whether or not the Labor Government will deliver its promise on tax cuts. In the Opposition our position is firm. If elected to government, a Liberal-National Party government will bring tax cuts to individuals and to families. We are conscious that the Labor Government, when talking about its hope to have a $20 a week tax cut for the average worker, will fall short by more than $30 a week because of the erosion of available income in the hands of the average worker of some $56 a week that has accrued during the six years of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government. Will the tax cuts be $56 a week, to return to the position of 1982 before the election of this Labor Government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne says that somebody is going to jump over the moon before that will happen. I know that in this chamber Senator Walsh has said that the Australian public should not be expecting $56 a week tax cuts for the average wage earner. Even on the best admission-setting aside the two areas of doubt of which I have spoken with regard to the wage-tax trade-off or with regard to the balance of payments-the Government is wanting to dampen expectations by saying, `No, we will not give the $56 a week in tax cuts. You will be lucky to get $20 a week'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I highlighted this important matter in my opening remarks, because it is only on some occasions that we have before us tax Bills such as the package of these three Bills being debated tonight in the Senate. Not only must we denounce this Government for placing more and more burdens upon the Australian people through its increasing tax measures, but we must draw attention in this chamber to the failure of this Government to give any tax relief to the individuals and families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been remarked on by many commentators that the Hawke-Keating Government is the biggest taxing government in Australian history. That is a record which has been held for six years in a row. The first year, as this chamber will recall, in which the Hawke-Keating Government brought down a Budget was 1983. The Senate will recall the change of government in March 1983. Some months later, in August of that year, the first Labor Government Budget came down and established a tax burden on Australians that broke all previous records. Not only was the burden and the strain of that Budget felt by the Australian people in 1983, but the next year the Hawke-Keating Labor Government broke its own record as the highest taxing government in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern has continued in 1985, 1986, 1987, and again this year, 1988. The increase in the tax burden on the Australian people is not only in monetary terms, in that the tax take is more billions of dollars in each of those six years, but also in real terms. Taking account of inflation, coming back to the real purchasing power of the Australian dollar, the tax burden on the Australian people in real terms has increased in each of the six year of the Labor Government. Top priority should be given to tax reforms so that this tax burden can be eased. I can only assure this Senate that, given the track record of the Labor Government, the only way that this situation will be remedied is for a Liberal-National Party government to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA> With those introductory remarks which join with my colleagues in their contributions about the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), I wish to concentrate my remarks on the third Bill, which is the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill is 2 1/2 pages long. I am sure that the Government did not want any of us to refer to this tiny Bill in the debate on the tax measures that are before the Senate. The few sentences in the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) contain no reference whatsoever to the retrospective aspects of this sales tax measure, nor to the bumbling mistakes that the Government has made with regard to its comprehensive reform of sales tax. `Reform' is too nice a description; I should say `increased burden', which is what will happen as a result of these sales tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate would accept the proposition that an elected government with a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled in its Budget or May statement to increase sales tax in a way which is consistent across the spectrum and is fair, one sector to another. The fact is that the Government forgot to include some of those consistent measures in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1988 [No. 2] which it introduced this year. In November, only last month, the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) introduced into the House of Representatives the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988 to tidy up the position. The Minister had the gall and the arrogance to say that in effect this Bill will operate from the same day-that is, 8 o'clock on Budget day in August-as do the other sales tax measures. But the Australian public, and particularly the companies which are affected by this sales tax measure, have had no warning. On the contrary, they thought that the sales tax legislation that was introduced into the Parliament in August did implement the full extent of the Government's decisions. The measure that is before us now would create a grave injustice and it must be amended by the Senate. If it is not amended, it will have a retrospective effect which is unfair. We must not allow the Government to slip in this small piece of legislation in the hope that it will not be noticed among the sales tax measures before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the history of this matter. Since 1935 there has been, among the exemptions listed in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, an exemption under item 92 for bags-plastic and paper bags that contain foods and other items. These paper and other bags have had a longstanding exemption from sales tax. General references were made in the Budget announcements for this year to removing certain exemptions affecting goods used by retailers to wrap or secure goods for marketing or delivery. It is most important to note that specific legislation, not a general announcement, is needed to confirm the exact items which will attract sales tax. It is in this respect that the Government left Australia in confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I believe it is fair for you, me and other members of this chamber to be entitled to think that the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1988 [No. 2] that was introduced in the House of Representatives on 23 August would cover all of the concrete expressions of the Government's intentions and that the people affected could order their affairs accordingly. We accept the principle that changes in tax announced on Budget night can operate from that date, so long as the legislation is consistent with that announcement. The Bill introduced on 23 August made no change to item 92 in the first schedule of the Act, although changes were made to numerous other items. The legislation duly passed through the Parliament and became law. One might have thought that that was the end of the matter and that the position was clear for the foreseeable future. But this is not the case. Because the Government messed it up and because there was an inconsistency, the Government introduced a further Bill on 3 November-the Bill to amend item 92. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, unfortunately it has been announced that the amendment will have retrospective effect from Budget night when it should have effect only from 3 November, the day on which the Bill was introduced into the Parliament. This Bill clearly corrects in a concrete and specific way what we in this Parliament and the public would have expected the earlier measure to contain. People were entitled to think that the Government was not planning to amend item 92. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has frequently had reason to criticise the Government's practice of legislation by press release-even in regard to tax matters. This practice causes uncertainty among taxpayers who have to organise their affairs on the basis of vague press statements with detailed legislation following months or, as we have seen recently-as Senator Messner would know very well-even years later. I draw an analogy between this Bill and the process of legislation by press release that I am criticising. In this instance, the Government is relying on its words of 23 August which were presented in the most general form. Surely the Senate will insist that the Government cannot get away with this kind of approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers who have been operating on the basis of the actual legislation of 23 August are now being told that this was wrongly drafted and that they will bear the consequences, the costs, of the Government's own mistake. Clearly, that is not good enough. It is important that there should be certainty about taxation laws, especially in respect of sales tax, which wholesalers pass on to retailers. There needs to be certainty when a transaction occurs so that wholesalers and retailers know that the sales tax has been calculated correctly. That amount of money owing by way of sales tax is then passed on to the Commissioner of Taxation and the Australian Taxation Office. But there should not be any kind of uncertainty or dithering. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite the specific effect that this Bill will have on Detmold Packaging, a firm in my State of South Australia which manufactures bags. In the 10-week period between 23 August and 3 November this company operated on the basis that the legislation before the Parliament in August expressed the Government's policy and sold bags worth $1.11m. Detmold has been told that it will have to hand over $187,000 in sales tax in respect of the $1 million sale of paper bags. This decision is totally wrong. I see that Senator Foreman, another senator from South Australia, who is sitting on the other side of the chamber, agrees with me in his heart and mind that in this day and age that sort of penalty on a good South Australian firm should not be imposed. Governments ought to be able to get their announcements about legislation sufficiently in order that South Australian companies such as this do not suffer that kind of penalty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was joining the many in the Opposition who, with regard to the three tax Bills before us, have decried the present Hawke Labor Government for the tax burden that has been placed upon the Australian people. We saw record taxation in 1983, taxation Australia had never before experienced. In 1984 taxation increased to a new record. In 1985, 1986 and 1987 it increased again. The burden of taxation borne by the Australian people is still unsurpassed in 1988. When we have three taxation Bills before the Senate it is timely to remind this chamber of the record tax burden that has been placed on Australians by the Hawke-Keating Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the measures before us we see increase after increase in taxation, with the only good news being company tax being lowered from 49c to 39c in the dollar. There is no mention whatsoever of any tax cuts for the ordinary Australian, for individual taxpayers or for families. I mentioned before the suspension of the sitting that the tax cuts we all look for-that we in the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, firmly promise on coming to government after the next election-are now in jeopardy because the Government has in mind a tax-wage trade-off that appears to be related to the Kelty restructuring of wages. In addition, the balance of payments problem has so undermined the viability of the Government's Budget that again there is uncertainty about tax cuts coming to individuals and families. These measures are not before us in the Senate. They are in jeopardy, even with regard to the hopeful date of 1 July next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The only tax cuts that will be worthy of the name are those that may be worth $56 a week to the average taxpayer. If we had tax cuts of that dimension it would at least bring Australian families back to the level of discretionary income that they had in real terms before the present Government was elected in 1983. That is what we are sure will not be achieved by the present Labor Government. It is talking about tax cuts of only $20 a week, not $56 a week, for the average taxpayer. I have my own doubts that there will be tax cuts even of $20 a week for ordinary Australians. To give tax cuts of $20 a week will return only a small portion of the tax hike that we have all suffered as a result of the record breaking taxation burden that the Labor Government has placed on us. It would return only a small part of what has arisen from one measure alone, that is, bracket creep, whereby the incomes of families, through inflation alone, rising through the taxation levels leads to a greater tax take by the Government. Bracket creep has taken scores of dollars a week from the average family. We are not even given the promise that this bracket creep take by the present Government will be returned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have particularly addressed the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and shown how this second sales tax Bill to come before the Senate has arisen because the Government messed up its sales tax announcements in the Budget Speech and in the legislation introduced at the time of the Budget. This has led to this additional sales tax measure, which was introduced on 3 November. </PARA>
<PARA> I have highlighted how this will affect just one company in my State of South Australia, Detmold Packaging, which manufactures paper bags and other bags. For example, with this legislation taking effect from Budget day, 23 August, instead of the day on which it was introduced into the Parliament, 3 November, this will lead to that one company, Detmold Packaging, having to hand over $187,000 in tax that it did not expect and was not liable for. The effect on this one company that I highlighted prior to the dinner break is a good illustration of why this Bill must be amended by the Senate. I believe it will be amended by the Senate because the Australian Democrats have agreed with the Opposition to remedy the faults of the Government in this proposal so that it should operate only from 3 November. On the initiative of the Liberal and National parties, we will deny the retrospective reach of this sales tax measure. It should not reach back before 3 November. Our amendment, with the support of the majority of this chamber, will ensure that there is not a penalty on taxpayers--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988. My remarks will be devoted to the first of these Bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, and specifically to that part of the Bill which effects, as from 1 January 1991, the removal of the exemption from company tax which is presently enjoyed by the goldmining industry. Having listened to the debate on this matter over the last day or so, you will be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are numerous things that can be said about this legislation. For example, it can be argued, and has been argued in this place, that the goldmining industry is one of our most thriving industries-as indeed it is. But, for that matter, so would be any other industry that enjoyed the same freedom from company tax as does the goldmining industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It can also be argued, and has been argued here, that the goldmining industry is a major contributor to our export income and that, particularly with our present disastrous balance of payments, this should be a major consideration when thinking about the tax regime to be applied to this industry. Indeed, that industry is a major contributor to our export income. But so would any other export industry be if it enjoyed the same freedom from company tax as does the goldmining industry when no other industries enjoy that freedom. Let us just imagine the contribution to exports that our wool industry, for example, could make. It already makes a very big one. Just imagine how much bigger a one it could make if it were totally free of company income tax. Just imagine what a contribution the engineering manufacturing industry, for example, could make-or dozens of others. It can be argued, and has been here in the last day or so, that the goldmining industry is vital to the lives of many of our remote outback communities, as well as to other centres such as Kalgoorlie, which may not be quite in that category but which nevertheless are thriving centres of population in areas well removed from their respective metropolitan cities-Perth in the case of Kalgoorlie. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of digression, I should say that my mother grew up in Kalgoorlie, so I have a certain affection for that city and the industry around which its fortunes revolve. Indeed, my grandfather, the man after whom I am named, John Owen Hunt, as he was called, died and was buried there in 1905, having been employed on one of the great mines. All the things that are argued in favour of the importance of the goldmining industry to the maintenance and survival of these remote outback communities and other centres such as Kalgoorlie are true. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the same would be true, although no doubt in different specific localities, if an income tax exemption were granted to all other activities undertaken in remote localities, however defined. I am not advocating that. I am simply making the point in passing that in this respect also the argument is not singular to the goldmining industry. Indeed, the only point I want to make in these few opening remarks is that there is nothing special about the goldmining industry as such so far as any of these particular arguments are concerned. The arguments concern the advantages to any industry which accrue to it when it is granted exemption from a tax which every other industry within the economy pays. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a major change in the system of company taxation in Australia in the last year or so through the introduction of the so-called imputation system, the taxation of company dividends. It is worth while spending a little time on the implications of that for the matter I am talking about here tonight. Let us think about the effects of that change in the income tax area. Let us assume that a goldmining company which is paying dividends has some shareholders who are Australian residents and liable to Australian tax and other shareholders who are foreign residents and therefore not liable to Australian tax as such, although dividends payable to them are, of course, subject to dividend withholding tax, which in most cases would be levied at the rate applicable to countries with which Australia has a double taxation agreement, namely, 10 per cent. It is 20 per cent in the case of other countries, but they are insignificant for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As things stand today, with no company tax levied on goldmining companies, Australian shareholders who receive dividends from goldmining companies pay the full marginal rate of personal income tax upon those dividends. Let us say it is 50.25 per cent, including the Medicare rebate. As I indicated a moment ago, foreigners are not liable to that tax, although their dividends are subject to dividend withholding tax at, let us say, the rate of 10 per cent applicable to countries with which we have double taxation agreements. When those foreign shareholders submit their taxation returns to their own national governments, let us say, the Government of the United States of America or the Government of Britain, they are entitled to claim credit against the taxation to which they would otherwise be liable in their own countries for the dividend withholding tax that they have paid or that has been paid on their dividends. Otherwise those dividends become fully taxable, subject to that credit, in their hands in the countries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) pointed out, quite accurately, in such cases foreign treasuries do pick up the difference between the 10 per cent dividend withholding tax credit and whatever the personal rate of the shareholder concerned is. The result is that the foreign shareholder is levied at precisely the same rate as he would be if he was paying tax on a share of a company in his own country. But what is happening in that case is that the foreign treasuries benefit, naturally enough. Australians who receive dividends from a goldmining company will, because those goldmining companies pay no company tax, be levied at the full marginal rate. They will not be able to claim an imputation credit because of the nature of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal in the Bill is to impose company tax on goldmining companies as from 1 January 1991. If companies then pay dividends to Australians, those Australians will then be entitled to claim the imputation rebate in respect of the company tax which has been paid on their behalf by the company. So they will not be any worse off as a result of the change in the system, or at least not in respect of income tax. I will come in a moment to the question of whether they would be worse off as a result of capital appreciation of their shares; that is a different matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In future foreign shareholders will be able to claim a credit in respect of the tax paid by the company. That will mean that the amount of tax they will be liable to pay themselves will be reduced. The only loser will be the treasuries in the United States of America, Britain or wherever the shareholder has his or her residence. We have a situation there where, basically, there is no real detriment to the foreign shareholder or to the Australian shareholder as a result of the action. We have a situation where the companies are paying tax where they did not pay tax before. The Australian Taxation Office will pick up tax from the companies, but foreign treasuries will not pick up tax from the companies. I personally cannot see why one could reasonably object to that situation on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, another area of interest for shareholders, and that is in respect of the capital appreciation of their shareholdings. It is true that where one has, as at present, company income untaxed, then profits which are ploughed back on an untaxed basis, as distinct from being distributed, increase the net worth of a company at a faster rate than such profits would increase it if they were ploughed back on a taxed basis, by definition. That is another way of saying that the capital appreciation of such shares over a period under the present situation is more rapid than it is likely to be after those companies start paying tax. I do not think there is any real argument about that. One should say, for the sake of completeness, that following the introduction of capital gains tax, which I personally did not agree with and which will be removed by the Opposition when it is elected to government, the difference between the effective value in the hands of the shareholders of those differential rates of appreciation of the company shares has been diminished. As I say, that is a qualification to the more general point. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation where, in the absence of company tax, our Taxation Office does not get any tax, in effect, from foreign shareholders other than the dividend withholding tax and does get tax from Australian shareholders if dividends are distributable; whereas with taxation at the company level our Taxation Office gets the tax from both Australian and foreign shareholders, but Australian shareholders then receive imputation credit in respect of any dividends payable to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some commentators have suggested, notwithstanding these on the whole rather persuasive arguments in favour of the levelling of the playing field approach, that the goldmining industry is a kind of tax haven within our taxation system-along with the principal private residence, for example. After all, the principal private residence does not attract tax in terms of the imputed rent or imputed income which we derive from our private residences; it does not attract capital gains tax, and it does not count for the purposes of the assets test for the age pension. So the principal private residence is an exceedingly valuable and exceedingly singular asset within our present tax welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have suggested that goldmining companies are in a somewhat similar position in so far as they represent one other area of the total economic firmament, so to speak, where people have a chance still to earn a decent income from an investment and, hence, where an incentive is provided to save and invest, and all those entirely desirable and worthwhile actions. Such people argue that it is precisely because the principal private residence and, indeed, the goldmining companies, are free of taxes and otherwise favourably considered in the taxation cum welfare system that those areas of our economy are booming, whereas the rest of it is sluggish, to say the least. They argue from that that the freedom from tax in these areas encourages savings and that, if only for that reason, we should not be subjecting the goldmining industry to taxation but rather should be equalising things by removing company tax before anything else. That is the way the argument runs. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the argument is that we should level the playing field not by removing this lump on it-the goldmining industry-but by building up the rest of the playing field to the same level as the bump. I think that there is a certain attractiveness about that point of view at first sight, although perhaps when one comes to examine it the attraction is less apparent in practice. One minor problem about an approach of that kind is that company tax revenue is estimated in the Budget to yield $10.2 billion this year. If one were to follow the approach advocated by the advocates and abolish company tax entirely, thereby putting every other industry on a par with the goldmining industry, one would have to find, other things being equal, $10.2 billion in revenue from somewhere else, or cut spending by $10.2 billion. I would be in favour of the second option, of course; nevertheless, it does not exactly figure in the views of these advocates. They do not generally put forward a list of $10.2 billion worth of expenditure cuts to finance such a proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to disappoint the Minister, but I have not time today to supply them to him. I do not want, however, to rubbish that kind of argument entirely because it can be argued that a so-called fully integrated system of company tax-one whereby tax is payable not at the company level itself but purely at the shareholder level, but whereby the company actually collects the tax-would in some ways be preferable to the system of imputation that we now have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, I have seen some advertisements from the goldmining industry which have pointed out that the Government itself in its own draft White Paper on tax reform back in 1985 argued a case along those lines. It argued for a fully integrated system of company taxation rather than the imputation system. That is perfectly true. That draft White Paper did so argue. But I have noticed that those advertisements, regrettably in terms of their credibility and perhaps the credibility of those sponsoring them, while noting that there were certain practical difficulties referred to in the draft White Paper when considering the possible choice between the two company tax systems, did not go further into the nature of what those practical difficulties might be. As I say, it is perhaps regrettable that these advertisements have simply glossed over the nature of those practical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into it in too much detail, as I do not have the time, amongst other reasons, the nature of those practical difficulties leads from the fact that if in an economy which is as heavily penetrated by foreign capital as the Australian economy is-in other words, an economy where the equity in our company structure is as considerably in the hands of foreigners, and I am not being xenophobic about this but simply stating a fact, as Australian equity capital in the corporate sector is-we were to remove all company tax, that would of course relieve foreign shareholders of the tax they are presently paying, implicitly or explicitly. We would then have again on a nationwide scale the problem to which I was pointing earlier, and to which Ministers have pointed previously in relation to the particular example of the goldmining industry. We would be simply generalising the problem that has been pointed to concerning the present basis of taxation of the goldmining industry. Having said all that, one might ask why I am opposing this Bill. </PARA>

I stress that I do not disagree with the principle of a level playing field; I only wish the Government would apply that principle a bit more generally. For example, it could apply the principle of a level playing field to the respective positions of export industries on the one hand and import competing industries on the other. In that case our miners and farmers would be benefited, instead of being discriminated against as they are at present because we have a high level of industry protection and all sorts of other elements in our total economic system which discriminate against exporters such as miners and farmers. I will not be diverted further on that particular tack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am opposing this Bill, and more particularly this specific area of the Bill, not for economic reasons or for reasons of taxation principle. I have tried to lay out for the benefit of honourable senators the reasons that the taxation principle in question supports the level playing field concept in this area as in others. I am opposing this Bill for the very simple reason that I believe in politicians keeping their word. I believe it will be very important when we come to the next election that the people of this country remember the importance of electing politicians who will keep their word. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware, as all honourable senators in this place are aware, that prior to the last election the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, promised that the Opposition would not support imposing a company tax on the goldmining industry within the life of the next Parliament-that is, the life of the current Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also made such a promise. The Prime Minister made a promise not in precisely the same words but to the same effect. Of course, the Government is getting around that promise; it is weaselling on that promise by introducing the measure but making it effective as from 1 January 1991, which will not be within the life of the present Parliament because, constitutionally, that would be beyond the last possible time for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say in passing that the post-dating of this provision will have some bad effects on the goldmining industry. There is almost two years to go before that provision will come into effect and there is not the slightest doubt that that hiatus will encourage goldminers to maximise their incomes over the current financial year and in 1989-90 and 1990-91. At least for half of that time they will still be on a non-company tax paying basis. They will maximise their income during that time in order to minimise their tax by mining their richest ore. I do not pretend to be a mining expert but even I know that that is not good mining practice. One does not haul out the richest pockets of ore, because doing it all at once, or more rapidly than would otherwise occur, shortens the life of the mine and results in leaving otherwise minable ore in the ground-ore which could be taken out along with rich ore but which, if left there on its own, is no longer rich enough to mine. It is bad mining practice.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government, by this post-dated provision, is condemning the goldmining industry to two years of bad mining practice. The Government may say that it is not condemning the goldmining industry to this because, after all, it does not have to behave in that way; but the Government is certainly applying a very strong and powerful stimulus and incentive to the mining industry to behave in that manner. I have very little doubt that many mines will be operated in that way and that will be a loss to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the attitude I finally bring to the vote, I hope later this evening, is that I believe very strongly in the need for political leaders to keep their promises. We have had too many political leaders in this country-I have to say that it has come from both sides of the political spectrum; I do not want to be unfair in that regard-who have not kept their promises. Given the promise made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election that the Government would not impose a company tax on the goldmining industry during the life of the present Parliament, I believe it profoundly important that that promise should be kept. I shall certainly be voting with my colleagues on this side to see that the Government does so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a contribution to this debate, not least because of Senator Walsh's rather intemperate outburst about those people who have argued against the Government's measure to extend company income tax to those companies which are mining gold. In view of his classification of those who oppose this tax as spivs and bludgers-I think that was the expression used-and in light of the fact that the Western Australian members of the Liberal Party of Australia have been fairly active in pursuing the decision that was arrived at by the Opposition, I should like to make a brief contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who is at the table, that the concerns he has had about anyone who opposes the imposition of corporate tax on goldmining companies and the anger and abuse he has expressed are rather odd, given the recent history of his own Government on this question. I have in front of me that Government's Commonwealth Record which states:</PARA>
<PARA>16 December 1986-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, just under two years ago-</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, the Hon. P J Keating, and the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, announced today that the Government had decided not to remove the income tax exemption available to the goldmining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that this announcement was made just after the Government had received a report from Mr Gutman recommending the imposition of the tax. The statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government had concluded that the importance of encouraging active exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the gold mining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be fair to say that Senator Stone in the speech he has just concluded set out the economic arguments which are in favour of removing the exemption. He followed that with a statement as to why he would vote against this particular measure. I do not wish to comment on or detract from the arguments which he has put. I simply observe that it was not only in December 1986 but also as recently as July 1987 that one of the most senior Ministers, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, advised the Industries Assistance Commission in similar terms in a letter which I think was introduced into the debate by Senator Tony Messner who was leading for the Opposition. Senator Button used exactly the same expressions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government decided not to introduce a gold tax because the importance of encouraging exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the gold mining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>We are, of course, talking about an exemption which goes back to the 1920s. In 1986 the Government took the view that the removal of the exemption was not in our national interest because of, among other things, the export significance. In that context, now that we have the benefit of hindsight, it is interesting to see the export record of the gold industry. If we look at what has been produced in terms not of value but of weight, we will see that 91,000 kilograms of gold were produced in Australia in 1986-87 compared with 65,000 kilograms in 1985-86 and 49,000 kilograms in 1984-85. There has been a near doubling of gold production in just two years. Exports of gold have increased just as rapidly. Gold exports in 1985-86 amounted to $774m; in 1986-87, $1,552m; and in 1987-88, $2,562m. In other words, the value of gold exports has more than trebled in just two years. In real terms gold exports increased from $653m in 1985-86 to $1,032m in 1986-87 and $1,560m in 1987-88. So in two years real gold exports have increased 2.3 times. In the September quarter gold exports in real terms jumped to $518m, or more than 6 per cent of total exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Were we debating this measure in a situation of comparative comfort with respect to our balance of payments, it might be a little easier to understand the change of mind which has overtaken the Government in the last 12 months. Were we in a situation where the circumstances were markedly different to those which led the Treasurer, Mr Keating, to say that we were headed for a banana republic status, one might have more understanding of the Government's thinking. Just last week we were advised that in gross terms our foreign debt had reached $120 billion with our net debt at $93 billion. The current account deficit for the first four months of 1988-89 was $5.4 billion, which is almost 60 per cent of the $9.5 billion Budget forecast for the year. Those figures are bad enough, but the most worrying thing about them is that they have occurred just after we have been told by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that Australia's terms of trade have recovered to an extent where they are better than they have been for a decade. If we examine the figures which underlie the cash figures which measure our imports and our exports, we get an absolutely terrifying situation. The truth is that the gap between what we buy and what we sell is growing. The apparent improvement since 1986, banana republic year, is not in terms of the physical movement of goods and services but in the terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance was not one who ranted about the terms of trade quite as much as the Treasurer. There was a long period when we could not hear the Treasurer speak without hearing him refer to the terms of trade. They were the father, the mother, the foster parent and the wholesale producer of our economic difficulties. Mr Keating became a bore on the issue of our terms of trade, to the extent that he educated the whole of the Australian public to understand that that was important. He seems to have been surprisingly silent on the subject over the last year and a half. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that the advance of our terms of trade, the improvement-which was not predicted by anybody I met in private enterprise, in the bureaucracy or in politics-is the real reason for the comparative ease of mind that exists at least in big business circles in this country and perhaps in the minds of some senior Ministers. If one examines what is happening to our merchandise trade, one sees that it is a terrifying prospect for this country. I do not believe that the Minister for Finance would deny that we face a significantly difficult situation, which means that if the price of our commodities declines again we will be in an even more difficult situation than we were in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because it is part of a pattern of failure on the part of this Government with respect to our economic fundamentals. If one looks at our inflation rate, wages growth, productivity growth and interest rates, one finds a horrifying picture of an uncompetitive country. I will not weary the Senate with the details of the figures which I have before me, but it is fair to say that we are usually half as bad again as anybody else and often twice as bad again. I will not weary the Senate with the lamentable productivity of some of our key service areas such as the waterfront. The fact is that we are a country with very significant difficulties. The reasons which the Treasurer gave in 1986 for believing that it would be unhelpful to tax gold remain true today and, in my view, even more so. The figures speak for themselves. The Government's strategy in that sense of encouraging a rapidly growing export industry has proved to be true. I do not need to labour the point because Senator Stone, at the end of his speech, clearly made the practical points which go to why an imposition of such a tax will have some influence. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not like to be classified as a spiv and a bludger because one adopts a position on a matter which has been held by all parties in this place since, I think, 1921. One should not respond to the Minister and his extravagance of expression. However, let me quote a person who, admittedly from a position of interest, has put, in a cool and calm way, the position of the gold industry with respect to gold tax. I refer to Sir Arvi Parbo, who is, I think, widely admired not just on my side of politics but, I suspect, on the Government side of politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I like the Minister's interjections of how disgraceful everybody is. Everybody is disgraceful who disagrees with this Minister. I will quote from a passage of Sir Arvi Parbo's Chairman's address to Western Mining Corporation Holdings Ltd, which was, of course, an address by a chairman of a major goldminer and, therefore, clearly from that perspective. If the Minister is prepared to classify Sir Arvi Parbo as a spiv and a bludger, I suspect that he will get little comfort from his colleagues. Sir Arvi Parbo said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are from time to time asked why gold companies think they should be exempt from paying tax when everyone else has to pay it. This question is based on a wide misunderstanding of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Gold companies pay all the usual taxes except corporation tax and shareholders pay full income tax on dividends arising out of gold mining profits. Other companies pay corporation tax, but are then able to pass on an imputation credit to shareholders who receive a corresponding credit against their income tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not that the gold mining industry does not pay tax. Gold companies and their shareholders taken together pay income tax through a system which is very close to the so-called integration method of corporate taxation, as compared with the alternative imputation method which is presently applied to all other industry. The only departure from the integration method is that shareholders of gold mining companies pay tax on retained earnings only when those earnings are distributed as dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1985 White Paper on taxation prepared by the Federal Government both methods were discussed. The conclusion was that while the full integration method was the only ideal approach to corporate taxation, there were practical difficulties in implementing it. The imputation system would provide an appropriate basis for extension to a full integration system when the practical difficulties were eventually adequately resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The integration method as now applied to gold mining has the advantage that undistributed company profits are not taxed in the first instance. Such profits are invariably applied towards further development and investment, and more funds are therefore available from internal company resources for these vital purposes. Encouragement of more investment in productive activities is, as we all know, absolutely essential for the future of Australia. The undistributed profits will not go untaxed, because additional dividends and capital gains resulting from reinvestment are taxed in shareholders' hands when received. </PARA>
<PARA>The final two paragraphs I wish to quote are these:</PARA>
<PARA>The dramatic expansion of the Australian gold mining industry during the 1980's would not have occurred if this positive taxation regime had not applied. Continuation of this regime is essential if gold mining is to make an ongoing and increasing contribution to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The gold mining industry is not asking to be privileged through not paying tax. It argues that the present system applied to gold mining, which encourages and facilitates re-investment of a part of the profits in the industry, is in Australia's interests. It argues that it is in Australia's interests to extend this system, and therefore the same encouragement of investment to all Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA>That ends the quotation from Sir Arvi Parbo. The truth of the matter is that Australia faces a most difficult future with respect to its export situation. I think we face a most difficult situation with respect to our balance of payments. We maintain a taxation system which is biased against investment in favour of consumption. I think that this measure which is proposed by the Government will further shift the bias of the system in that direction. I do not believe that that is the direction in which we should move. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister for Finance that when he introduced dividend imputation one might, if one had the same approach to politics as he, have engaged in all sorts of mud slinging about the Government's operating with respect to the help it was giving its big business mates. I would remind the Minister that we supported that dividend imputation as a means of reducing the double taxation of earnings, which has been a feature of the Australian company tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that the goldmining industry is closer to the ideal that we would seek for Australian industry. It is a pity that we should wish to move in the other direction. I commend the Opposition's amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating three Bills: the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill, which incorporates various amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act; the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), which is an annual Bill about taxation rates; and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2), which changes various sales tax rates and classifications. This is a cognate debate for those three Bills. There are two Government amendments which I will be moving in the committee stages to two of the Bills. There is an Opposition amendment to the second reading motion, which, of course, the Government will be opposing, and an Opposition amendment to the commencement date of one of the particular changes in the Sales Tax Bill. The Australian Democrats will also wheel up on the Sales Tax Bill a couple of the same amendments that they have wheeled up for every Sales Tax Bill since 1984. Of course, there is the big amendment, which is identified as 492 and is to be moved by the Opposition. The effect of it would be to continue an uneven playing field to the mining industry; that is, to continue the exemption from corporate taxation which the goldmining industry has had since 1924.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting the real reason why that exemption was granted. It is probably one of the many things which Winston Churchill has to answer for. He took England back onto the gold standard in 1924 at the pre-war rate, which meant that sterling was grossly overvalued. Australia, which was pegged to sterling at that time, followed suit. The goldmining industry in Australia was placed in extreme difficulties and the reaction was to exempt goldmining from corporate income tax. It was one of those knee-jerk, foolish reactions which unfortunately has taken 64 years to correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 14 1/2 years that I have been a member of this place, I cannot remember supporting any piece of legislation with more enthusiasm than I support the ending of the goldmining rort. It has polluted the political process in Australia for as long as I can remember. The workers in the goldmining industry have always paid tax on their wages. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Stone made quite a worthy contribution to the debate. He presented a mostly rational argument. In particular, he elaborated on matters about which he has a good deal of technical expertise. He spoke about international taxing arrangements under which, he conceded, United States equity holders in Australian goldmining ventures effectively pay the tax in Washington that they do not pay in Australia. It was very hard to tell which side of the debate he was on. In the end he had to put up an elaborate but very unconvincing rationalisation for a fundamentally indefensible position-that is, that he was going to stick with the Opposition on this issue. Senator Maguire suggested that Senator Stone believed that Australia should be running a foreign aid program for the United States. With all due respect to Senator Maguire, I do not believe that is correct. I think Senator Stone knows very well that, even though the Reagan Administration has done enormous damage to the United States economy, the United States has not reached the stage of being a Third World country and therefore a worthy recipient of Australian foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone also dealt with-and I probably received some of the letters that he has-those people who have argued essentially that there should be no corporate taxation in Australia at all. This is an argument which I believe is not entirely without merit, among other reasons because of the extent to which corporate taxes are passed on to consumers. Most of the serious work that I have read on this subject suggests that probably two-thirds of corporate taxation is passed on to consumers. I make this point because it is of some importance. That sort of conclusion is substantially valid if we are dealing with a manufacturing company or a company engaged in retail trade. It is, however, quite different for those companies which are producing products the price of which is determined by export parity, which by and large are in extractive industries. They are price takers. The prices that are received are set by forces outside Australia. Gold is clearly an extractive industry. Whatever the case may be for abolishing corporate taxation across the board for non-extractive industries or industries which do not have their prices determined by external forces, there is no case for having no taxation at all for companies engaged in the production of commodities, particularly in extractive industries, when the prices for their products are set by external forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Boswell that this is a fact which is obviously recognised by the Queensland Government. I recall that in, I believe, 1986 at the Northern Australian Development Forum one of Senator Boswell's friends, Mr Katter Jr, delivered a passionate tirade about the stupidity of taxing income derived from goldmining. He said that there were dozens of projects throughout Queensland involving the investment of billions of dollars and that the only thing that was holding them up was the fear that the stupid socialist Government in Canberra would impose a tax on gold. I spoke immediately after Mr Katter. I said I was very interested in his remarks. If it was such a stupid idea to impose a tax on goldmining, I wondered why the Queensland Government was doing it-which it was, which it always has done and which it continues to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney suggests expediting legislation when we had 30-odd speakers, almost all of them from the Opposition, on the Appropriation Bills and 17 on this package of Bills. With the exception of a very good two-minute contribution from Senator McKiernan and my summary, all the speakers have been from the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The spurious argument has been put to me in correspondence and again tonight that, with the imputation system in operation, the fact that goldmining companies are exempt from corporate taxation really does not matter. This was put by Mr Tuckey on 9 November on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation program in Canberra in response to a question about `goldmining being a tax avoiding industry'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I mean the other factor that of course has arisen which keeps getting ignored is that the circumstances for the gold industry have changed substantially with imputation. I mean the reality of imputation is that tax on company profits is now only paid once. It is either paid by the company and the credit is passed on to the dividend earner or it is paid by the person receiving the dividend if the company is unable to give evidence to the Tax Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the same line has been run by a gaggle of spivs and bludgers who wrote to me about this, putting the same argument. That shows that they are stupid as well. They are particularly stupid if they think that I would fall for such a phoney argument. Of course, the first and obvious response to that argument is, if what they are saying is true, that the tax is paid anyway, why are they squealing? They are squealing because they believe, probably correctly, that they can take the retained profits as a capital gain through selling their shares and thereby get a concessional rate of tax. They also believe that the Opposition, should it be elected to government, would let them off paying any capital gains tax provided that they hold the shares for five years. Of course, it is declared Opposition policy to let them off in that way; the people who are punting on that are correct about that leg of the proposition. What they are not correct about is the assumption that the Opposition will be in government to implement its policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The greed of these people who hold shares in goldmining companies that employ people who have always paid tax on their wages is not surprising. But I do find it an affront that they also indulge in what is really economic treachery, for the reasons that Senator Stone set out-that is, that foreigners who own equity in Australian goldmining companies pay overseas, particularly in the United States, the tax that they are exempted from paying in Australia. As much as $70m a year in taxation is being paid overwhelmingly in Washington rather than in Australia because this absurd taxation law has persisted for 64 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Joint ventures are precisely what I am talking about. The major equity in the Telfer joint venture is, I think, held by an American mining company which puts up its money, pays its tax in Washington but pays nothing in Australia. The argument can be developed that we should have gone to the United States and said, `What about renegotiating the double taxation agreement?' The first problem with that is that it would take about two years at the very least just to get through the negotiating process. More importantly, what would happen if we were to go to the United States and say, `Look, we have this crazy taxation system in Australia which taxes corporate income derived from everything other than gold and we want you to fix it up for us by agreeing to a very much larger dividend withholding tax on profits repatriated to the United States companies which have equity'? Do those opposite know what I would do if I were an American? I would say, `Clear out, do not come pulling my leg. Do not ask me to bend over backwards to fix up Australia's idiotic taxation laws'. That is what the Americans would say. They might say it a bit more politely, but essentially that is what they would say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth about investment is, of course, that there has been no major goldmining project in Australia for many years which has not factored into its economic viability assessment corporate tax at a 49c rate, not the 39c rate the companies now face. I am very glad that Senator Chaney mentioned Western Mining Corporation, because I had a conversation with Hugh Morgan in 1985 about the subject of tax exemption of the goldmining industry. Hugh Morgan said, `We realise that there will be a tax on goldmining profits and, of course, there has to be a tax on goldmining profits'. I know that Western Mining is singing a different tune now, but that is what Hugh Morgan said in 1985 and that is what every rational goldminer in Australia has known and factored into its economic viability assessments for at least the last 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition is going to move an amendment, the effect of which would be to restore the anomaly that has survived for 64 years. It knows it will be defeated because the Australian Democrats have indicated they are going to vote with the Government. This raises the question of what the Opposition does in the unlikely event of its being elected to government. I cannot get an answer from Mr Howard or Dr Hewson or Mr Peacock or anybody about that. But let me make this prediction: should the Opposition be elected to government, it will wheel up in 1991 or thereabouts a Bill to implement the amendments it has foreshadowed tonight, knowing full well that that Bill will be knocked off in the Senate, because there is no way that the Liberal Party and the National Party, should they get a majority in the House of Representatives at the next election, could get a majority in the Senate.

<PARA> ``2. (1) Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Division 6 of Part III commences, or shall be taken to have commenced, as the case requires, on 1 January 1989.''. </PARA>
<PARA>It had been assumed that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988 would be proclaimed by 1 January. It is now possible that the Bill will not be proclaimed by 1 January. Should that occur, under the imputation arrangements and because of the difference in the 39c and 49c tax rates applying, companies could gain an unintended advantage from the fact that the Bill may not be proclaimed on 1 January. That is the essentiality of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The date of effect for these provisions will be 1 January 1989 rather than the date on which the amending Act receives royal assent. That is the critical clause. The amendment is necessary because there is now no certainty that the Bill containing the transitional provisions will receive royal assent prior to 1 January 1989. The transitional imputation provisions will prevent franked dividends paid by early balancing companies with imputation credits that are calculated on the basis of the 39 per cent company tax rate from being channelled through later balancing companies to be subsequently credited at the 49 per cent company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will ensure that franked dividends paid by early balancing companies during the period between 1 January 1989 and the day on which the amending Act receives royal assent will be subject to the same requirements as those paid on and after the day of royal assent. This amendment will prevent any revenue loss that might arise if royal assent does not occur before 1 January 1989. It will also, of course, ensure equality of treatment for companies within the financial year regardless of the date upon which they are paid. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 3, paragraphs 9 (b) and (c), lines 26 to 29, leave out the paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, this amendment is in opposition to subclauses 9 (b) and 9 (c) of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5). The amendment of these two subclauses reflects the opposition which the Liberal and National parties will be expressing, in voting against clause 9, to the gold tax which we have been discussing during the second reading debate. Votes will be taken on other clauses a little later as they are considered in the committee stage. This amendment is merely the commencement of that exercise as these two subclauses are mentioned very early in the amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We canvassed at great length during the second reading debate the arguments against the introduction of a gold tax in Australia. As the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) pointed out during the second reading debate, the goldmining industry has been exempted from paying corporate tax for many years. Taxation is paid by shareholders on dividends that they receive from companies that mine gold. A capital gains tax is payable in respect of any profits that are earned from buying and selling shares in goldmining companies. In fact, that contributes very significantly to the coffers of the Commonwealth by virtue of those taxes alone. There are, of course, other State taxes, other royalties and so on, payable to State governments. Most States are in some way touched by this proposal, but it is particularly Western Australia which has such a heavy investment in goldmining that is mostly concerned about the non-exemption of the goldmining industry that will apply from now on if this Bill is accepted by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reasons for opposing this tax, in summary form, are very simply expressed. Firstly, we believe that the industry is in a very strong growth phase which is of significant benefit to Australia. In the last four or five years the total operating revenue of the goldmining industry has quadrupled from around $600m a year to around $2,500m a year. Also there has been a very significant change in the export of gold, which has quadrupled. The sale of gold on the overseas markets has helped us significantly with the balance of payments problem we have at present. Without that we would be perhaps in a greater pickle than we are at the moment with a huge overseas debt of some $120,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> The gold industry is a vital industry. It is growing fast. As I said, its revenue has quadrupled in the last four or five years. Employment in the industry has skyrocketed from about 2,000 in 1984 to about 7,500 in the current year, so it is a significant employer of Australians, all over the continent. This development is not only occurring in the big towns and cities; it is occurring in the outback and in the remoter parts of Australia. This development is generating future growth and opportunities for Australia. Those are the significant economic facts of life. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a significant improvement in our balance of payments being brought about by this development. This is no more clearly demonstrated than by considering the following statistic which shows what is happening with this industry. We have all been used to the fact that industries such as wheat, wool, coal and iron ore have been significant contributors to the export income of this country over many years. They have been the backbone of the development of our export industries. Going back some four or five years, gold featured on the list of Australian exports in about tenth position. Today it has reached No. 3 on the list of this country's exports. In fact, it runs just behind coal and wool. It has become our third biggest export. It is a vitally significant industry at a time when there is a demand for the product, when there is a capacity to produce in this country and when investment is flowing into it. And now we find that the Government wants to chop it off at the knees by imposing a higher tax regime on it. It plainly does not make economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> That has not just been demonstrated by arguments put by members of the Liberal and National parties during the debate over the last day or so, but has also been brought to the Government's attention through various studies that have been undertaken by significant consultants such as Ernst and Whinney and J. B. Were and Son. Those studies have demonstrated that the Government will lose taxation revenue as a result of the introduction of a gold tax. It will happen because the gold industry, if taxed, will stop growing in this country. It will not employ people at the rate that it has been employing them over the last several years. It will not grow in terms of overall revenue. It will not, therefore, be generating and multiplying its way through the economy to create jobs in other industries. We will not see growth in export income as a result. We will not see a contribution to our balance of payments problems as a result. We are facing today no greater crisis than our balance of payments, yet this stupid Hawke-Keating Government wants to chop off the industry at the knees to try to bring some kind of abstract taxation theory into force. It is just plain nonsense. It defeats all commonsense-all plain thinking-and consequently it does not deserve the Committee's support. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be opposing all clauses in the Bill that seek to institute the goldmining tax. We believe that it is wrong in principle and in practice. The Government has not put forward, either in the second reading speech or at any time in the course of the argument of the last two days, any debating point of significance in support of the tax. Not one argument has been advanced. All arguments that have been put forward by the Minister-he is the only one from the other side who has spoken-have been in rebuttal of arguments put forward by this side. No point in positive support of this tax has emanated from the Government side. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is a great thing. What that means is that the Government will have further capital gains tax flowing into the coffers. That supports my point. That demonstrates growth in this industry. It means more investment, more jobs, more production and a better balance of payments result. That is precisely what we ought to be encouraging. Senator Maguire wants to stop it. That is his whole approach to life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some 19 honourable senators have spoken to the Bill dealing with the gold tax. I can inform honourable senators of the breakdown: 16 Liberal and National Party senators have spoken; two members of the Australian Democrats have spoken; and only one senator would stand up on behalf of the Government to defend this nonsense. One senator from the Government side has been prepared to support it, out of 19 speakers. Where are the Western Australian senators from the Labor side? Why are they not pouring through the doors to speak to the Bill? We have not seen them. Where are those honourable senators who are interested in pure economics? We have not even seen Senator Maguire on his feet on this issue. As Senator Puplick said the other day, Senator Maguire is the kind of person who would come in and defend the Massacre of the Innocents: but he did not defend the gold tax, nor would he, because he knows that it is economic stupidity. He will admit that. He had to do a deal with Mr Bannon, the South Australian Premier, to get the Roxby Downs operation under way. We know what that was all about. He went cold on the idea until 1991. Now he has to pay the piper and give him a gold tax. That is what it is all about. There has been a deal about Roxby Downs and other operations throughout Australia for the last several years. Let us not have any hypocrisy from Senator Maguire about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The point about all this is quite simple. The economic rationale for this tax does not stand up. No Government senator, bar the Minister, will stand up and defend the issue. He has not put forward one positive reason at all for the tax. In the House of Representatives Mr Keating was not able to advance one reason whatsoever for the tax. If one looks at the statement he brought down last May when he introduced the tax, one sees that there was no argument in support of it. It is purely a figment of some Government person's mentality and, quite clearly, it deserves to be defeated. We, in the Liberal and National parties, will be vigorously opposing all clauses relating to the gold tax. We invite the Democrats to join with us so that we can defeat this Bill, get rid of this nonsense, and get on with governing Australia properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the remarks made by Senator Messner. I will not go over all the points raised by him, but there are a few matters I would like to raise at some time in the committee stage to which I would like Senator Walsh to reply. They are an overview of what this gold tax is all about. The first question is: why bring in legislation for a tax now which will be applicable in 1991? The effect of that action is no different from Senator Walsh telling financial institutions what the exchange rate will be, or what the interest rate will be, in 1991. Senator Maguire kept interjecting before about the gold tax going up 18 points today.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The net result of flagging a tax that is not going to apply between now and 1991 is that the miners who can will high grade. It is no good criticising them for this, but it is simply because the Government is flagging now something that will happen in 1991. I can see Senator Maguire nodding because I think he knows this will happen. This high grading means that those people who purchased and owned shares before September 1985-I think that is when capital gains tax came in-will be holding onto those shares because of the high grading process. This means, simply on the demand and supply for shares, that there are fewer shares on the market than there normally would be because of this legislation. That is the distortion it causes and I wonder, when Senator Walsh replies, whether he will give me the reasons as to why at this stage the Government would do a silly thing like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other comment I wish to make is that Senator Walsh, in his speech on the second reading, referred to the fact that he did not have any objection in principle to a tax system which encouraged savings investment rather than consumption. I think a lot of people would agree with him on that. But he made some differentiation between goldminers, whom he called price takers--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister did say that. He made the point that goldminers were price takers and not price makers. One can understand this tax system applying to price makers rather than price takers. I had great difficulty coming to grips with that because, in the absence of a monopoly, I would imagine that all producers of whatever is being produced are price takers and not price makers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other comment I wished to make was this: Senator Walsh has mentioned, on a number of occasions, the concern he has, and one of the major reasons for the introduction of this gold tax is that moneys end up in foreign treasuries, for example, in the United States instead of the Australian Treasury. I think this is a retrograde step and we will find out in a year or two just how retrograde it is in regard to future mines, not existing mines that might continue until costs exceed revenue. What I could not understand with any degree of wit was why the Government could not have just introduced a simple amendment, if that is what the problem was. A simple amendment would have meant that dividends paid overseas to foreign companies which are not taxable here would attract a withholding tax equal to the tax they would pay if dividends were distributed in Australia, bearing in mind that we do have an offset. We have Australians who invest in the United States who do not pay the full tax, because in the United States there are two very hefty taxes; one is a Federal tax and the other is State taxes. By having investments in the United States they avoid paying the State taxes. Therefore, when the money comes back here, presumably they get the benefit that would also flow from the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the major points I wished to raise. As I said in my opening remarks, I would not go over the ground covered both in the second reading speech and in the comments made by Senator Messner. I think they are very important points to which I would like to hear the answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the amendment which Senator Messner has just moved, as he made very clear, seeks to perpetuate the unlevel playing field-that is, the exemption from corporate taxation of one industry alone. Of course, the Government will not accept the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer asked a couple of questions which deserve an answer and they will get one. He asked why the commencement date is 1991. I thought I had covered that in my second reading reply. Senator Parer might not have been here when I made those comments. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in almost identical terms, gave an undertaking that there would be no tax on corporate profits derived from goldmining during the life of this Parliament. That is the reason for the 1991 commencement date. I think it is a fair argument if the honourable senator wants to be critical about the date being 1991. In fact, I would probably agree with him. But I have made the point that this issue has polluted the Australian political process for 64 years and that is just one of the products of that pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the taxation of up to $70m being paid in Washington instead of Australia, Senator Parer asked what superficially seems to be a very reasonable question; that is, why do we not just have a withholding tax on dividends repatriated from the United States equal to the Australian corporate tax rate? I also dealt with this matter in my second reading reply. That would require a change to the double taxation agreement with the US and, therefore, a renegotiation of that agreement which, under any circumstances, would take a considerable amount of time but to which in this case, I suggest, the US would be unlikely to agree. Why should the United States bend over backwards to put an extraordinary sort of clause into a double taxation agreement in order to compensate for the distortions caused by a tax law in Australia? I would be extremely surprised if there were the same sort of tax law for any industry in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza held up his hand when I was speaking in the second reading debate and I misunderstood what he was signifying. I thought when he held up his hand he was signifying that he did not have shares in goldmining companies. He has since told me privately that he was signifying that he does have shares in goldmining companies. I pass no moral judgment about that but I misunderstood his signal and I want to set the record straight. </PARA>

I am not quite sure what relevance that question has to the measure that is before the chamber. If Senator Panizza wants to talk about profits of goldmining companies-if that is the purpose of his question-let me say that that last time I looked at the figures, which was two weeks ago now, gold was selling on the London Metals Exchange for about $A520. We know from departmental research that the cost on average of producing an ounce of gold in Australia was $300. We are looking at a cool $250-odd profit for each ounce of gold produced in Australia on average. By any stretch of the imagination, that is not a bad cop.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will repeat those questions that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) did not hear. Can the Minister give me an approximation of the extra collections if corporate tax on gold came in on, say, 1 July, allowing for the fact that tax is already collected on unfranked dividends in Australia and that all dividends on goldmining companies are untaxed because they do not pay corporate tax? Allowing for that, and also allowing for the two-way agreement with foreign dividends which we have between Australia and the United States and between Australia and other countries-there is a 15 per cent withholding tax, contrary to what Senator Walsh said; they are not completely free-can the Minister give me such an approximation? To change a system that has lasted since 1924 is a big turnaround and a big disincentive to further exploration. That has already been shown in the downturn in exploration in Kalgoorlie, as the Minister knows. Exploration is about 20 per cent lower than it was this time last year. All of those things are affected, and I would like to know the figure. That is the end of those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of explanation, the reason I asked whether the Minister knew how much goldmining companies lost between 1938 and 1974 was to show that they need this preferential treatment that they have been getting since gold has not been taxed because they have had preferential punishment between 1938 and 1984. Can the Minister tell me of any other export products whose prices were fixed between 1938 and 1974?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just follow on from my colleague Senator Panizza. Under the gold tax system as it now exists, there is a great incentive for equity rather than debt. I notice with interest that Senator Haines is here; this is something that she feels strongly about. I wonder whether any calculations have been done. If so, what are the results of those calculations to show just what the change in tax will be? My reason for asking this and showing my hand is that I have seen calculations. If I have seen them, I hope the Government has done calculations to get the same sorts of results, because once this system comes in-bearing in mind that between now and 1991 we are going to get a massive high grading where possible, and bearing in mind that under the current system where tax is payable in the hands of the shareholders, because they are unfranked dividends, and for shares bought after September 1985 there is a capital gains tax on shares sold-there is going to be a tremendous move to go from equity into debt. I hope the Government has done its homework on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we went from zero debt, which would be the norm today in most companies, because there has been no reason for them to have deductions, to, say, 60 per cent debt, and then add to that all the other deductions for depreciation and so on, what would be the net effect in revenue to the Government by moving to this system? I believe that the chance is that over a period there will be a negative return to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already been pulled into line by the Temporary Chairman. I cannot engage in badinage across the chamber any more. I must direct my attention to the question. We calculate that the yield from extending normal company tax to the goldmining industry, closing off the gold loophole, will be about $300m per annum. Senator Panizza's question was: if we were then to deduct what might be obtained by tax imputation being reduced as a consequence, the balance would be. I cannot give him that figure. I would again be entering into the realms of speculation if I were to do so, and he might quite rightly upbraid me for venturing thus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say though, in respect of the allegations that he-or was it Senator Parer?-made about high grading, and in Senator Parer's case, the question on exploration, that the Commonwealth may well have made a grievous miscalculation and be dudding our revenue by introducing this measure. That was the import of the question. We do not believe that will be so. If the honourable senator is right, then his arguments about it being a brake on incentive and a brake on development would be wrong. If he is right, then the goldmining industry in Australia is going to have an enhanced incentive to further develop, and all the foredoomings and forebodings made in contributions to the second reading debate would be right past the point and would be providing an incentive to the industry. This is a logical extension from the premises inherent in the questions of Senator Parer. The honourable senator may find it uncomfortable, but that is a logical extension. Therefore, perhaps it is not in his best interests to pursue the argument. That is all I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the point is that I do not think we are dudding our base. Even if we were to accept the Opposition's view that in the short term we were, in the long term, by giving equal treatment to the mining and sale of this metal that is enjoyed by the miners and sellers of all other metals, we would at least be establishing the equity considerations that are inherent in our position. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other observation. If Senator Panizza's forecasts are true about high grading, then I am sure that he will use his influence in the conservative coalition to address that concern to the governments of the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. We have to exempt South Australia from this, because that is the only other State in which there is an explicit gold tax. Those States apply a production or a profits based tax. If members of the Opposition are concerned about a gold tax, then their fire should be directed to those who apply it and not to the Commonwealth, which extends company tax to the gold industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook has given the answer that it was $300m gross. I would not be surprised if that was wrong. Senator Cook did not seem to know much about the subject. The fact is that is the figure that has been given to the Committee. I am asking the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who is hopefully better at arithmetic, what the net figure is. I do not know whether Senator Walsh was listening, but Senator Cook seemed to have a very simplistic way of estimating the profits from the gold tax. He said, `Well, gold now is selling for $A500 and something and the cost of producing it is $300 and something, so one can see what a great profit there is'. He does not seem to have regard to the fact that in the first place under this legislation companies will be able to carry forward from the date of the May statement this year the various deductions that would be available to them. They will be carrying forward from May 1988 to January 1991-a period of 2 1/2 years-a very solid amount of deductions. I would like to know, firstly, when those deductions work themselves out because clearly there will no profit at all in the 1990-91 tax year. When will the Government expect to start recovering any sort of gain from this tax? Secondly, has the Government made estimates of what will be, on a continuing basis, the various deductions that will be available annually, such as interest payments, depreciation payments and exploration costs, all of which will be deductable once a tax has been imposed? Thirdly, I ask the Minister: What will be the set-off against whatever the net result of that is from the loss of tax on dividends? As companies will be paying franked dividends, presumably in most cases, there will be a loss of tax on dividends and there will also be a loss on capital gains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner has indicated that some calculations have been made on this score by Ernst and Whinney and J. B. Were and Son. Whatever the Minister thinks of their calculations, the reality is that there will be a considerable loss in capital gains tax because of the depressed value of the market capitalisation of gold shares. Has the Government taken all these matters into consideration in its calculation of the gain, whether it be net or gross? Senator Cook has departed the chamber. He talked about gross gains. I think he probably did not understand what he was talking about. Has the Government taken into account all the matters that I have indicated? If it has, what is its figure of long term profit from this tax? When will that profit start to come on stream?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to correct one point made by Senator Cook. He said that if he extrapolated my view through to there being a lower return to the Government this would be to the benefit of the companies. What he did not understand, and what apparently the Government does not understand, is that I am talking about new developments, not existing projects which, as I said earlier, will go on until costs exceed revenue. One of the pluses of the existing gold tax as it applies before this legislation comes into place is that the system of forward selling used by the gold industry has been such that in the early stages of a project it has been able to finance the first three to five years of the project. After that it can be off and running, and, I point out to Senator Haines, without going into debt, interestingly enough. This legislation will do away with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To follow up what Senator Durack said, and also to get clarification on the response from Senator Cook, the remark was made that the Government expected the net revenue to be in the order of $300m a year. Has that figure been arrived at on the assumption that the structure of the goldmining companies is unchanged; in other words, that equity will remain almost 100 per cent of the source of funding? If the companies go into 60 or 70 per cent debt, what figure would that be? As Senator Durack has mentioned, to that we must add deductions for depreciation and exploration and all the other deductions that apply under the normal company tax system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two concepts of gross and net here. The first one, which is the one Senator Cook was addressing, is that of corporate tax revenue after making allowance for the carry forward of exploration expenditure prior to calendar year 1991 and for some undeducted other investments. That has been taken into account in the estimate of $300m in a full year. The estimate for the first financial year, which is only half a financial year in reality, is $70m. Because of those carry forwards it will take some time for it to build up to the full figure. The fact that those carry forwards are there and that undeducted other investment which would under general taxation rules have been deductable from taxable income would also be taken into account is, as I acknowledged a while ago, a distortion-and perhaps an unfortunate distortion. But the nettle had to be grasped on this issue at some time or other. It should have been grasped many years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the payout of dividends and tax that would have been collected on that, let me say first that that has no relevance to the dividends that are payable overseas. Around 36 per cent of the equity in Australian goldmines is held by foreigners, and overwhelmingly by the United States. No attempt has been made to estimate those dividends and for a variety of reasons they are unlikely to be very great. Under the old regime there was a very strong incentive to retain profits within goldmining companies for an indefinite period and for people from time to time to sell their shares and pick up a capital gain, instead of taking income, which would have been taxed at a concessional rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point highly relevant to that is that should the Opposition get into government and implement the policies to which it committed itself some time ago, I do not remember exactly when-that is, to abolish the capital gains tax if an asset has been held for more than five years-of course almost everybody would hold goldmining shares for more than five years and then cash them in, receiving in the price of the shares they sold the accumulated untaxed profits of the company and escaping capital gains tax altogether. So it depends largely on what assumptions one makes about what might happen, but if one were to assume that the Opposition's policy on capital gains taxation was implemented, there would be almost no tax levied on dividends anyway because there would be hardly any dividends taken. Earnings would all be taken as capital gains after a five-year period, untaxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument is being put forward-and I have not heard anyone explicitly say this, but it is implicit in a number of comments that have been made-that the effect of this measure will actually be to reduce the amount of tax paid to the Commonwealth. If that were true I would repeat the question I asked in reply to the second reading debate: Why are the people who are affected by it complaining about it?</PARA>

It is perhaps worth looking at what has been happening around the world. Over the last eight years Australian gold production has increased tenfold-that is, 1,000 per cent-from 17 tonnes in 1980 to a projected 189 tonnes in 1989. If we look at the rest of the world we will see that the world supply of mined gold grew by just 13 per cent between 1985 and 1988. That compares with Australia's increase of 1,000 per cent. South Africa has had a decrease of 11 per cent. I accept that South Africa has problems because of the depth of its mines but, with the world prices of gold, its production has decreased by 11 per cent. Canada will increase its production by only 50 per cent and production in the United States will grow by only 33 per cent. Is Senator Walsh going to tell me when he gets to his feet-if that is possible-that the increase in production of gold in Australia is due to the distortion of the tax system? Is it because we have a tax system that induces investment and, therefore, increases production to the level that it has? Of course that is not the case and Senator Walsh knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is not about a level playing field; it is about increasing the tax grab. I am sure that Senator Walsh says it himself: one of the fundamental problems with Australia is our poor levels of investment and saving. Whilst there are distortions in consumption-there are problems with the levels of public sector and private sector consumption-anybody looking objectively at the goldmining industry will accept that the tax system has provided and ensured that there has been a significant increase in capital investment, which is what I would have imagined the Government would have encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that if Senator Walsh is suggesting that those who oppose him have their own agenda or are being politically expedient, I can only assume that he knows his colleagues better than I do; that he is suggesting that Mr Dowding, the Western Australian Premier, and the Labor Cabinet, support a tax on gold. If they do, I can only assume that they would have no objection to a royalty on gold. If they are half sensible, looking at revenue they would say to themselves, `Once this tax is introduced why should the Federal Government get the benefits of it and not a State government?' So why would they not automatically put a royalty on it? I have no doubt that they will do so. This legislation has no merit, no intrinsic justification and no economic rationale. It is simply a further grab by this Government for increased revenue. </PARA>

My concern arises from an answer given by Senator Cook when the suggestion was made that that $300m per annum was a gross figure. I ask Senator Walsh to confirm that and to refer to his statistical background support figures to enable us to get an appreciation of the impact that, for example, the payment of franked dividends would have on that calculation. I ask for the financial impact of the change as a result of the payment of franked dividends. How much would that be? I ask for the financial figure of the impact of the effect that capital gains tax would have. I ask what adjustment was made in respect of the changing of the capital base of a company. I ask for the figures that would relate to the carrying forward of exploration and other expenditures peculiar to the running of the mining industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly in the adjournment debate tonight on the subject of tourism in Tasmania and the remarkable success which the present Tasmanian Liberal Government has achieved in attracting visitors to the State. I am sure that all honourable senators present who have had the opportunity to visit Tasmania would agree that it is a most attractive holiday destination. It is a destination which has suffered somewhat in the past because people may have felt that it was a little laid back and perhaps not as exciting as some of the mainland destinations. However, this has changed as people now know and appreciate that the beautiful scenery, the idyllic lifestyle, and the warm hospitality which Tasmania offers so generously, can certainly be appreciated in its own right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Government, through a number of highly successful initiatives, has promoted tourism to the point where it has become one of the State's major revenue earners. With the recent retirement of the former Minister for Tourism and Deputy Premier, Mr Geoff Pearsall, the State has lost not only a skilful and well-respected politician, but also a wonderful ambassador. I would like therefore to place on record the appreciation of the people of Tasmania for Geoff Pearsall's untiring efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish also, when speaking on tourism in Tasmania, to refer the Senate to the Wrest Point Casino in Hobart which was Australia's first legalised casino. In that regard, Tasmania has led the way. It is a multimillion dollar investment, which has attracted many tourists to the island and with the recent addition of its magnificent convention facilities surely ranks as one of the best of these types of facilities in the world. Honourable senators present would be well aware that it was not so long ago that Wrest Point Casino was chosen twice by the Labor Party as a venue for its national conference. Having spoken to some of its members I know they speak very highly of the facility. Perhaps they might not speak so highly of some of the results of those conferences, but be that as it may, it certainly has proved to be a very wonderful and well-recognised convention facility for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it is particularly disappointing when one who is chosen to represent Tasmania chooses to pursue the path of political opportunism by knocking one's own State. There is the tall poppy syndrome in which successful individuals often find that their success is criticised by others who are all too ready to knock them down. Unfortunately, this type of criticism, which has become part of the Australian phenomenon, was recently levelled by Senator Sanders in this place at the Wrest Point Casino. There is no doubt that much of what Senator Sanders had to say was blatantly untrue. I believe that when one understands that Senator Sanders, although he represents the people of Tasmania, has chosen no longer to make that State his home, one perhaps can understand why he may have got out of touch with what is going on in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wish to refer the Senate to comments made in this place on 3 November, 1988, when Senator Sanders described the Wrest Point Casino as `that giant white phallic symbol on the shoreline'. He went on to say, `It is besmirching the river view of local residents'. As a proud Tasmanian, and one who has noted the promotion of tourism in Tasmania for many years, I would say that to most people, including the promoters of tourism in Tasmania, the casino is certainly not a great white phallic symbol. It is a symbol of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Every video which promotes Tasmania features it significantly. I believe that what he has said is certainly not the majority view of all Tasmanians and is quite untrue. He also claimed that when one entered the Casino all one saw were the Moonah mums and the women from the working class suburbs of Moonah and Glenorchy, mindlessly pulling away at levers on poker machines. There are no poker machines in the casino, as such, and if there are, they certainly do not have handles on them. It is another example of the honourable senator's ignorance of the facts. He also went on to say that the Wrest Point Casino was disturbing the fabric of the Tasmanian community. I believe that this is also untrue. Senator Sanders's comments have not gone unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out previously, they have caused considerable disquiet in Tasmania's tourist industry, which is probably one of Tasmania's major employers. If Senator Sanders has been successful in convincing people that they should not visit Tasmania or the Wrest Point casino, he has really only been successful in costing ordinary Tasmanians their jobs. If that is an achievement of which he is proud, I am particularly disappointed. I believe that all senators in this place should use their time actively to support their own State and to portray their State in a positive and not a negative light. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders's comments have also drawn widespread criticism from professionals in the hospitality industry. I recently received a letter from Mr John Haddad, AM, Managing Director of Federal Pacific Hotels Ltd, who has taken particular exception to Senator Sanders's view of Wrest Point and his inference that Tasmanian casinos were run by organised crime. The letter, from Mr Haddad to Senator Sanders, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Upon my return recently from overseas I read the report in Hansard which contains the remarks you made in the Senate in the course of the debate on the Australian Capital Territory Casino Control Ordinance 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> One expects from ones representatives in Parliament a respect for the truth. This was a quality demonstrably absent from statements made by you on the above occasion and I am bound to record my protest. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very regrettable that you chose to describe Wrest Point so contemptuously and inaccurately. The Wrest Point hotel casino and convention centre is one of the best and most favourably known landmarks in the Commonwealth and is featured consistently in tourism literature. </PARA>
<PARA> My company added the convention facilities on its own initiative some few years ago at a cost of $20 million because it recognised the need to strengthen the tourism infrastructure of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wrest Point complex has made a contribution to the tourist industry of this State and of Australia which is incalculable in dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It has attracted international and national conferences of consequence to Tasmania, the State you purport to represent, and my company is proud of its contribution, so much more worthy of note than your disparaging description. </PARA>
<PARA> I join issue with you also when you claim, allegedly from your own observations, that what one sees at Wrest Point ``is the Moonah mums, the women from the working class suburbs of Moonah and Glenorchy, just mindlessly pulling away at levers on poker machines. It has disrupted the fabric of the community''. </PARA>
<PARA> That statement is patently and demonstrably untrue. There are no poker machines at Wrest Point. There are video gaming machines programmed to play a game strictly in accordance with the rules for the table games approved by the Tasmanian Government. None of them have handles. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the most disgraceful statement you made. Asking the rhetorical question ``Does anyone really sincerely think that the present casinos are not run by organised crime'' you went on to claim ``They (people in organised crime) run the casinos in Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking for my own company which controls two casinos in Australia, I state unequivocally that your claim is without a vestige of truth. It is thoroughly false. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal Hotels is proud of the integrity of its directors, of its staff, and of its casino operations. I remind you that the Australian Federal Police conducted a full investigation into my company, as the operators of the casino proposed for Christmas Island, and gave it a complete clearance. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it a matter of profound regret that a member of the Australian Parliament should so demean himself and his position as you did on the occasion about which I have written. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>John M. Haddad</PARA>
<PARA>Managing Director</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Hotels Limited</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is self-explanatory. I believe that what has happened is an abuse of parliamentary privilege. In the future when someone who represents Tasmania wishes to criticise aspects of that State, he should think about what he is going to say before he puts his mouth into gear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some brief remarks in relation to comments that were made yesterday by Senator Puplick in this chamber about the newly established Australian Film Finance Corporation (AFFC) and its Chairman, Kim Williams. Senator Puplick was right when he said I was editor of the film industry trade magazine Encore, which I was for two years. Earlier in the year I was in the old Parliament House interviewing Gary Punch on the day when he announced the new scheme for the future of film funding in Australia. The old scheme was clearly not working. It was introduced in 1980-81 by the Fraser Government with a tax concession rate of 150 per cent for investment in film production, with a 50 per cent concession on the returns from films. In subsequent years the Labor Government reduced the film concessions to 133:33 and then to 120:20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was clear that the tax concessions were costing the Government an increasing amount of money. There was an increasing dissatisfaction from within the industry that the right sort of product was not being made, that there were rorts within the industry, that the quality of films was not good, that the films that were being made were not commercial, and that there was a gradual decline in production which accompanied the decline in the tax concession rates. However, one good thing about the tax concession rates, in my opinion, was that at least they provided experience to many people in the Australian film industry, experience that would not otherwise have been gained had the tax concessions not been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme which was introduced this year was welcomed by the various industry groups-the Screen Production Association of Australia, the Australian Screen Directors Association, Actors Equity of Australia and the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. Kim Williams, who was then chief executive of the Australian Film Commission, played a critical role in promoting open public discussion on the new model for future assistance to the Australian film industry. He conducted numerous seminars around the country with all film bodies, including the State film bodies. He received a multitude of submissions on the new proposal. A paper was produced from within the Australian Film Commission on the future of film funding and it was circulated widely throughout the industry. When comments were returned from industry groups they were incorporated into the new model. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that there was widespread industry agreement on the new model. The industry itself played a leading role-and a very large role-in fashioning the new scheme. It seems that Senator Puplick forgets this. In fact, I find it quite difficult to pinpoint exactly what Senator Puplick is criticising in relation to the new scheme. He conveniently forgets to mention the cost of the tax concessions to the taxpayer and the loss to government revenue of the 10ba scheme which reached about $150m in its most expensive year. I wonder whether he is saying that any government in which he might be the arts Minister would be prepared to support the loss of $100m annually to government revenue for the sake of Australian film culture. I really doubt that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course production went down as the tax incentives decreased. A year ago the future of film production in this country looked very gloomy. There was great concern that there would be widespread unemployment in the industry if something were not done. Certainly, there has been a delay in establishing the new film funding body but I ask Senator Puplick what is new. The Australian Film Finance Corporation is now operational; it is up and running. I believe that what Senator Puplick said yesterday was clutching at straws. He is critical of the new Film Corporation before it has had a chance to prove itself. He picks on one phrase-that is, `30 per cent private sector participation'. I think he deliberately misunderstands it to find a point of criticism. Thirty per cent private sector participation in the new scheme reflects an attempt by the new Film Corporation to involve the private sector in film funding in this country. The new Film Corporation will obviously have a certain amount of flexibility in deciding how much private sector involvement will go into any individual production deal. It must have that sort of flexibility. That is the nature of the film industry. If Senator Puplick is not prepared to acknowledge that that is the nature of the film industry I do not think he knows very much about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the overall allocation of its funding the AFFC must be allowed a certain amount of discretion in deciding the allocation of its funds and the proportion of its funds. Certainly a proportion will go to feature film production, which in recent years has not been as successful as we might have hoped under the tax incentive scheme. It is also very clear that a certain amount will go to television and to children's productions on television, which have been extremely successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also referred to a film that may or may not be funded by the new Australian Film Finance Corporation. It is a film called Till the End of the World and it is going to be made by Wim Wenders, who is an internationally renowned film maker. Senator Puplick on the one hand commends Wim Wenders for his reputation and on the other hand suggests that the Film Corporation is worthy of criticism for investing money in a film to be made by an internationally renowned film maker. I do not understand the reasoning behind this. In any case, the Film Corporation has not yet made any decision on this project, so it seems to me quite early to make any kind of pronouncement on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also complained about the cost of the new Australian Film Finance Corporation office. As I pointed out earlier, he forgot to mention the cost to the taxpayer of the tax concession scheme over the years. By comparison with that, the cost of the office, which would have to fund quite a large staff, pales. He said that the board of the new Australian Film Finance Corporation is `overloaded with people whose responsibilities are considerable and whose qualifications appear to be just as much directed towards their active support, membership or participation in the activities of the Australian Labor Party as those of the film industry'. I believe that is incorrect, and I will give honourable senators some of the details of the board members. </PARA>
<PARA> William Gurry is a barrister and solicitor and is Managing Director of the National Mutual Royal Bank Ltd. He has been a director of the merchant bank Hill Samuel Australia and Executive Director of the Australian Bank Ltd. Anthony Hartnell is a corporate lawyer and a member of the legal committee of the Business Council of Australia, a director of various companies and a member of the Commercial Law Association of Australia Ltd. There is also Dr Patricia Edgar, who has proven herself to be a most professional and competent director of the Australian Children's Television Foundation. She has a position on the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission and was visiting professor at the Department of Communications at the University of Iowa in the United States of America. Patricia Edgar is very well known for the work she has done for children's television in this country, including the degree to which she has actually made it a commercial proposition. I defy Senator Puplick to talk about the Labor Party's connections of these people. He certainly has not proved it in what he said yesterday. In any case, these people all have distinguished records in their own careers. I think their careers speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also says that the board `is singularly defective in terms of people who actually produce and make films', and `there are no producers of films on the board'. He is quite incorrect about that. One of the board members is Gabrielle Kelly, who is a documentary maker. Dr Patricia Edgar is an executive producer in the Australian Children's Television Foundation, and of course Jack Thompson, who is also a board member, has been involved in films for many years now as an actor and soon to be a producer. I doubt very much that these people on the board will actually be deciding which projects are to be funded by the new Film Corporation. I am sure that, like most board members, they are there to decide on policy and on the overall direction of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The best that Senator Puplick could say was that he believes the Film Finance Corporation model will fail and that it will be a betrayal of the Australian film industry. But he put nothing in his remarks to support his claim. It is therefore not surprising that Senator Puplick should mourn the passing of the tax incentives for the film industry and their replacement, in effect, by what is a government organisation which is able to control how many and what sorts of films and major television projects are to be made in Australia. It is not surprising because the major grouping of individuals who benefited more than any other from the tax incentives, known as division 10BA, were Senator Puplick's friends, among the sharp lawyers and money men around town. It was these people who gradually destroyed the integrity of what had been a very worthwhile and largely bipartisan government endeavour to assist film production in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator would just be quiet he might learn something. The lawyers, the accountants, and the stockbrokers who participated in the film industry by recommending film investment to their clients, charging brokerage of up to 10 per cent and inflating the budgets of the films in question by up to 200 per cent in some cases, are the people who will suffer because of the establishment of the new Australian Film Finance Corporation. Under the tax incentives that Senator Puplick seems so fond of, the actual owners of the films which were made-the investors-did not care what sort of film was being made. Most of the time, they did not even know. The rorts which were going on under these incentives were well known to most of the professionals working in the film industry, and it was those professionals who wanted to call a stop to it. It was Prime Minister Fraser, I believe, who established the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this new scheme of assistance, the Government now has a far greater say in the type of films which may be made, the costs associated with those films and whether the people who make them have the right track record. In other words, the Government is able to control much more closely an industry which has cost the Australian taxpayers several hundred million dollars since 1980. Is it wrong to want to have a greater say in the expenditure of such large amounts of money, or should we leave it up to Senator Puplick's friends in North Shore legal practices and Bond Street broking houses?</PARA>
<PARA> The AFFC Board has just announced the granting of assistance to its first project. It is a television series which is a sequel to the very successful mini-series All The Rivers Run to be produced by Crawfords in Australia. Other projects are soon to be announced. </PARA>
<PARA> The AFFC Board consists of a blend of people from the film industry, from the law and from banking. Its Chairman, Kim Williams, who may or may not be a follower of the Australian Labor Party, happens to have led the Australian Film Commission (AFC), as its Chief Executive for four years, through the period of greatest change and productivity that the Australian film industry has ever seen. I remind honourable senators that in 1984 he was appointed by a Board which consisted largely of appointees of the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Williams also happens to be one of the most highly regarded individuals in the film industry. In a sense, he was born into it. His father, Mr David Williams, was Managing Director of the Greater Union organisation until a few years ago. Mr Williams had already established his own credentials in the arts industry before he came to the Film Commission. He was previously the Managing Director of Musica Viva, which is the largest chamber music organisation in the world. He also showed his analytical skills through a report he wrote for the Government on the Australian Opera. However, Senator Puplick continues to use this chamber to carry out what can only be perceived as a personal vendetta against Mr Williams. The only reason for his consistent attacks that I can think of is that Mr Williams does not have as many close personal friends who are lawyers, accountants and stockbrokers as Senator Puplick has. If he does, he does not let that get in the way of his better judgment for the future of the film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I commend the AFC which this year established Film Australia, its production arm, as a wholly-owned government film making body. Under the highly competent and professional leadership of Robin Hughes, it is also working to develop a more commercial basis for its operations. The AFC, in a spirit of fostering international cooperation in film making, has also established a number of international film; making treaties with other countries. One of its co-productions with New Zealand, The Navigator, took out the best feature award at this year's Australian Film Institute festival. The AFC will continue to support low budget and experimental film making with its special production fund which assures the future of the industry by fostering the work of young talent. </PARA>
<PARA> The AFC and Kim Williams are to be commended not only for the leading role they have played in the establishment of the AFFC, but also generally for their invaluable work in fostering film culture in Australia. There have been few Australian films made in the last few years in which the AFC has not played a leading role. Many of those films have been acclaimed internationally. </PARA>

<PARA> A former distinguished Liberal member of parliament, the Hon. Bill Wentworth, now aged 81, continues to have an active interest in matters economic. Bill Wentworth got his initial training through the Treasury in New South Wales in the 1930s. As honourable senators will recall, he was a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs; and he has taken a keen interest in questions of the current account deficit, on which he has written extensively. I am impressed by one of the papers he has written recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wentworth argues that the trends of the first two months of this year, which he was able to observe when he wrote the paper, are ominous in relation to what is likely to happen to the current account deficit. He then analyses the elements that go into making up this figure; namely, the goods and services element and the property and income and miscellaneous elements of the current account deficit. He draws attention to several trends which are developing and which affect each of these figures. He doubts that we have any chance of achieving the benchmark of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of a $7.4 billion current account deficit. He doubts also that we can achieve the Treasury officials' estimate which appeared in the Budget Papers of $9,500m for the current account deficit. He advises to watch the figures coming in over succeeding months. I have to say to the Senate that the figures have come in and would tend to confirm the points made by Mr Wentworth. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the brief 2 1/2 page document that he has written. </PARA>

<PARA> THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT-UP OR DOWN?</PARA>

<PARA> The Government's whole financial strategy is based on the premise that its policies are bringing Australia's Deficit on Current Account under control. If the trend of that Deficit should be upward, not downward, then its policies will have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The results for the first two months of this financial year carry ominous overtones. In July and August 1988 the Deficit has been nearly $3,000 million, as against only about $2,100 million for the same two months of 1987. Too much weight, of course, should not be placed on the result for so short a period, but there are basic reasons which suggest that it represents a real trend. </PARA>

<PARA> The grant reduction in the 1987-88 Goods and Services deficit, as compared with the previous year, was due entirely to changes in overseas prices. For that period as a whole our export prices rose by about 8 per cent, while our import prices scarcely rose at all, so our ``terms of trade'' substantially improved. With 1987-88 Exports at $40544 million and Imports at $40410 million, it is evident that, without those overseas price changes, the total 1987-88 Current Account result would have been about even with 1985-86 peak, and somewhat worse than the result for 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> Can we expect a similar improvement in our terms of trade for 1988-89 as compared with 1987-88? Nobody should be too dogmatic about future world prices (our agricultural exports have already received an unpredicted bonus from Northern Hemisphere droughts) but the consensus of economic opinion is that, on the whole, our 1988-89 terms of trade will be a little worse than for last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The real volume of exports can be expected to rise next year, but not by much more than the 42.5 per cent which the ABS reports for last year. Meanwhile, the real volume of imports continues to surge upwards. The ABS reports an increase of 9 per cent for last year, and this year's increase will be fueled by the Government policy of tariff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> On the services side, receipts from tourism will increase (the travel credit last year was $2959 million, an increase of $741 million over the previous year) but as against this the travel debit for Australians overseas at $3572 million increased last year by $366 million, so that the net improvement was only $275 million. The net improvement for 1988-89 is not likely to be very much different. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject therefore to uncertainties about the future course of world prices, there is reason to expect that the downward trend in the ``Goods and Services'' deficit, which has been running for the last two years, will be replaced by an upward trend, starting this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The deficit for ``Property Income etc.'' has been going up over the last four years by about $1,000 million per year, and this is likely to continue. The main engine driving it upwards is the income earned by the net annual foreign investment which is needed to finance the annual Current Account shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem, therefore, that the bad figures for this July and August should not be lightly brushed aside. It is all too likely that they represent a real trend. With both the ``Goods and Services'' deficit rising and the ``Property Income etc'' deficit doing the same, the trend for the Current Account Deficit seems set to be upward also. The implications of this for the Government's financial policies are all too clear. </PARA>
<PARA> In his Budget Speech on 23 August, Mr Keating correctly described the balance of payments deficit as ``Australia's number one economic problem.'' If this strategy has failed to deal with it, then his strategy has failed overall. </PARA>
<PARA> It is somewhat ironic that while Mr Keating, over in Berlin was telling US and West Germany how they should reform their economies on the Australian pattern, he seems oblivious of what is happening here at home. Perhaps someone will remind him of the well-worn phrase about notes and beams. </PARA>
<PARA> And what about this year's Current Account Deficit. How will it measure up to the Treasurer's benchmark of $7,400 million, set in his own Budget Speech? There he forecast that ``This year our balance of payments deficit will be halved from its peak of just on three years ago.'' (The 1985-86 peak was, in fact, $14,807 million). </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that, in the Treasury papers attached to the Budget, the estimated deficit was set at $9,500 million, but the Treasurer himself adopted the lesser figure quite unequivocally. So far no explanation of the discrepancy has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> It is somewhat curious that so little attention has so far been paid to this crucial discrepancy of $2,100 million between the Treasurer's figures and those of his Department. At the last election, when there was a discrepancy of a quarter of this size in the Opposition's Budget Estimates, Mr Keating himself was quite scathing. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is more important that even the Treasury officials' estimate of $9500 million for the Current Account Deficit now seems to have been far too low. The absolute proof of this will have to wait the monthly figures as they come in, but the probability is already more than sufficient to occasion proper concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Analyses have been conducted over recent years at government and industry level and by international agencies to review aspects of Australian and New Zealand assistance to the dairy industry. Major changes have been made recently to policies affecting assistance levels for dairying in each country and some of these policies continue to affect assistance levels.</PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian perspective, key concerns in the recent negotiations on dairy matters in the Review of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement centred on the monopoly export and pricing powers of the New Zealand Dairy Board and the implications for unrestricted access by New Zealand to the Australian market from 1 July 1990 when the current Memorandum of Understanding on Dairy Products between the Australian and New Zealand dairy industries ceases.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background the Government has negotiated arrangements, which are of treaty status, to apply to trans-Tasman trade in dairy products from 1 July 1990 to ensure that trade is fair as well as free. The agreed arrangements are consistent with the principles and objectives of ANZCERTA and include understandings contained in an exchange of letters between the Australian and New Zealand Governments which guarantee fair trading tactics.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) The $350,000 contribution of 2 September 1988 was an initial response for-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Emergency medical and relief supplies disbursed through the Australian High Commission in Dhaka and local non-government organisations (NGOs); and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) urgent survey work on damage to roads and bridges to be carried out by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC).</PARA>
<PARA> On 9 September, a further $1 million was approved for emergency food aid in the form of 5000 tonnes of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA> On 13 September, $20,000 was provided towards the promotion costs for an appeal by the International Disaster Emergencies Committee (IDEC) for their Bangladesh Flood Appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> On 20 September the Government provided $115,000 for the charter of an aircraft to fly urgently needed food, medicines and water purifying tablets provided by several Australian NGOs.</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 November the government announced the following package of assistance</PARA>

<PARA> a commitment to provide $22 million in developmental food aid to Bangladesh over the next two years to better enable the Government of Bangladesh to plan its development activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) and (c) The 1988 floods displaced and affected an estimated 45 million people, 40 per cent of the population of 110 million. The official death toll as a direct result of the floods is 1644. More than 735 deaths were caused subsequently by diarrhoeal disease. The indirect death toll is likely to have been much higher.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The full extent of damage to roads and bridges will be known when the SMEC and Asian Development Bank (ADB) teams complete their reports, but it is expected to be very extensive. The preliminary estimate of damage to roads, bridges and railroads is US$246 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The impact of the floods on the Bangladesh economy is obviously devastating and a joint government of Bangladesh/UN assessment team has just completed its report. Fifteen per cent of the food crop has been lost, an estimated 2.5 million tonnes. The extent of damage to other crops is similarly grave. The UN held a special meeting in mid-November which provided a detailed analysis of damage, along with rehabilitation needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Draft EIS is planned for release in April 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Jervis Bay marine ecological studies are planned to be completed by 30 November 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The draft EIS will be released well before the completion of the marine studies. The marine studies will address the overall need for ongoing management of the Jervis Bay marine environment having regard to the Navy's current, and continuing, activities there. Should a decision be made to go ahead with development of an Armament Depot or Fleet Base at Jervis Bay, then this data will also provide a basis for the development of appropriate environmental management plans.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that the two known periods of intensive scallop fishing form a cycle of the scallop population.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Any Naval relocation to Jervis Bay will not occur prior to the development of a management plan based substantially on the marine studies presently being conducted. If the 7 to 9 year cycle exists, as suggested in the previous question, then it should occur during the currency of the planned marine ecology studies.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The marine studies conducted over 3 years will provide highly credible research information that will address the principal components of the ecosystems and their cycles. Cycles which occur within the study period will be observed, the most significant being the yearly cycle. In the longer term, planned monitoring programmes should provide further knowledge of systems which have longer cycles. The duration and extent of the studies go further than any normally undertaken in association with development proposals.</PARA>

<PARA> Can the Minister provide further details to that provided in his reply to my Question on Notice No. 417 of 2 June 1988, about the recall action which may be instituted in case contamination is found in a consignment of cheese, in particular: (a) to what extent is such recall enforceable; and (b) if not fully enforceable, how effective is it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The recall action which is instituted in any case where contamination is found in a consignment of imported cheese is administered by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs of the Attorney-General's Department in cooperation with the state/territory health departments. Such recall action is effected on a voluntary basis by distributors of goods which are considered to pose a risk to public health. However, the Trade Practices Act empowers the Minister for Consumer Affairs to effect a mandatory recall of such product if voluntary action is not satisfactory. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service considers that such action is effective provided that recall is initiated expeditiously. To supplement these formal recall procedures, additional measures involving advising importers to withhold distribution of product as soon as generic tests show the likelihood of failure, have been implemented. Importers have responded well to this voluntary scheme of product control. Additionally, the Service has the authority under the Quarantine Act to apply mandatory controls and recall product into quarantine bond should co-operation not be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Only two positive confirmed detections of Listeria monocytogenes, both from the Category 1 group of cheeses, i.e. cheeses with a previous history of failure in Australia or overseas, have been made since the routine import monitoring regimen for cheese was finalised in January 1988. No recall was necessary to prevent the distribution of these products as they were being held in quarantine bond pending clearance by testing. All affected product was destroyed under quarantine supervision. Additionally there were three false positives reported and in all these cases the importers involved were advised and voluntarily withheld their product from distribution until confirmatory testing indicated freedom from Listeria monocytogenes.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Treasurer, or the Treasurer, aware that some employers, at the suggestion of the Australian Taxation Office, are already requesting employees to furnish tax file numbers in anticipation of the extended use of the tax file numbering system after November?

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office is not suggesting to employers that they seek the tax file numbers of their employees. Such action by employers would be clearly inappropriate prior to the commencement date for the new tax file number arrangements as they apply to employees. That date is to be set by proclamation and a public announcement will be made at the relevant time.
