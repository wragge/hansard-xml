<PARA> That the Senate extends a warm welcome to Australia and to the Senate to His Excellency Dr Francesco Cossiga, President of the Italian Republic, and expresses the hope that his visit will be an enjoyable and fruitful one and will confirm the cordial relations between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's links with Italy may be traced back a century or more to the period before the unification of Italy. Perhaps not many Australians know this but it is a fact that there was an Italian, one Raffaelo Carboni, at the Eureka Stockade. Perhaps the words `avanti popolo' which later became famous in Italy were first heard at the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat. Italian participation in Australia's migration programs in the 1950s and subsequently is a foundation on which the present much broader links have been built and which ensures the significant personal awareness of each country in the other. Over 300,000 of today's Australians were born in Italy and another half a million or so are of Italian extraction. These Australians have made an enormous contribution to Australia's economic prosperity and to the enrichment of our cultural life. They are highly valued and respected members of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We thank President Cossiga for his visit during our bicentennial year. Italy has played a very prominent part in those celebrations. Many senators have probably visited the Italian pavilion at World Expo 1988 in Brisbane. Bologna hosted a very interesting and well attended conference on Australia earlier this year and there was an Australian pavilion at the Venice Biennale in June. In May this permanent Parliament House was officially opened. The architect is an Italian and so is some of the marble and craftsmanship. The Italian Navy participated in the recent naval review in Sydney Harbour. The artistic highlight of Italy's contribution to our Bicentennial is Italy on Stage, a magnificent festival with 500 artists presenting music, theatre and ballet around Australia, some of which will be performed in the presence of His Excellency President Cossiga. Our business ties with Italy are significant and I think they will become even more so. Many of our larger construction firms were established by Italian migrants. Australia and Italy are substantial trading partners. Our total trade in 1987 was over $A2 billion. I believe that we can do even better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, Mr President, I had lunch with the Foreign Minister of Italy, Mr Andreotti. He told me that the Italian Parliament is about to consider a change to its standing orders which would require open voting instead of the present system which provides for a secret vote in parliament. I suspect that some members of the Opposition in this Parliament sometimes wish that we practised the Italian system. But on this occasion, in moving that the Senate welcome you, President Cossiga, and your party, I am certain that all honourable senators will be enthusiastic in publicly recording their support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to support the motion on behalf of the Opposition. We join in welcoming you, Dr Cossiga, to Australia and express the hope that your visit will be enjoyable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Your Excellency, you are visiting a country to which Italians have made a great contribution. As you probably know, Italians first migrated to Australia in numbers around the 1860s. They went into different areas-mostly the harsher areas. They worked in mines. They were engaged in timber felling, cutting sugar, clearing land and the like. They worked in these areas mainly until World War II. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has said, after World War II the Italian migrants who were here and those who came to this country moved into the professions, businesses and primary industries where they farmed wheat and wool, grew beef and sugar cane and engaged in dairying. All of those industries benefited from their endeavours. As I have said, mining certainly progressed because of the amount of work that they did. Eventually, Italians got into the building industry and highway and bridge construction. They also entered the fashion industry. Carla Zampatti, probably the most well-known fashion name in Australia, is from northern Italy. Italians have also entered the retail and hospitality trades. Many members of this chamber certainly make good use of the hospitality provided by Italian restaurants. Australians have gained many skills that have been brought to this country by Italians. </PARA>
<PARA> My family originated from the province of Sondrio in north Italy. I can speak with first-hand knowledge of the opportunity that Australia has provided. It is one thing for migrants to come to this country but it is another thing for the host country to provide opportunities. I feel that my family and many others are living proof of what can be achieved in Australia as a result of the opportunities which Australia provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Older Italians worked hard and deprived themselves of a lot of things so that their children could have what they did not have. One of those was education. As you probably know, Mr President, education was not for everyone in Italy in the early 1920s. Because of the instability of some governments of the time, Italians went all over the world-not only to Australia but also to America, Canada, South Africa and the like-looking for opportunities. As I said, they got those opportunities in Australia. As a result, younger Italians have been able to go into the professions. They have certainly achieved good results there. </PARA>
<PARA> Italian names appear among university professors, in the professions of medicine, law, dental science, politics and, probably the most important of all, engineering. We have Italian judges and Italian mayors. In fact, Mayor Cattalini, the mayor of Fremantle, the city which hosted the America's Cup, was my guest here last night. I understand that there are now nine Italian members of parliament around Australia. I believe that the President of the Legislative Council of Victoria is an Italian. I also believe that Victoria has an Italian judge. Incidentally, Mr President, you will be happy to know that the first Italian born member of the House of Representatives, Mr Sciacca, was elected to that House last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In sport also Italian names have come to the fore-famous names such as Barrassi, Silvagni, Pianto, Marchesi, people in Victoria who have made Australian Rules famous. My family name has not done too badly in South Australia, and certainly in Western Australia there are a lot of Italian names in sport. Also, there is an Italian who, if he has not yet made test cricket, is about to do so; that is, young Mike Valetta in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In total, Italian migrants have achieved a great deal for Australian society: not only have they contributed to our economy and culture but they have also contributed to Australian family life. Italian family life is certainly respected in Australia. Speaking as an Australian now, Mr President, I can assure you that many Australian families envy the Italian type of family life. Italians have proved that they are the types of migrants that can fully integrate into Australian society, as they have integrated into societies in all parts of the world. On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome the opportunity to take into Australia many more migrants in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I wish you very well for the rest of your trip in Australia. I hope it will be most enjoyable, and I certainly look forward to my next visit to your country. That is something I do as often as I can and will do again as soon as I can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me particular pleasure today to join in welcoming Dr Cossiga to Australia and to the Senate chamber. Much has been said already about the contribution made by Italy and Italians to Australia. This was said at lunch; it was said a few moments ago by Senators Button and Panizza. And those contributions, of course, have included the cultural and economic contribution made by Italian migrants as well, of course, as the more recent very generous contribution made by the Italian people and Government to Australia's bicentennial celebrations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said a moment ago, it gives me particular pleasure to speak here today, because only a matter of some two or three weeks ago, as a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European Parliament, I had the privilege of actually meeting Dr Cossiga in his own country and indeed in his own office. It is quite a different experience to meet the President of the Republic of Italy in the sorts of circumstances in which one does over there, surrounded by the ancient and unique beauty of the Italian culture in its own setting. Dr Cossiga was particularly generous in allowing the delegation access to some of the several hundred rooms of the palace in which he has his office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hear, hear!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am joined in that expression of thanks by one of my colleagues on the delegation, Senator Michael Baume. In fact, I do not think it is going too far to say that we almost overdosed on cathedrals, ceilings, marble and artistry as we moved around Italy, and the President's palace is a classic example of everything that is beautiful and needs to be preserved in Italy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President also gave us a tremendous amount of his time and discussed a wide range of topics with the members of the delegation, and we could not help being struck by the impressive knowledge that the President had and by the views that he was able to pass on to us. The President's background, as I dare say many honourable senators know, is in constitutional law, and his detailed knowledge of the Australian and Canadian constitutions was immediately apparent. Indeed, it was a quite striking contrast to the appalling lack of knowledge of the Australian Constitution that I think many Australians have. We were somewhat awed by his erudition in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also able to be part of some discussions with the President and his colleagues about the difficulties of constitutional reform, apt in the wake of our own referendum proposals here. The Senate might be interested to know that while we were there the Italian Senate was debating a number of constitutional changes including an end to the secret ballot provisions that operate in the Italian Parliament. Some changes were being suggested with regard to impeachments of Ministers-Ministers who have been charged with some sort of criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA> What was also important to Australia-and I think to the President and other members of Parliament that we spoke to while we were there-was the problems affecting Europe and Australia as 1992 approaches. We benefited considerably from the President's own comments with regard to the coming harmonisation in Europe. I think Senator Baume will acknowledge that we shared his cynicism with regard to possible economic benefits since, as he pointed out, he has not run into an economist yet who has been able to explain clearly what the benefits, ramifications and outcomes are likely to be in 1992. Certainly, Australia needs to look to expand such areas as joint ventures based in Italy and other European countries as well as joint ventures based in Australia if we want to hedge our bets in that area. Along with my Australian Democrat colleagues I welcome the President of the Republic of Italy and hope that he derives as much pleasure and benefit from his visit to Australia as we did on the parliamentary delegation to his country. </PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility.</PARA>

I ask: What is the Government's current position on taxes and wages? Is it a tax cut and a wage increase, as promised by the Prime Minister?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is playing with words and, indeed, with the truth to say that Senator Walsh threatened anything. Let me say that, of course, it has been said since the time of the Budget that the Government would be approaching the wages issue in the early part of 1989 on the basis of a tax-wage trade-off. At the time of the Budget it was said that the size of the tax cut would depend, amongst other things, on the movement in wages that took place following the national wage case of this year and prior to March 1989. The question of a balance between tax cuts and wage rises is something that must be determined, having regard to a number of matters which are likely to take place before that issue is negotiated. It is a matter of taking those factors into account and arriving at an appropriate balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has said on at least one occasion that the most desirable thing would be for the tax cuts to be of sufficient amounts to negate the necessity for a wage rise, in the light of the Government's statement that it will preserve the level of real wages throughout next year. But again that is a matter which remains to be seen, and it is a matter of judgment at the time as to what will be the appropriate course. The Government will advise when it has reached a conclusion about that matter next year.</PARA>

<PARA>For simplicity, I will assume an `average earner' to be a person with a taxable income of $24,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Such a person presently pays $5,601 tax. A tax cut of $56 a week would reduce that liability by $2,912 or 52 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Does he agree with Senator Walsh's statement that an average worker would need a reduction in his or her tax liability of 52 per cent to make up for the imposts of the Hawke Government imposed between March 1983 and 1 July 1989?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understood the burden of Senator Walsh's comments on the $56 reduction in tax, it was to illustrate the utter innumeracy of the Opposition and its incapacity, as always, to make any sensible calculations that will lead to a sensible economic result. That is what Senator Walsh was concerned to do. I do not believe this is a supplementary question at all, Mr President, because in Senator Lewis's first question he asked whether I agreed with the threat made by Senator Walsh. The only threat in Senator Walsh's comments, as quoted by Senator Lewis, was aimed at the credibility of the Opposition, but that is not much of a threat. The credibility of the Opposition in terms of numeracy is rock-bottom, and there was no threat in what Senator Walsh said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Finance a question about the average living standards in the Australian community. The Minister has stated that real household disposable income per capita increased by 4.4 per cent between 1982-83 and 1987-88. I was concerned to hear a subsequent claim that that was largely due to a rise in capital-sourced income received by the very wealthy in the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple answer is that the claim is not true, but I will not just leave that hanging in the air-I will produce the evidence. I have seen Mr Peacock's press release and he clearly has difficulties with the concept of an average. The figure for average weekly earnings which he likes to use is an average of the wages and salaries of all adult full time wage and salary earners. That means that it includes the salary of the Federal President of the Liberal Party, for example, as well as the wages of less well paid Australian workers. The average that Mr Peacock likes to use appears to be an average of adult male full time wage and salary earners, which therefore obviously ignores the one million self-employed, the 1 1/2 million retired people, be they social security recipients or not, and the fact that almost three million women are in the paid work force. Surely the average living standard of the Australian community is what applies to all Australians and not just to a subsection of them. But I have asked my Department to check on Mr Peacock's claim. I will quote Mr Peacock:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the increases in Senator Walsh's aggregate measure of real per capita household disposal income have been largely due to a rise in capital sourced incomes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>When I asked members of my Department to analyse and check this claim, they informed me that if real household disposable income per capita were recomputed with income received by households from interest, dividends and rents excluded, the increase over the period-I repeat `the increase'-from 1982-83 to 1987-88 was 4 per cent as against 4.4 per cent if they were not excluded.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Messner thinks that that is great news. Before he becomes too enthusiastic about it, let me tell him that when the figures are adjusted to exclude capital sourced incomes, although the growth figure between 1982-83 to 1987-88 goes down to 4 per cent real increase, the fall in real per capita disposable incomes in 1982-83-and who was in charge of the economy then, Senator Messner?-previously recorded at 1.8 per cent, declines to 2.5 per cent. So in the last year that the discredited former Treasurer had the principal responsibility for the management of the Australian economy, real per capita disposable incomes, with the rent, interest and dividends taken out of them, fell by 2 1/2 per cent in one year. In the last year that Mr Howard was in charge of this economy the incomes of ordinary Australians, with capital sourced income excluded, fell by 2 1/2 per cent; and on that basis they have increased by a net 4 per cent since.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be tempted to do so, Senator Aulich. There are two series of complaints about Mr Freezer, one related to a period in about February this year when complaints were made to both the South Australian Legal Services Commission and the South Australian Department of Consumer Affairs. Those complaints ranged on four specific levels: first, as to the cost of the services provided; secondly, the quality; thirdly, the approach and the manner of the salespersons involved operating for Mr Freezer, which from time to time were seen to be assertive, aggressive, tough, evasive and so on; and fourthly, misrepresentations on behalf of the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of those complaints were brought together by the South Australian Department of Community Welfare and, together with the then Consumer Affairs Department's involvement and the Legal Services Commission, the matters were, I think, rectified in that all complaints, particularly all of those by pensioners, and disputes about the organisation were settled quite amicably. Because those complaints were settled the Federal Government, through the Trade Practices Commission, took a holding interest in the operation of the organisation. Commitments were made by Mr Freezer that the marketing strategy of that organisation would be changed and in fact that the practices that had been complained of would not be proceeded with. As a consequence, as from the middle of June this year, the Trade Practices Commission, as I said, conducted a holding operation of the Mr Freezer organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, since that date, particularly on 13 August, the Commission received a further complaint as well as three other complaints, totalling four, about the operation of the organisation. The complaints are very similar to the ones that were raised beforehand and are identical to those in the Investigators program. As a consequence of those complaints the Commission is waiting to take action. However, we are talking, firstly, through both State and Federal government agencies, to the Mr Freezer organisation to see whether we can, through the established processes, once again settle the problems involved. If that is not done, there is provision under the Trade Practices Act, particularly section 52a, to prosecute, amongst other things--</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that Dr John Colquhoun, the former Chairman of the Fluoridation Promotion Committee of New Zealand, has recently shown that there is equal or less tooth decay in unfluoridated Christchurch than in the other major cities of New Zealand, which are all fluoridated? He has also shown that the decline in tooth decay in New Zealand children commenced before the fluoridation of water supplies or the use of fluorides in any form. Is the Minister also aware that Dr Alan S. Gray, former Chief Dental Officer of British Columbia, Canada, has revealed that there is less tooth decay in the unfluoridated parts of his province than in the fluoridated parts? Is he aware that the incidence of tooth decay is the same in unfluoridated Brisbane as in fluoridated Adelaide and Perth? In short, is the Minister aware that there is growing scientific evidence that fluoridation of water supplies may be less effective than its proponents have claimed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Dr John Colquhoun has been making claims concerning fluoridation in New Zealand and parts of Australia and that he is campaigning against fluoridation as a means of preventing dental decay. I am advised that data presented by Dr Colquhoun in Community Health Studies Volume II, pages 85 to 90, 1977, which purport to show that children in unfluoridated Christchurch, New Zealand, have less tooth decay than in fluoridated New Zealand cities, have a major discrepancy in that they fail to take into account the fluoride history of the children. The children in Christchurch would comprise a mixture of lifelong residents and newer arrivals. Similarly, the children in fluoridated cities would comprise lifelong residents and newer arrivals. The only valid way of comparing the effects of fluoridation on dental caries is to compare lifelong residents of a fluoridated community in the same geographic region. Dr Colquhoun has not done this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The claim that dental decay declined before the introduction of fluoridation applies only to New Zealand five-year-olds. Extensive data is available for two older age groups, namely, eight- to nine-year-olds and 12- to 13-year-olds. This data shows that there was no decline in dental caries before the introduction of water fluoridation. I am advised that no data has appeared in the referred scientific literature from Dr A. S. Gray relating to dental decay in children in British Columbia, Canada, which takes into account a fluoride history of the subjects.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to caries rates in Australian school children, the question apparently referred to data collected by school dental services of each State and processed by the Department of Community Services and Health. Such data cannot be used to draw inferences about the effectiveness of water fluoridation. It does not take into account such important factors as, first, the fluoride history of the subject; secondly, regional difference in dental caries; thirdly, the size and severity of caries lesions; and, fourthly, the number of primary teeth previously extracted because of dental caries.</PARA>
<PARA> The fluoridation of water supplies has been the subject of numerous inquiries in the past. There is no recent data which negates the support of the National Health and Medical Research Council for fluoridation of water supplies. A very comprehensive collection of reports and statements from all over the world entitled Fluoridation of Water was published in 1985 by the Department of Community Services and Health. The Department's view is that the evidence in support of continual fluoridation is overwhelming. I table for the interest of the honourable senator the document Fluoridation of Water-a collection of reports and statements from the Department of Community Services and Health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that, on 5 October, a clear majority-about 55 per cent-of Chileans rejected the prospect of a further eight years of rule by General Pinochet. The Australian Government welcomes the result of the plebiscite as a victory for democracy and the people of Chile. The 1980 Constitution provides that Chile will now proceed to open presidential and congressional elections late in 1989, with General Pinochet continuing as caretaker President until March 1990. There have been calls, mainly from some sections of the Opposition both in Chile and outside, for the election process to be accelerated. I am told that General Pinochet has reaffirmed his intention to adhere to the constitutional arrangements entered into in 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government believes that the timing of open elections is a matter for the Chileans themselves to decide but, having regard to the history which I have just outlined, we would be hopeful that they would be as soon as possible within that framework. The Government also hopes that in the sensitive period ahead all sides will recognise the need for open and constructive dialogue in an atmosphere free of violence and rancour. We are aware of reports of violence arising from post-plebiscite demonstrations. It is vital that the liberalisation of public freedoms and political debate which preceded the plebiscite should be allowed to continue.

As the Minister clearly recognises the importance of the service allowance as compensation, as there is serious disaffection within the Services caused by the lack of equity in the service allowance, and in the light of the serious wastage of trained personnel from the Services, I ask the Minister: Why has the Government not recommended that a meaningful service allowance be extended to all ranks of the Australian Defence Force?</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, I do not know whether the Law Council per se was involved in this or whether it made public statements at the time of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but among the most shameful episodes, if not the most shameful, in the history of the Australian legal profession was the collaborative endeavours of tax evaders and prominent lawyers in that late 1970s-early 1980s period to pick the pockets of honest Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government's steel plan ends on 31 December 1988. It is quite unlikely that any major investment would be made before then. The question about whether it fits in with the plan will not be relevant. Whether it is desirable in terms of the Australian economy is a matter in respect of which one would want further information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the press statement. The underlying facts behind my statement are these: in March 1983 the average total earnings of adult full time wage and salary earners was $344 per week-I will leave off the odd cents-on which the tax payable was nearly $77. In June 1988 the average total earnings, again for full time wage and salary earners, was $495 per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Assuming a 5.5 per cent wage growth by June of next year, that figure will become $523 per week, on which the tax payable will be $132. Again, I leave off the odd cents. However, by deducting the weekly tax of March 1983 from the weekly tax of June 1983-of course, these are in nominal dollars-the precise difference is $55.567, which of course rounds up to $56 a week. Perhaps Mr Peacock did not arrive at his $56 a week in that way. If he did not, I invite him to explain in which way he did arrive at it.</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever peculiar methodology Mr Peacock may have used-if, indeed, he used any methodology at all-it is a very peculiar view of `making up for the absence of tax scale indexation'. What Mr Peacock clearly fails to understand, regardless of what pseudo or voodoo methodology he may have used, is that if nominal income doubles over a period, and the nominal amount of tax remains the same, the average tax rate will halve, and the real level of tax revenue will be halved with it. Of course, Mr Peacock is the man who, a couple of months ago, told us he was not going to bring an accountant's view to these matters-an intention which, if I may say so, becomes more apparent every time he opens his mouth.

<PARA> In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, the Shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, was pleased to suggest personal tax cuts-around $56 a week for average earners . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If Mr Peacock has never advocated that, he should have corrected the Financial Review at the time. While he is about it, he might also care to correct one of the other less distinguished members of the Opposition front bench who, in a letter published in the Western Farmer on 22 September, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian families need tax relief now. A tax cut of $56 per week is necessary just to put the household income back to 1983 pre-Keating levels.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the latter assertion in that quotation is false. Mr Blunt is clearly advocating a tax cut of $56 a week, as I understand it, for average earners and presumably proportional reductions in taxation for people with incomes above and below average earnings. As I pointed out a couple of weeks ago, and repeated last week-although Senator Lewis chose not to quote that part of my speech today-the cost to revenue would be $23.5 billion. So we have two $20 billion men floating around as the leading economic spokesmen for the Opposition, advocating the irresponsible fiscal policy that the Opposition advocated about 15 months ago.

I will cite one particular example which I find particularly difficult to deal with: the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, which itself is required to be audited by the Auditor-General, has a number of joint venture arrangements with the private sector. The condition of at least one of these joint venture arrangements was that the auditor chosen for the joint venture had to be mutually agreed between the two shareholders, which clearly gave the private sector shareholder the right to veto the appointment of the Auditor-General as the auditor if the private sector shareholder chose to do so. In fact, that is exactly what happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can see no easy resolution to that problem, Senator Watson. As far as I am concerned, and I have been involved in this exercise for nearly four years, the bottom line of accountability to the Parliament is the return on the assets which are invested in public enterprises; that is, if the value of the assets is showing a proper return, after adjustment in some cases for acknowledged obligations to provide certain services which are by themselves uneconomic, that is the measure of control and the measure of accountability. But, of course, all business enterprises, be they in the public sector or the private sector, have to be accountable in the sense that their accounts must be presented accurately to their shareholders and to the public in general and they must not be involved in dishonest practices.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Article 11 of the World Health Organisation code, which is the one that Senator Giles refers to, does ask member governments to take action to give effect to the principles and aims of the code. The Australian Government has taken this to mean that the most appropriate action by way of implementation is not to legislate but to embark upon a number of alternative measures. At this stage I think only six countries in the world have, in fact, adopted the World Health Organisation code by way of legislation. Australia has decided, as have most other countries, to take the alternative course of action and has preferred to give effect to voluntary adoption of the principles of the code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The code has been adopted by six countries, as I mentioned. Those six countries are the ones in which infant mortality is at the highest rates. As I said, our preferred approach has been to take the alternative and to promote voluntary adoption of the code. In doing so, we have taken three substantive measures. Firstly, we have negotiated with industry the adoption of the principles by way of an industry code of practice. This has been signed by manufacturers of infant formula. Secondly, and with reference to Article 9 of the WHO code, this aspect, which deals with product labelling, has been incorporated into Standard R7 of the food standards code, the standard which deals with infant formula. This code has been adopted in all Australian States, other than New South Wales and the Northern Territory. We anticipate that the New South Wales Government should, in an attempt to obtain uniformity with the rest of Australia, adopt the food standards code, and I gather the Australian Capital Territory has already indicated that it will adopt the code and in doing so will adopt this particular provision of it.</PARA>
<PARA> The third measure the Government has taken-an important one in terms of educating the community-is to publish a booklet in 17 languages entitled Baby's First Food. In essence, therefore, the Government's approach in the future, having taken the first two measures with industry and also within the food standards code, will be to concentrate on an educational approach to this area. Together with State Ministers, the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health, to whom I am indirectly related in this portfolio because of our joint interest in the food standards code, will be encouraging State governments to promote educational activities to ensure that the principles of the World Health Organisation code are implemented.</PARA>

Future land use zonings were agreed by the previous State Government. These zonings allow for residential development on the western portion, for recreation and tourism on the range area, with two small areas for open space and recreation and a national park and nature reserve at the headland. The tender process ran from 21 January 1988 to 25 March 1988. Twelve tenders were received.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. Mr President, during Question Time I raised a point of order with you that a statement made by Senator Walsh was disorderly. Apart from not wanting to waste Question Time, my respect for you personally and for the Chair is such that I did not dispute your ruling, but I wish to draw your attention to standing order 418. If you examine Hansard you will see that Senator Walsh's remarks about Mr Peacock in relation to an accountancy qualification were undoubtedly disparaging. Standing order 418 says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Mr President, for a considerable time you have been taking another of the Standing Orders and referring to words being improper. I was not referring to the words being improper; I was referring to standing order 418. With respect, I ask you to look at that standing order, to look at some of the precedents in relation to the use of that standing order, and in future to ensure that Senator Walsh's conduct in this chamber does not personally reflect on members of this chamber or the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Brisbane yesterday the 4QR Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio news at 4 p.m. ran a news story in which a spokesman from Senator Richardson's office described claims I had made in relation to the north Queensland rainforest area as `a load of rubbish which has no basis'. This claim is totally incorrect. The statement I made was based on information from a report entitled Wet Tropics of Queensland: A report to the World Heritage Committee Secretariat, dated September 1988 and prepared by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. My statement indicated that the north Queensland World Heritage area could become a federally controlled territory within a State. I also stated that the Federal Government was threatening to introduce new Federal legislation to give it total control of the area if the State Government did not agree to participate in the cooperative management arrangements. The Government's own report backs up these claims on page 12. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today Senator Walsh again tried to trivialise the fall of $56 in the living standard since this Government came to power in March 1983. He sought to dismiss it in a most simplistic manner by citing average weekly earnings in 1983 compared with now and calculating the tax payable on each amount. If he turns to page 1101 of the Senate Hansard of 30 September 1988 he will see a very comprehensive table showing how a drop of $56 a week in living standards has been calculated by my colleague Andrew Peacock, shadow Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We assert that a family-that is, mum, dad and two kids-earned a total of $370 a week in 1983. That figure compares with an average level of income of $564 a week today. We have taken into account the Medicare levy, the changes which this Government has brought about in the tax rebates for a dependent spouse, the removal of various concessional expenditure rebates for rates and taxes and for health insurance premiums, and the unchanged family allowance. We have also taken into account all other factors relating to social security benefits which might apply to such a family. Lastly, we have applied the consumer price index as the deflator on those incomes in order to calculate the real disposable income for that particular family-and there are a great number of such families suffering under the pressure brought about by this Government's attitude to standards of living. On that calculation, there has been a drop of $56 a week in the real disposable income for this family of mum, dad and two kids. That is what has happened under this Government since March 1983: the real living standards, as measured in terms of cash available to the family on average weekly earnings, has declined by $56 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter how Senator Walsh seeks to dissemble and no matter how he tries to misrepresent the information provided in the Parliament by Mr Peacock and Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, the simple fact remains that that measure of available income for the average family in this country shows quite clearly a fall of $56 a week since March 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes-Adult dead Screw-Worm Flies (SWF) were discovered on one cattle ship in Darwin in September 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> Adult SWF were also trapped on a cattle ship at the port of Darwin in April 1988 and identified in May 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been no reported instances of the larvae of SWF being identified on any ship transporting cattle from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Routine SWF trapping programs have been carried out for many years in areas of greatest risk of entry of SWF from affected countries to the north of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> SWF traps using ``Sworm lure'' attractant are located at strategic sites in the Torres Strait, Cape York Peninsula and in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the recent case of the discovery of SWF on a livestock vessel in Darwin harbour the following additional precautions were implemented:</PARA>
<PARA> sentinel cattle were located at a number of sites within a 50 km radius of Darwin to detect possible SWF infestations and incursions</PARA>
<PARA> regular inspection for SWF and other fly strike in cattle and other animals is carried out at abattoirs, saleyards, mustering points, animal parks and prior to export shipment</PARA>
<PARA> additional SWF trapping devices have been located at strategic sites and at points of high animal concentrations, such as abattoirs, within a 50 km radius of Darwin</PARA>
<PARA> surveillance for myiasis in man is being carried out in co-operation with State Health Departments</PARA>
<PARA> a producer awareness program was initiated to have producers inspect stock, report suspicious cases and to submit samples of larvae for identification.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Current procedures for livestock vessels to ensure freedom from insects are:</PARA>
<PARA> disinfection of the vessel within 48 hours prior to docking</PARA>
<PARA> inspection of the vessel either at, or prior to, the quarantine line which entails</PARA>
<PARA> visual inspection of all livestock compartments, holds and galleys for evidence of live and dead insects</PARA>
<PARA> examination of the Ships Log and empty insecticide containers</PARA>
<PARA> if live insects are observed the vessels will require re-disinfection before docking is approved</PARA>
<PARA> insectocutors are placed on livestock vessels either at the Quarantine line or after docking to assist in the monitoring of the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> These procedures are currently under review by Government and industry to enhance the effectiveness of the disinfection and surveillance procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Monitoring programs at Australian ports vary between southern and northern ports</PARA>
<PARA> in northern ports, insectocutors are placed on the vessels during the time in port and these are inspected and cleaned daily</PARA>
<PARA> in southern ports, limited monitoring as above is undertaken at most ports.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) It is unlikely that there would be any prohibition or restriction placed on livestock or meat exported from Australia should the Screw-worm fly establish in Australia. However it is expected that export livestock would need to be inspected for the presence of SWF larvae.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) No additional costs would be involved for Australian exports as all live animals are currently inspected prior to export.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November 1987 (Hansard, page 2391), Senator Coulter asked Senator Walsh, as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, a question without notice concerning the occurrence of cadmium in Australian food. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia does not have the sort of cadmium pollution that occurs in the industrial countries of the northern hemisphere and therefore the use of the word pollution to describe the Australian situation is somewhat exaggerated. Some incremental cadmium may accrue from the application of fertilizers derived from phosphatic deposits and this may be of significance in areas where other factors, such as soil acidity, favour uptake by plants.</PARA>
<PARA> Directly or indirectly, soil is the source of cadmium for grazing cattle and sheep, but the distribution of high cadmium levels in the kidneys of sheep and cattle is not always correlated with the use of phosphatic fertilizers. The factors governing uptake and accumulation of cadmium in plant and animal tissues are complex and not well understood.</PARA>
<PARA> Kidney levels tend to increase with age, and higher levels are found in females than in males. Kidneys have higher levels than liver and negligible levels are found in muscle.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1986 National Residue Survey found 7 per cent of wheat samples analysed for cadmium to contain more than 0.05 mg/kg of cadmium. In the 1987 survey period only 2.86 per cent of samples were above 0.05 mg/kg. Since that period no further violations on wheat have been reported.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no record of a shipment of Australian wheat being rejected by Sweden because of cadmium contamination. Indeed, the last shipment of Australian wheat direct to Sweden appears to have been made in 1953. Sweden is a net exporter of wheat and is only a small and irregular importer.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1986 National Residue Survey found that 21.3 per cent of sheep kidneys and 12 per cent of beef kidneys sampled exceeded the Australian standard of 2.5 mg/kg for bovine and ovine kidney. The Western Australian data showed 47.1 per cent of sheep kidneys exceeded that level, not 75 per cent as mentioned by the honourable Senator.</PARA>
<PARA> The samples analysed since 1986 show a somewhat lower incidence of levels exceeding the Australian standard. Only 8.6 per cent of sheep kidneys and 4.7 per cent of cattle kidneys had levels above 2.5  mg/kg, while the figures for Western Australia were 26.8 per cent for sheep and 14.7 per cent for cattle.</PARA>
<PARA> The complex issues governing the uptake of cadmium by plants and animals are being investigated by the Bureau of Rural Resources in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in close consultation with State agencies, the CSIRO and the NH&amp;MRC.</PARA>
