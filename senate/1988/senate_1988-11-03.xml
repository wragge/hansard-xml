<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present to the Senate a petitioning letter, bearing 19 signatures, requesting that Colombia's human rights record be placed on the agendas of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations and other major intergovernmental and bilateral government meetings:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, are members of the Sandringham Chapter of Amnesty International, Group No. 318. We are currently involved in a world wide Colombia Campaign to raise public awareness of the situation in Colombia and to exert political pressure for change. Colombian human rights groups have estimated that around 200 people `disappeared' in 1985 after being seized by security forces and that 1000 remain unaccounted for by November 1987. Over 140 `death squads' have been publicly recognized by the authorities but not one person has been convicted for a political killing.</PARA>
<PARA> The long-term aim of this campaign is to stop any further disappearances and political killings and to ensure that all those responsible for the human rights violations are fairly tried by civilian criminal courts. We have the names of 32 people who are currently threatened with death because of their political beliefs. By our actions we intend to save their lives.</PARA>
<PARA> We urge the Australian Government to press for Colombia's record to be placed on the agendas of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations and major intergovernmental meetings, such as those of the Organization of American States, as well as bilateral government meetings. We request you to present this matter to Mr Bill Hayden and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We further request a reply to this letter, stating your views, together with copies of the letter from yourself to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and their reply. Should you desire, we would be most pleased to provide further information or have a representative of Amnesty call on you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Trade Practices (Telecommunications Exemptions) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1988 No. 99 and made under the Trade Practices Act 1974, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>Notice of this motion was originally given by my colleague Senator Messner but it has now been taken over by me. What has happened here is that the Government is moving by way of a regulation and not by way of a Bill, which means that the Parliament is deprived of its right to amend the proposal currently before us. We have, by way of the Standing Orders, the right to disallow these regulations but we have no right to propose amendments. It may very well be that had the Government had the courage to bring in this matter in a Bill-and after all it gave notice of these Trade Practices (Telecommunications Exemptions) Regulations on 25 May, some months ago-we might have been able to accept some parts of it. But the Parliament is now faced with the position of either disallowing these regulations as a whole or allowing them to go through. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that this arrogant and out of touch Government has introduced this measure without any consultation with industry, as it did in relation to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill, yet to be debated in the Senate. This once again demonstrates how out of touch with the people this Government is and continues to be as it administers this country on the basis that it is the sole fount of all wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 May this year the Treasurer, Mr Keating, put down a major economic statement in which he said a number of things with which the coalition parties totally agree. On page 3018 of the House of Representatives Hansard for 25 May, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . economic reforms must extend to every business and workplace in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The way forward for Australia is not to be closeted and sheltered, but to be open and dynamic, trading aggressively in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this kind of economy can provide the employment and rising living standards that Australians aspire to. </PARA>
<PARA>We totally agree with those words, and we wish this Government would fulfil its rhetoric. The Treasurer went on to claim:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the very point of the measures contained in this economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA>As we have indicated from time to time, we have doubts as to whether those measures go far enough. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government will peel away more of this protection. </PARA>
<PARA>He then outlined certain reductions in protection for the private sector. We do not disagree with those proposed reductions. He turned to the public sector, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA> More competitive pressure will also be applied to the operations of Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission to provide better and cheaper services to business and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>Having said that, he went on to introduce these regulations-the Trade Practices (Telecommunications Exemptions) Regulations-which, in fact, do the very opposite of what he had said earlier. The Treasurer said that the Government would apply more competitive pressure, but these regulations confirm and extend the monopoly position of Telecom Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day that the Government introduced these regulations exempting Telecom from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits certain anti-competitive practices and restrictive trade practices, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Transport and communications infrastructure forms the very fabric of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>How right he was. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Without it, the industry could not function, our exports could not reach their markets and we would be limited in our participation in global financial markets and the growing service industries such as tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, accordingly, that every improvement we can make in the way we deliver transport and communications services is vital as this flows through to improvements throughout our economy and assists in improving our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it clear that the coalition parties support those two paragraphs of Senator Evans's statement on these matters. Why then, one asks, has the Government introduced these regulations, which do the very opposite of what Mr Keating and Senator Evans said? The Opposition fully supports these sentiments, but let me make it clear that when we get the opportunity we will act and take the hard decisions which this Government is not yet prepared to take. It may well be that the Cabinet wanted to take the hard decisions here, but of course this Government is locked in by its Caucus committees and that may be the reason why it was unable to implement the words that were uttered by Senator Evans and Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is committed to increase the degree of competition faced by Telecom Australia and that is why Senator Messner gave notice of disallowance. On the day that Senator Messner announced he would move the notice of disallowance, he issued a press release which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's regulations will severely restrict the pace of structural change that is urgently needed in Australia's telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that it was disgraceful for the Government to sneak these regulations through without any consultation with industry or the public. His press release went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not support these regulations as they reduce competition in the telecommunications industry. It is imperative for the development of a fair and competitive telecommunications system that Telecom not be exempted from the operations of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trades Practices Act would provide the competition that is necessary. These regulations exempt Telecom from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I go to the major statement by Senator Evans entitled `Australian Telecommunications Services: A New Framework' which he tabled on 25 May 1988 and in which he referred, for example, to the question of cellular mobile telephone services. He pointed out that it was necessary to face the question of the need for cellular mobile telephone services to remain as a Telecom monopoly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Experience overseas has pointed to possible benefits for that service from competition, including increasing customer responsiveness and faster tech- nological innovation. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what Senator Evans said. He went on to say in paragraph 3.68 of this very large statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Extension of competition to the provision of mobile telephone services themselves would not appear likely to affect Telecom's capacity to fund its community service obligations by cross-subsidies: the services would, in fact, provide additional trunk and local traffic on the Telecom network through interconnection between the mobile services and the basic network infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I thoroughly agree with what Senator Evans said. I ask him: Why, having said that about the cellular mobile telephone service, did he introduce this regulation on the very same day, which prevents competition, and maintains the Telecom monopoly over this service? Senator Evans went on to say later, in paragraphs 3.71 and 3.72:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government considers that there is too much uncertainty to make a decision now to introduce competition . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What an incredible statement! He was saying how great it would be for this nation to introduce competition, yet he also said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government considers that there is too much uncertainty to make a decision now to introduce competition. </PARA>
<PARA>He told us that the Government had decided that further examination of the issue would be required and he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government had decided that: On its establishment the new independent regulatory authority-</PARA>
<PARA>which is now known as Austel-</PARA>
<PARA>will be required to report on the implications of licensing an additional operator of cellular mobile telephone services with rights of interconnection to Telecom's public switched telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will, after receiving that report, review the case for licensing such an additional operator. </PARA>
<PARA>Austel will not come into existence until 1 July next year. It will then conduct an inquiry and, when the Government gets that report, it will start to talk about introducing some competition in this area. We keep saying that this Government is full of rhetoric; it is always telling us how good it is and what it is going to do. It keeps raising the issues but the truth of the matter is that it will not allow this country to get firing in the way it desperately needs to get firing. Senator Button comes in here day after day and talks about the need for manufacturers to go out and do things. But there is a fundamental need for this Government to fix up the infrastructure of this community first in order to give Australian manufacturers, entrepreneurs and people who have the ability an opportunity to go out and do things in this community. Until such time as this Government faces up to the need to do things instead of talking about doing things, this country will not get out of the quagmire that it is currently in, losing money, as it does, at the rate of $1.4m per hour. Every hour of the day, 365 days of the year, this country goes down the drain at the rate of $1.4m. That is, our money we are spending overseas exceeds the money that we are earning by $1.4m an hour. This Government keeps going down at the rate of $10 billion to $11 billion a year. We will not overcome that situation until the Government introduces and implements some of the rhetoric that people like the Treasurer talk about and Senator Evans when he was the Minister for Transport and Communications used to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that, having brought down the statement in May of this year when Mr Keating talked about all of these things, the very next day he had an interview with Mr Geoff Kitney in which he said, `The Government has done all the hard work. Now we have to look at another area', and he raised another area where there is desperate need for reform-that is, the labour market. He said, and rightly so, that there is a massive need to reform the Australian labour market. We again agree with that. But what the Treasurer was saying to Geoff Kitney was that all the hard work in the other areas has been done. This Government seems to think that if it talks about a matter and talks about what needs to be done, it is as if it has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> This regulation that I am asking the Senate to disallow today is a perfect example of that not being true. This regulation in fact continues the restrictions on competition. It does the very opposite of what Mr Keating and Senator Evans were talking about. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has gone on record that the most fundamental reform is yet to come-as if they have reformed things. They have not reformed anything. They have talked about reforming things. They have added a few peripherals and they have changed some of the government business enterprises from a statutory authority to a company. They have changed the external appearances, but the fundamental reforms have not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk about the future of Telecom. What this Government has done under this regulation is to restrict any competition forever in relation to certain areas. The restriction is not just for some period of time. In relation to Telecom being the sole provider of telephone services, the Government has ensured that the monopoly will continue until 30 June 1991. So that monopoly will be carried on until then. In relation to the provision of PABX maintenance and service agreements, that monopoly will be continued until the end of this year. Why? If the Government is prepared to allow competition with that monopoly to start on 31 December this year, why did it not allow the competition to commence from 25 May? What on earth is gained by deferring that competition for those seven months?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on and say that in regard to the shared use and resale of carriage of traffic over private networks, that monopoly is continued forever and similarly with regard to basic switched voice communication services, public switched data services, public switched integrated digital network services, leased circuit services and public mobile telephone services. Those monopolies under this regulation continue forever. There is no date for the commencement of that competition that Mr Keating and Senator Gareth Evans were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> We say to the Government that quite frankly it is just misleading the people when it talks about introducing basic and fundamental reforms. The truth of the matter is that it is not introducing any basic and fundamental reforms. It is talking about that and about the sorts of things that have to be done. The Government subsequently carries on as if it has already done those things. When we are faced with the legislation we know the situation as it actually exists and we know that the reforms have not been carried out. Let me refer to what my colleague the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) in the other place said on 1 November, just a few days ago, in relation to these matters. On page 2141 of the House of Representatives Hansard he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole area of transport and communications, including aviation, is an example of piecemeal, ad hoc policy, driven by partisan considerations and what the factions will allow the Government to do from time to time, depending upon which way the wind is blowing and how they think the opinion polls are standing up. It is not in the best interests of this country, it is not in the best interest of the taxpayers-the people who use the network-and it is certainly operating to the detriment of our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the government business enterprise legislation which will come into this chamber in due course and which I will have an opportunity to talk more about. All that legislation does is talk about the changes at the periphery. Even in the Minister's second reading speech in relation to that matter he acknowledges that the major reforms are yet to come. I see Senator Robert Ray looking at me as if to say that that is not so. That is so. The Minister says it in his second reading speech. He said that the major changes were yet to come and we look forward to them. Why is the Government not bringing them in now? Why did the Government not bring them in on 25 May when it introduced some of these other changes? All the Government did was talk about the major reforms that need to be conducted within the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the problem with the Australian Labor Party is that the factions are interfering with the rhetoric and the polls are probably interfering with the factions. The truth is that, instead of getting on with meaningful reform, this Government is trying to con Australians with rhetoric which obscures the real reasons for these unnecessary regulations. These regulations are not about freeing up the economy and providing more competition for government business enterprises. They are, on the contrary, doing the very opposite of that. On 12 August Senator Evans said of Austel:</PARA>
<PARA> Austel, which will come into being on 1 July 1989, will be responsible for technical regulation of the industry, for protecting consumers against misuse of the carriers' monopoly powers, for protecting the carriers' remaining monopolies, for protecting competitors from unfair carrier practices and for promoting efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>But in the provisions in the regulations which my motion will disallow, if the Senate will carry it, the Government is saying to Telecom Australia that it is all right to infringe the rights of consumers and potential competitors. It is giving Telecom free reign until some time in 1990 or thereabouts when Austel will report. The provisions of the Trade Practices Act-if the Government would only allow them to operate-already protect consumers and competitors from anti-competitive actions by Telecom Australia. But the Government wants to remove that protection with these regulations and, accordingly, they should be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA> These regulations also exemplify another failing of this Government. It cannot get its legislation or regulations right and is continually having to amend its own Bills at the committee stage. We had examples of this in the recent Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and there were many amendments to the national companies legislation package. Honourable senators will recall that the Government had to amend a referendum question because it found it had got it all wrong. I might add that on 3 September we discovered that it had got all the questions wrong. The regulations we are moving to disallow today are also wrong. The Government admitted as much when on 26 August this year it gazetted more regulations to amend these regulations which I am moving to disallow. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that the legality of these regulations will be tested in the courts as they may be inconsistent with the general intent and specific provisions of the Trade Practices Act. All seven of the regulations which are amended cover the conduct of Telecom that is exempted from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. One of the amendments changes a date by two years and the Government says it is due to a drafting error. The reason for the drafting error, of course, is that Cabinet wanted the first phone monopoly to end on 30 June 1989 but the Caucus committee apparently overrode it and gave another two years of protection to Telecom. That is two years at this stage. By that time we will be in government and that will be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the amendments were claimed to address unintended effects of some of the provisions. The Government should get it right when it brings in these Bills and regulations. The amendments to the regulations do not overcome the fundamental problems revealed by the Opposition and we remain totally opposed to the misuse of regulatory powers. The coalition is committed to increasing the degree of competition faced by Telecom. These regulations have the opposite effect, and I call upon the Senate to disallow them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very much struck by the analogy of Liberal Party members being the bogong moths of politics. Here they are, blown off direction, attracted to the first light they come upon, and then hanging around uselessly, just waiting to drop off on these particular issues. I want to respond to three points made by Senator Lewis. What we are considering here is not a blanket exemption for Telecom Australia from the Trade Practices Act. Some of the regulations do have sunset clauses. They will allow phasing in of competition in those areas. Other regulations will provide protection for Telecom only until the new Telecommunications Act is in force. Senator Lewis made a great play of consultation. However, I point out that there were eight months of intensive consultation throughout the policy review process prior to the Government's policy being announced on 25 May. The regulations simply implement the policy reached after extensive consultation with all parties in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis criticises this Government for indecisiveness. He would have us negotiate, consult, make a decision, and then go into another round of consultation. What rubbish. The open-ended regulations protect the basic reserve services which the Government has decided should be reserved to government carriers. The services referred to constitute the national public telecommunications network. If these basic network services are not protected, it will be impossible for Telecom to provide the cross-subsidies which fund universal telephone services to all Australians at reasonable uniform prices. The cross-subsidies enable all rural consumers access to the telephone service at reasonable prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis referred to the fact that the parliamentary Labor Party Caucus committee has had an input into this system. Of course it has. We on this side of the chamber are not ashamed about having elected parliamentarians determine policy. It is not like the system used by the Opposition. It set up an extensive party committee inquiry into immigration. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) then ignored that committee and announced a new policy without reference to it. We do not act in that way. We are a democratic party. Caucus committees have the right to have an input into government. That never happens under the Liberal Party system in which the leader is all powerful. He determines all positions, which means that members of the Opposition toady to that leader or try to replace him, whichever they think is the most operative course for their own career patterns. The sort of toadying, obsequious attitude that we often see on the part of those opposite, is a creature of that system. If Opposition members want to improve their performance, maybe they should implement the Caucus committee system which does have a genuine input into and can change policy. Cabinet is not all knowing or perfect. Why should it not seek the guidance of those Caucus committees?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the more factual part of our approach on this matter. Let us look at the background. The purpose of the regulations is no more than to give effect to the Government's decision that Telecom Australia should continue to exercise a monopoly in those services identified by the Government as being reserved to Telecom. Essentially, the regulations support Telecom's position as the provider of basic telecommunications services and allow a transition period for the introduction of competition in the consumer premises market, pending deregulation. It should be stressed that the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to universal access to standard telephone services throughout Australia on an equitable basis and at affordable prices, in recognition of the social importance of those services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is widely known in the community that Telecom's basic network monopoly has enabled internal cross-subsidies that have supported universal access to standard telephone services at uniform and affordable prices. This has been particularly important to people living in Australia's rural and remote areas. It is quite clear that the Opposition is undecided about supporting universal service and Telecom's ability to cross-subsidise. For instance, Senator Alston, the chairman of the Opposition's privatisation task force, this week called for the privatisation of both Telecom and Australia Post. He also urged reconsideration of Telecom's cross-subsidy arrangements. Senator Alston stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There are no valid public policy reasons why Australia Post and Telecom should be protected from competition and indeed compelling economic efficiency arguments to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA>It would seem to me that Senator Alston believes in the user pays approach to telecommunications, particularly for those people in rural areas. We will no doubt hear from him in a moment. This will come as unhappy news to some rural constituents of his National Party colleagues. Still, one quick course at Monash University really does make a person dry. I am not saying that that course was entirely wasted because I am sure it has improved his knowledge in these areas. Dare I also say that had he gone to a different university we may have heard a different view; I am not sure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, he has it all covered. An immediate effect of disallowing the regulations would be to eliminate the regulatory protection of Telecom's monopolies in specified services where opening them to competition would impose excessive adjustment burdens on the carrier and, just as importantly, the customers. These services are: public switched data; public switched text and video; public switched integrated service digital networks leased circuits; and mobile telephones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regulations also authorise the prohibition of resale or sharing of telecommunication capacity. This is in line with existing practice. The regulations with respect to the above services are intended as a transitional mechanism to protect Telecom's reserved services during the period between the Government's telecommunications policy statement of May 1988 and the passage of the new telecommunications regulation legislation in the autumn session of Parliament in 1989-one might also say the winter session. The new legislation will clearly establish the legal status of Telecom's reserved services monopolies, including the application of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the regulations which exempt certain activities with regard to customer premises equipment are also transitional measures. They allow Telecom to retain certain monopolies with the important proviso that they are subject to sunset clauses. Thus Telecom's monopolies over PABX maintenance and standard telephone handsets will last until 31 December of this year. Its monopoly over the supply of small business systems will end on 30 June 1989. Finally, Telecom's first telephone monopoly will lapse after 30 June 1991 unless--</PARA>

<PARA> These regulations pertaining to customer premises equipment are not arbitrary. They have been specifically designed to allow an adequate transition period for Australian industry pending deregulation of these markets. There is no substance to any of the charges that the regulations will permit Telecom to abuse its monopoly power. Until the establishment of Austel, Telecom is to perform regulatory functions under a Ministerial direction issued on 18 July 1988, which will ensure that Telecom administers its regulations on a fair and non-discriminatory basis and that it does not position itself to unfair advantage in the market. In summary, the regulations are intended as a transitional measure to give full clarification to Telecom's position in the market and to ensure that there are no conflicts between the trade practices legislation and the Government's policies for a new regulatory environment in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to address in responding to the Opposition's disallowance motion is those again oft repeated remarks I have heard in this chamber from Senator Lewis. He says that this Government talks a good game about deregulation but does nothing about it. In a whole range of areas this Government has seen benefit in deregulation. In other areas, it has seen benefit in being interventionist. But the one clear point for anyone with any knowledge of any Australian history and Australian political history is that the great regulationists in this country sit opposite me. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Fraser years from 1975 to 1983, the then Government members were regulation mad. What industries did they seek to deregulate? They initiated a couple of surveys like the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the Bradley Committee of Inquiry into the Monopoly Position of the Australian Postal Commission, as my colleague Senator Maguire reminds me, and then jibbed at any decision making whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia (1982)-Senator Maguire is feeding me my lines perfectly-is another inquiry to note. All these reports recommended deregulation. What did those opposite do in 7 1/2 years? The answer is: absolutely nothing. The new Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate (Senator Stone) was a great regulationist. He was always opposed to deregulation, even the floating of our currency on the international markets. He opposed regulation. There used to be an old saying, `How do you define a Trotskyist?' The answer is, `Simply a Stalinist out of power'. It continued by asking, `How do you define a Liberal?'. The answer is, `Simply a regulationist out of power'. The Opposition has a record of being more interventionist and more protective than any other group. In the end, there is no such thing as a philosophical position really that should support total regulation or total interventionism. It should be applied to the industry and in the circumstances that are necessary at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some industries and in some cases, interventionism happens to be the best way for the public good. In other areas, deregulation happens to be in the interests, to the benefit and for the welfare of the public of Australia. In the telecommunications area, it is very difficult to know where to draw the line. There is a need always for some competition; there is a need for some deregulation: but, in many cases, some of those regulations and some of those monopoly positions can clearly and demonstrably be in favour of the public at large. The absolute assumption that monopoly is per se bad and that oligopoly or whatever follows it is necessarily good is a false assumption. Given such concepts as barriers to entry, quite often a monopoly will give one a cheaper service than an oligopoly. Anyway, I might ask Senator Alston to reflect on that point at this stage. I urge all honourable senators who have not made up their minds-I confess I cannot see any-to support the Government on this position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just to intervene between the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) and Senator Alston's no doubt learned dissertation to come, I rise to say that the Australian Democrats made up their minds on this matter some time ago and we shall not be supporting the disallowance motion before the Senate today. The regulations, which the Opposition is asking the Senate to disallow, allow, as the Minister has said, certain prescribed conduct by Telecom Australia to be exempt from sections 46 and 47 of the Trade Practices Act. These exemptions dealing with Telecom's area of monopoly are in most cases for a limited time, as part of a phasing-in process in the Government's policy of introduction of increased competition in this area, and sunset clauses apply in those cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that these exemptions are absolutely critical in ensuring Telecom's ability to generate sufficient revenue in order to cross-subsidise its less profitable community service obligations. We can argue about what those obligations should include, or about how much cross subsidisation is being done. Is it $200m worth, $600m worth, or more? Those questions are open questions. Answers to them will become clearer in the next 12 months or so as inquiries are undertaken. But what is important is that in that period the regulations should remain in operation. That is why the Democrats will not support the disallowance at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the continuing debate on telecommunications, the Democrats will be repeatedly putting the case for consumers and the need to protect Telecom's universal service obligations. Whilst it is important that government enterprises, public service enterprises, are as efficient as they can be, and whilst aspects of the Government's approach are supported by the Democrats, it is very important that we maintain a strong view of what is best for consumers, and certainly a strong stance on the universal service obligation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted in some of the voluminous literature on this issue some comments by, interestingly enough, Tony Staley, the Chairman of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, on the question of what the Government is doing in its deregulation approach. At a conference in August in Sydney Mr Staley was welcoming the decision to make Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) into companies. To quote him:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the big question is: when budget time comes around will the government live to the rules of the game, or will it behave as governments in the past and rip them off because help is needed with the budget?</PARA>
<PARA>We must remember that Mr Staley has been a member of governments of the past. That is an issue which ought to be raised in this debate when we are talking about increasing the efficiency of a major public enterprise such as Telecom, one which has a universal service obligation, which, as I say, the Democrats strongly support and will work to protect in the interests of the community. The question arises, as Mr Staley has put it, of how government will act in that process, and past performance raises a bit of a worry. The Democrats believe that it is not widely recognised, or not recognised enough, not even by the Government. It would have been comforting to have the Government and the Opposition acknowledge in this debate that Telecom contributes to the Australian economy, and when we are questioning its efficiency or lack of efficiency, the issue of the money that Telecom increasingly-some of these imposts are very recent-puts into our economy needs to be acknowledged. I take this opportunity to acknowledge and welcome the question raised by Mr Staley, and certainly it is a matter that needs far more acknowledgment in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put quite strongly to the Australian Democrats, amongst others, I am sure, that the cellular mobile telephone service should be exempted from this set of regulations. Of course that option is not open to us because we have either to allow or disallow the regulations in toto. But be that as it may, I am not convinced that the replacement of a public monopoly in this instance with what I think would probably simply be a private monopoly, or at best an oligopoly, would really be to the benefit of users. I have not been convinced, even in the cellular mobile telephone area, that had the Government been able to be persuaded to make this particular exemption we would be advancing things, at this time at least, much further. Of course this issue will be inquired into, as has already been said in the debate, by Austel and therefore the Democrats believe it is appropriate that there be no exemption prior to the time Austel reports on the issue. I do not believe there is any prejudging of the Austel inquiry, and I do not think there is any undermining of the independence of Austel, the regulatory body which of course at this stage remains not much more than a twinkle in the eye of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). We have not seen anything too concrete as yet. I take this opportunity, too, to express some concern about that. Nevertheless, the proposal for the exemption of the cellular mobile telephone service is not one with which at this time at least we would be happy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of comments about community service obligations and their cost and productivity. One of the major elements of the Government's whole reform package is establishing how much community service obligations cost. The Government is committed to controlling the level of national resources going to meet social objectives. This is a fine balance that any government has to strike and, as I have said, the Democrats will consistently put the view of the importance of the community service obligation. The Government is looking towards increasing the productivity of the work force in its enterprises of capital and in management systems. It is attempting to keep down the cost of services, and I think no taxpayer and probably nobody in either chamber of this Parliament would disagree with that goal. Nevertheless, it is important that the proper balance be struck and that the economic rationalists do not strike to the extent that they appear to have done within the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> One really wonders how serious members of the Opposition are about this disallowance motion and about telecommunications policy in general. I notice that, according to today's press, the privatisation issue within the Opposition has risen from the grave and that indeed it is a matter for some contention within Opposition ranks. The move being made by the Opposition here, or which at least is being pushed by some in the Opposition, is designed to reduce rural subsidies within Telecom, benefiting the business sector at the expense of ordinary phone users-particularly people in rural Australia. I wonder what Senator Lewis, the current occupant of the job once held by his esteemed colleague Ian Macphee, really thinks about this. I do not know whether Senator Ray forgot momentarily, but Senator Lewis himself is a country lad, as of course I am a country girl. I am not surprised at the reported tensions in the Opposition about this matter. After all, one of the reasons Senator Ray sits on the Government side and Senator Alston, Senator Puplick and Senator Lewis sit on the other side is that country people, and country Victorians in particular, again voted for the Australian Labor Party in government. The swinging seats are the seats of Ballarat and Bendigo, as well as some seats in the metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition seems to be taking a fairly cavalier attitude, particularly when Senator Alston is pushing privatisation at the moment. We all know where Senator Alston stands and I am not at all surprised that he is creating some tension within his own party. I wonder what the National Party members think about it. I wonder whether we will have a National Party speaker in this debate. It looks as though we will not. The National Party benches do seem rather bare. (Quorum formed) As I was saying before the Opposition chose to draw attention to the state of the House, the disallowing of a series of regulations relating to Telecom I think is one of the sensitive issues within Opposition ranks. I was about to speculate on whether this was one of the reasons why, in the current seating arrangements for this chamber, the National Party has chosen not to leave one seat between its members and us. We often hear in this place the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Stone) berate the odious Democrats for being on the far far left of the Left of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the sensitivity of the issue before the Senate is perhaps one of those motivating factors behind leaving one seat vacant between the Liberals and the Nationals in this chamber rather than between the Nationals and the Australian Democrats. As the National Party claims to have, the Australian Democrats do have great concern for isolated and underprivileged Australians. Indeed, as we have seen in the last few minutes, this is a matter of great sensitivity. Whatever members of the National Party think about this matter, they can be assured that until within the Opposition they knock the idea of privatisation on the head, I and my Democrat colleagues will continue to travel around the part of the country which they claim is theirs telling country people about their betrayal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by mentioning some comments by Mel Ward, the Managing Director of Telecom Australia, who takes the view, as do the Australian Democrats, that telecommunications policy must always be transitional because of the rate of change in this field. As I have said, this is an extraordinarily sensitive area in which to have government attempting to introduce profitability and competitiveness, along with the continuing provision of community service. In the case of these regulations we believe that the Government has displayed a sensitivity to the needs of Telecom. In the current context we believe these regulations should and must stand. Indeed, they will stand because the Australian Democrats will not support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be extremely brief. I will support the disallowance motion and will do so for one reason and one reason alone. My reason is not related necessarily to the subject matter of the Trade Practices (Telecommunications Exemptions) Regulations. I will support the disallowance motion because the Government has brought in quite a wide range of changes in the form of regulations. It would have been more appropriate had it introduced legislation to effect these changes so that that legislation would then be the subject of scrutiny by the Parliament. Members of parliament would then have the opportunity to consider the clauses of such a Bill at the committee stage. They would be able to amend them if they chose to do so in order to improve the legislation, either by deleting certain clauses or adding thereto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is something to which the Senate itself should have regard when it considers regulations and subordinate legislation such as we have now. The regulations procedure inhibits the function of members of parliament because when a regulation such as this is placed before us we have only two options-either to agree to it or to disallow it. We cannot amend it. We may support some parts of the regulation while we may vigorously oppose other parts. What sort of situation are we placed in when we have only Hobson's choice or none? That is not an appropriate way to deal with major questions. This is a diminution of our functions of audit and control and that is why I propose to support the disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Trade Practices (Telecommunications Exemptions) Regulations because I believe they are matters of considerable public importance. It is regrettable in the first instance that the Minister for Local Government, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, is not present to hear my remarks because I wished to provide him with some enlightenment. He trotted out a number of fairly moth-eaten comments and assessments which clearly reflected the fact that he had not read my remarks and was at a very early stage of development in terms of the policy debate. I intended to offer him the option of a crash course at the summer school at Monash University, where he might have been able to learn the difference between privatisation and competition. That is really what these regulations are about and what the public debate should be about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regulations provide a mechanism for protecting not simply the basic network but also other areas that are not in any way crucial to maintenance of that network. In particular, there is the first phone monopoly which, Senator Ray has said, has a sunset clause attached to it and has to be subject to review within six months of the end of 1989. As we well know, the Caucus liaison committee, headed by my good friend Roger Price, was able to achieve a number of significant backdowns by the task force and I have no confidence at all that logic or economic sensibility will prevail. Indeed, the whole approach of the Government is typified by these regulations because there has not been any desire to have these matters debated in the public arena. The establishment of the task force in the first instance was essentially a private inquiry. The interaction of that committee with the Caucus liaison committee was quite unprecedented and undesirable, resulted in a number of unfortunate compromises, and ultimately led to a secret report again being provided to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and a statement being tabled reflecting the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> I will develop that point to its conclusion. The process adopted by the Government in this area is, I believe, very unhealthy because at the crux of the whole question of community service obligations and cross-subsidies is the nature, extent and true cost of Telecom Australia's cross-subsidies. Yet we are no closer at all to getting to the bottom of that conundrum. The Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia in 1982 reflected quite adversely on Telecom's estimates of the extent of cross-subsidy. From memory, I think Telecom estimated it to be in the vicinity of $290m. Since that time we have had ever increasing estimates. In Telecom's annual reports in recent years it has talked about the extent of the cross-subsidy being of the order of $600m. In a press release put out last December, Telecom suggested that it was of the order of $1 billion. In its submission to the task force, I am reliably informed that at one stage Telecom was arguing that a figure closer to $2.5 billion could be arrived at, depending on what measure was adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, ultimately the Minister's statement comes down to this: `Telecom claimed that the extent of its cross-subsidy was $670m; on the other hand, we have an official estimate that it may well be only $250m. In the circumstances we are quite unable to determine the extent of the cross-subsidy and we therefore believe it is a matter requiring further investigation'. Accordingly, that question was referred to the Bureau of Transport and Communications but, once again, for a private inquiry. That is currently under way and has been for some months. If one is familiar with the `capture thesis', it is intriguing to note that Telecom has been `providing assistance' to Telecom during that period but the Bureau has not yet engaged the services of independent consultants in order to test the information being provided by Telecom, let alone take on board some of the international data in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at yet another private report to the Minister in due course. There is no obligation for it to be released or for the Minister to accept it. No doubt there will be every opportunity for the Caucus liaison committee, Senator Childs and a number of others to kick it to death if it in any way suggests that the extent of the cross-subsidy might be relatively modest. If it is of the order of $250m, as postulated by the task force, then it is eminently achievable without the need to maintain the iron clad grip of monopoly on a whole range of Telecom services-not just the basic network. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that, until these regulations were proclaimed, Telecom had been staunchly denying that it was even subject to the Trade Practices Act. It was established in the Federal Court of Australia about 18 months ago, in the case of Tytel, that it was. But Telecom never accepted that result and persuaded the Government not to take further action to ensure that its monopoly was protected by law. </PARA>
<PARA> In the aftermath of the May statement the Trade Practices Commission recommended that the way in which to proceed was to seek an exemption under the Trade Practices Act. But, of course, that was very quickly rejected by the Government because, again, it would have involved a public inquiry. The Trade Practices Commission could have required all interested parties to present submissions, to canvass the real issues and to decide on the extent of the level of cross- subsidies. But no, the Government chose to ignore that advice and it went down that surreptitious back passage that concerned Senator Harradine to the extent that he is supporting us in our motion of disallowance, and he is absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no justification at all for presenting the Parliament with an all or nothing choice. Indeed, there are some areas that are much more significant than others. There are some sunset clauses attaching to the regulations, but it is very interesting to note that there is no sunset clause attached to any of those areas provided for in paragraph 4 (f) of the regulations dealing with prescribed conduct. These areas include not just the basic network, which is basic public switched voice telecommunications services, but also public switched data. There is no justification at all for an absolute protection in that area. Again, public switched text has nothing to do with what we ordinarily understand to be the basic network, the basic voice transmission that is encompassed in the rubric of universal service. I concede that public switched integrated services digital networks and leased circuits are an integral part of the monopoly because once we allow leasing and buying of excess capacity we certainly undermine the price monopoly position of Telecom. But the most outrageous area of all-even Senator Powell referred to it-is the public mobile telephone services. It is an open secret that the task force was very much inclined to take that out of the monopoly area but ultimately, of course, Caucus prevailed and it is in there. But it is in there without limit. There is no sunset clause attaching to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose in due course the economic inevitability and utter irrationality of maintaining the present position will become apparent and mobile telephone services will be opened up to the public. We can buy the equipment now; there is plenty of competition in that market. But it is the actual service and its interconnection with the network that is absolutely protected. As a result, we are paying about 40 per cent more than we need to pay. When we take account of import duties and purchasing power parity arrangements we can make fairly direct comparisons with the United States position. It has been a growth area of enormous dimensions around the Western world yet, for no good reason, it is thrown in there to protect the monopoly. It is thrown in there because it is an area of easy money for Telecom. Telecom knows that there is a great demand for this service. There is no particular reason why it provides it better than anyone else, but it is free money for Telecom and that is why that is in there. I find that a thoroughly undesirable justification for including it in these regulations. These regulations are not just a response to the Tytel case and other legal advice that the Government has obtained that the basic network needs specific protection; they go well beyond the protection of the basic network. </PARA>
<PARA> I was intrigued by Senator Powell's comment that somehow we are pulling the rug out from those in rural and remote areas. I hope she does not pretend that Ballarat and Bendigo come under that category. Undoubtedly, there is a whole range of beneficiaries of cross-subsidies who do not reside in country areas. I think we all know that subscriber trunk dialling between major capital cities provides the vast bulk of the cross-subsidy. That is where the revenue comes from. If we live in urban areas and if we are users of the local network we are beneficiaries. People in rural and remote areas are beneficiaries. There is a range of beneficiaries who are deserving, to a greater or lesser extent, irrespective of their need. Irrespective of whether I need to have my telephone calls subsidised in metropolitan areas, I am a beneficiary. If I wanted to start up a new multi-million dollar tourist resort on the islands off Queensland and I regarded it as purely a commercial venture, the most I would have to pay for a telephone service would be $1,425, even though the actual cost of installation is likely to be in the region of $20,000 or $25,000 and, in some remote areas, in excess of $30,000. A person running a big commercially operated cattle station in the Northern Territory can get a phone connected for that figure. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be exposed as a charade is that we talk constantly about universal service as though it is something that is desperately in need of protection. But we never define what is meant by `universal service'. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is now talking about universal service on the basic network having been achieved. Indeed, if we make comparisons we find that Australia is better off than most OECD countries. It has nothing to do with the fact that we have fairly sparse population distribution in a number of areas. The fact is that 93 per cent of households are already connected to the basic network. There are 44,000 rural and remote subscribers and, of those, all but 7,000 have been connected to the network. Those 7,000 would probably each need to pay in the order of $10,000 if they were to be responsible for their own connections, and no-one would suggest that. But at the moment it is possible that the connection costs could be of the order of $30,000. That has a lot to do with the fact that, at the moment, we have a very cosseted and over-staffed service. </PARA>
<PARA> If people were allowed to make their own arrangements to install their own connections, up to a point; if they were able to engage their own outside labour-and there are plenty of technicians who would be more than willing to accommodate them-it is my view that the cost could be substantially reduced. To the extent that government is justified in providing subsidies-I willingly accept that there are very many areas where people are genuinely in need of government assistance-that assistance can be provided at a much reduced cost. That is what this exercise is all about. It is sheer disinformation and distortion to pretend that somehow this debate is about removing cross-subsidies and subsidies. It might be about removing cross-subsidies; it is certainly not about removing subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend strongly that if we want to have a more efficient delivery mechanism we should identify the extent of community service obligations, we should identify those who are in need of assistance and we should then determine the most efficient way of providing that assistance. We can do that in a variety of ways. For example, in the United Kingdom British Telecom has a licence which requires it to provide services to rural and remote areas. They might not be as extensive as they are in Australia, but, undoubtedly, there are a number of areas where services are provided below cost. British Telecom does not ask for any government assistance to do that; it is unfamiliar with the notion of community service obligations requiring cross-subsidies or requiring any direct government subvention. It wears it quite willingly as a means of achieving universal coverage and it does that because, at the moment, it has a very tiny competitor in Mercury which has been prohibited for some five years from getting into the market in a decent way. But the reality is that, in due course, Mercury will acquire a greater degree of involvement in the market. It will not be the dominant player any more than Telecom will cease to be the dominant player in a competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear Senator Powell say that Mel Ward, the Managing Director of Telecom, had said that telecommunications is constantly in a state of transition. I thoroughly agree with those remarks, but I find them slightly inconsistent with the suggestion of the Australian Democrats that somehow we are all about change and what is needed is to maintain the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are about transition and if we are about acknowledging what is going on in the rest of the world, then we have to understand that the reason why the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan have moved to open up their networks to extensive competition is that otherwise, inevitably, there is going to be major bypass of the existing network. It is already happening in this country. Four of the States have already established private networks under various names. Some of us would remember Q-NET in Queensland. Senator Jones no doubt remembers Q-NET. That now I think has been sold off to the private sector. But the reality is that each of those State government instrumentalities and public service areas has been anxious to avoid using the public network because of the unnecessary cost that is involved, and because they are required to be unwilling subsidisers, that practice will increasingly expand. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be found that Telecom's major corporate customers, which it now regards as a discrete group of 200 to 300, will increasingly want to bypass the basic network and they will be then opting out of the system. To the extent that they do, Telecom's capacity to cross-subsidise will be markedly reduced. It has been reduced by some hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years as a result of the activities of State governments, many of them Labor governments. Visitel in Victoria is a State Labor government creation. That is going to go on happening. It will happen in Western Australia. It will happen in South Australia and in New South Wales. It will happen, not because people have ideological hang-ups or because they think it is about time they did something different: it will happen because there are irresistible economic imperatives that drive people to look for the lowest cost service. As that happens, Telecom's ability to maintain the cross-subsidy will be substantially reduced and the squeeze will be well and truly on; those people who are in need of subsidy services will be squeezed by Telecom's inability to maintain them, unless it puts up the prices more and more, and to the extent that it does there will be much greater consumer dissatisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> While Senator Powell is here I would like to deal with an inquiry that is currently being undertaken by the Commission for the Future. I think there is an acceptance in this chamber that it would be very helpful to understand the true cost of Telecom's cross-subsidies because it is basic to the whole notion of whether one needs to protect Telecom from competition. I take the view that if Telecom is exposed to competition a number of efficiencies will very rapidly manifest themselves. There will be a considerable reduction of costs, probably because a number of people will cross over to the private sector and not be encumbered by present restrictive public sector arrangements. That, in itself, would contribute to a marked reduction of costs. It would not necessarily put people out of work but it would put them into more productive areas where they would probably be self-employed rather than being part of the almost 90,000 employees of Telecom at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Commission for the Future is proposing at the moment is a fundamentally flawed inquiry. The Commission for the Future is presently suggesting that it should look at the notion of community service obligations. It told a Senate Estimates Committee that it was only looking at them in the non-voice transmission area, but that is not what its project outline says. What I found even more extraordinary was that it is not particularly concerned with costs; in other words, it is looking to see whether one can extend the notion of community service obligations without having regard to the cost of delivering them. Community service obligations are all tagged. What are we on about? Are we on about providing services and maintaining good quality services to all those people who need them? If we are, then I think everyone is in heated agreement. That must always continue to be the case. To the extent that people might be jeopardised by any cost increases, then they have to be assisted in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not about pretending that somehow we have not got a 93 per cent penetration rate; that there are remarkably few people who do not have phones who want them. The fact is that last year some 618,000 new connections were achieved and Telecom is basically meeting the demand. Telecom is taking it upon itself to extend connections and no doubt what it wants to achieve by this Commission for the Future exercise, for which it is offering funds at the present time, is a respectable basis for discovering a whole new area of community service obligations which it can then proceed to willingly undertake and argue that it needs the monopoly protection to maintain the cross-subsidy arrangement. It is a highly inefficient way of doing business. It is out of touch with the rest of the world. It is not happening in any other Western nations. We are going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> What I argue is that we should be exposing Telecom to competition. Let us not worry about privatisation; privatisation is an option that has been exercised in other Western countries and certainly in terms of price and quality the results are there to see. All I can say is that that is one of the most effective ways of opening up the system. But let us not follow the British path. One does not transform a public sector monopoly into a private sector monopoly or a dominant carrier as happened with British Telecom. I do not think that was a desirable approach. I am not arguing privatisation. I am arguing exposure to competition and that is what the exercise is all about. If one looks at whether there are certain areas that still need to be the special concern of government, and I am sure that there are, there are ways in which one can achieve the maintenance of those community service obligations other than by cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA> One does it, firstly, by either a direct subvention from the Budget, so that it is transparent, so that people understand what the true cost is and one knows precisely what is involved, or by an internal levy on all telecommunications users. One can in fact provide the subsidies not just to the service provider; one can provide them, for example, to local municipalities which might also be prepared to expend some of their own funds on providing additional public phone boxes or local connections. One could provide it by way of a rebate to individual users. One could provide a lifeline service, as they do in the United States, where they have a specific fund that involves taking money from the long distance carrier and reallocating it to the local exchange. They do that in order to maintain community service obligations, although they do not use that term. But they do it to keep rates down, to ensure that people can afford to remain connected to the basic network. </PARA>
<PARA> We would never want a situation in which people were denied the opportunity to have ready and affordable access to public telephones. I am always reminded of Marilyn Monroe's poignant cri de coeur when she described the telephone as her only real friend. I think there are many people in the community who do find the telephone a source of great solace, as those who have teenage children understand. They include the aged and a whole range of people and even politicians, I suppose. There is, no doubt, no shortage of Tiberiuses on both sides of the House. We all know that a telephone is not just a business instrument. A telephone is a basic socialisation tool and it is a fundamentally necessary means of communication at all levels. The last thing anyone would want to do is to jeopardise that. But what I think we must be on about and what I think these regulations manifestly fail to address is that as long as we continue to protect Telecom and to give it this carte blanche to continue to be a monopoly provider under the guise of meeting all of these very vaguely expressed community service obligations, the Government will ensure that it has an inefficient system, with no price competition and that people will be compelled to look for ways and means of bypassing the network and making use of a whole range of other creative systems as they are doing at the moment. The end result will be a bigger and less sustainable dinosaur that will eventually fragment and collapse under its own weight. That is not the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> These regulations do nothing to impose any disciplines on Telecom. Quite the opposite. They do not allow for any measure of competition or efficiency. They do not subject Telecom to any real pressure. They do nothing but protect and expand a monopoly which is basically going in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. I regard it as regrettable. I also regard it as regrettable that there are those who either do not understand or who do not want to understand that exposing Telecom to competition has nothing to do necessarily with privatisation. If one is interested in delivery of services at the lowest possible cost then there are very many ways and means of achieving that, the least of which is to maintain the monopoly in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that there will be enough people in the community who will understand that those of my colleagues in the National Party of Australia and those in rural and remote areas are not under threat at all. They will be the beneficiaries, as will all of us, who find that a telephone is an essential means of allowing daily activity. As long as that remains the case-it always will be-we all will have a vested interest in the provision of those services at the cheapest possible cost. Those who pretend that somehow this debate is simply about privatisation and who use that as an excuse to perpetuate the monopoly do Australians a great disservice, make us much less competitive internationally and reduce Telecom's opportunities of becoming a more thrusting and vigorous enterprise. I note in passing that it was unsuccessful in achieving a contract in Thailand yesterday. It has a very poor track record when it comes to exports. Telecom will not be the beneficiary of this outmoded arrangement and certainly the Australian consumer will be the loser. </PARA>

No separate annual report for this Authority is to be prepared for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, although the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office is also similarly listed under the same heading in the introduction to the DITAC draft annual report, the department confirmed with the Committee that the office is covered under the DITAC annual report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the adjournment of the debate last night I was discussing the development of the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme, the changes in its use, the two inquiries conducted in 1988-one by the Bureau of Industry Economics and one by Price Waterhouse-the basis of satisfactory encouragement of schemes of this nature, the shortcomings of the present scheme and, of course, the famous undertakings of both the then Minister for Trade, Mr Dawkins, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that were made the week before the last election. Taking those factors into account, we must remember that Australia has export sales for 1987-88 amounting to $40.8 billion. A scheme of this nature must clearly provide inducements and initiation to new exporters rather than rewards for those that are already in. While rewards are appreciated, it is much more valuable to provide inducements to new people to encourage them to start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is up to the Government to create confidence in an export culture. For instance, we have noted the increase in the value of the Australian currency since yesterday and we have to consider again what this will do to the exporters of today. It is very difficult for them to face this fluctuating and fiddled currency. There have been several changes in the policy, and the Bill before us now shows that Government undertakings are absolutely meaningless. I remind the Senate of the 1990 guarantee that has been referred to.

<PARA>Export Market Development Bill</PARA>
<PARA>I have written to all recipients of EMDGS assuring them that the Hawke Government regards the scheme as an integral part of Australia's export effort . . . I have also assured them that we will not undermine that effort by chipping away at the spearhead of Australia's export drive, Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that the Prime Minister has done exactly the same thing, saying that export assistance programs are particularly valuable to small and medium sized businesses attempting to enter foreign markets. We are getting these sorts of undertakings but we are not getting the actions to go with them. The undertakings industry has received are absolutely meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> The elimination of New Zealand as an area from which refunds may he obtained is significant, and I accept that this is one of the areas of closer economic relations that we have to follow through. However, it was not one of the things that the people who were involved in the EMDG scheme were told, and that makes it difficult. Senator Chaney raised this issue last evening and several people have raised it with me. They have done the right thing. They have set up export programs. They have tried to work through the scheme in every way, but suddenly they find that the system has been changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The raising of the minimum expenditure threshold is one of the issues. Clearly, from the instructions that were given to Price Waterhouse and the Bureau of Industry Economics, the whole point was to see how much they could reduce expenditure. If there had to be changes of this magnitude, 1990 is not so far away and it would have been time enough then to make the changes or abolish the scheme, as seems much more likely. The performance test is quite anomalous, and it fails to take account of the differences between resource sales and service contracts. Some sales can be made immediately; some may take two or three years to build up. It is very difficult to know how far down the track some of these contracts may be. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the grant ceiling reduction, if export is our aim the ceiling should have been restored to real value, but it was reduced. Submitting export marketing plans is clearly a very good idea. I have no objection to including it in the legislation, as I have no objection to the cost of language training being deductible. The corporations grouping question will be hard to arrange but I believe it is desirable. It is unreasonable that one entity should have multiple bites at the grants scheme. Similarly, I believe that the new ownership clause is not unreasonable in any way. However, I regret that prior to 1990 the Government has deleted the very small potential exporter with a budget of less than $10,000. It takes time for a small business to grow into a big business. Anything that could encourage exports should be provided. There is a famous case in my own area of a very small operator who makes fruit cakes and exports them to about 26 countries. However, it is very difficult for small businesses to get started because there is very little help for them. I regret that the only thing this legislation does not say is that the Government's real intention is to save $52m and to do that at the expense of losing faith with the employers of 700,000 people generating sales of $5.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have considerable interest in exports; I always have had. It is not because I represent Tasmania but because relatively Tasmania is a most efficient exporter and earner of export income. Tasmania exports many products-agricultural and manufactured products, many different minerals such as gold, zinc, copper, silver, iron, lead, and so on, a range of wood and wood products, wool, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, essential oils, live animals, and meat. Of course, its per capita export figure is considerably higher than the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Act provides for the claiming of costs such as advertising, overseas representations, participation in exhibitions, overseas travel, and bringing agents or buyers to Australia, and covers goods with at least a 50 per cent Australia content, plus various service activities and industrial property rights. The present termination date is 30 June 1990. What will happen then? When will exporters know what will happen in the future? Most exporters are making plans for well past 1990, anyway. I think it is time that the Government let them know whether there will be a scheme in the future and, if so, what sort of scheme it has in mind. When will the Government tell exporters what its future plans are? I implore the Government to announce its plans this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed recently that Senator Button, in one of the great throwaway lines that he makes at various times, commented that export markets estimated to be worth over $2 billion annually by the year 2000 have been identified for value added production of wool, sheepskins, hides and cotton. It is all very well to make those sorts of statements but, if we are to export $2 billion worth of value added products, what will happen to the markets that we already have? Are the markets for the manufactured products expected to be the same as the markets for the raw products? Will we change the whole basis of our trade with some of these countries? It is all very well to make such statements when one has no intention of backing them up by assisting the people that one expects suddenly to enter such a large trading area. </PARA>
<PARA> During Estimates committee hearings I asked various questions about the scheme and how it was working. I was told that 22 per cent of the grantees in the last financial year were first year applicants. What I would like to know, and what I could not find out then, was: with the changes that are proposed, what is the figure expected to be this year? I was not given any answer to that question. It surprises me that apparently there has been no research into trying to find out what the changes are likely to do to our export industries. When I questioned officers on how many of these applicants would have been exporters without the EMDG scheme I received no response. I also asked what issues new exporters were raising, in order of importance. Again, there did not seem to be very much information available. I raised whether the cost of servicing representation with regard to 4,150 recipients of the grant was approximately $500 per advance. I was told that the costs were a worry. </PARA>
<PARA> One area where real help is needed, and needed urgently, is in product liability insurance. I received some helpful advice only today from Austrade, but nothing that would facilitate a few billion dollars worth of exports of new products to new markets. What will the Government do to assist in this area? In the meantime, plenty of potential new exporters are staying out of the trade, and staying out in hundreds. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, it would be best if, as far as possible, the expenses of the scheme were applied to grants rather than administration costs. The $500 per grantee servicing cost is a very high figure. However, the services of Austrade are necessary and they must be good. Its officers must be capable and experienced in trade and industry. I am very pleased with the progress that has been made by Austrade. Earlier this year I visited several Austrade stations and am happy to give them high commendation. I have spoken with many exporters and export groups around Australia. They are very keen, enterprising and anxious to proceed. However, they must be told what to expect in the future. Clearly, we need maximum contact with them to learn from their practical experience. I want the exporters themselves to determine the issues that induce the development of export trade. With limited funding we need advice on how and where that funding is best spent. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question I raised last night: will the Government's Bill encourage industry to export? I cannot see that it will. I think it is quite deplorable that this should be so when the balance of trade is against us. I noticed in today's daily commercial news that there has been a further slide in the value of our export products. The slide is not very big but it represents a trend. It is down quite a lot since the peak in April. Our imports continue to rise in price; our exports are decreasing in price. What is the Government doing except cutting off assistance to exporters? The Government must stand by the fact that it has broken the undertaking it gave to exporters. It has offered nothing to exporters by way of replacement or substitution of the scheme from 30 June 1990 and it has produced no policy which exporters can work from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Today we are debating the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1988. Despite the fact that the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, I cannot miss the opportunity to express my concern about the Government's handling of the administration of the scheme. Uncertainty in small businesses trying to develop export markets is rife. The Hawke Government seems not to have heard of the concept of lead time. Only last month we saw flower growers, who have planted particular varieties for export, facing a 38 per cent freight charge imposed by Qantas Airways Ltd. This increase has made it almost impossible for flower growers to compete on European markets. The freight charges increased the cost of sending one flower from 7.2c to 11c. Freight charges amounted to 30 per cent of the total costs. This is just another example which would deter other enterprising flower growers taking the risk of planting varieties of flowers for export.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already mentioned before the problems faced by the creative speciality cheesemakers in my State. Small businessmen are beavering away at producing products which have the potential both to replace imports and to be exported. The export of these cheeses is nigh impossible because of the costs involved in meeting the government regulations-regulations which are far more stringent for the export market than the domestic market and far more stringent than those to which cheeses imported into Australia are subjected. In the amendment to the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme we have another example of the carpet being pulled from under small businesses which are attempting to assist, in their own small but important way, to improve this country's disastrous balance of payments figures. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) he noted that the scheme is to be terminated on 30 June 1990. This is less than two years away. Significant changes are being implemented so close to termination, and there are no details of what the Government will put in place if it remains in power. I guess that it will not have the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes announced in the May statement and implemented five weeks later showed the typical ill-conceived, roughshod approach we have come to expect from this Government. The very real problems of these changes were brought home to me on a recent trip to rural Victoria where I visited a businesswoman and her husband and saw their small enterprise, developed out of their garage, and which now, as a result of her creativity and their joint energy, employs 11 full time and 24 part time workers. They have already made one promotional trip to New Zealand in May-June this year. As a result of the first trip they were reasonably confident of picking up one of the major duty free chains in New Zealand. The committed themselves to a further trip in July-August 1988 only to find the Government's game plan changed almost overnight and they were no longer eligible, just as they were cutting their export teeth in New Zealand. Having had their fingers burnt once, they might be less inclined to make plans to move into other export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear Senator Archer refer to Senator Button's comments about value added wool exports. The small business to which I have referred tried to create the very thing that Senator Button is asking for-value added exports. These creative people, creating jobs in rural Victoria, have had the carpet ripped from underneath their feet. The indecent haste with which these changes have been introduced has had a disruptive effect on people trying to plan their business affairs and it has acted as a disincentive for exporters to invest to improve their access to export markets. This comment applies to other incentive programs as well. If a subsidy can change overnight, and there is no guarantee that it will continue after 1990, exporters can hardly be motivated to spend money to develop their products and their markets. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a parallel here with research and development expenditure. The kinds of exports and import replacing industries that the Government wants Australian business to develop will not succeed unless the products are right and the markets are right. The two go hand in hand. The importance of research and development is being stressed again and again by the Government and its Ministers Button, Jones and Dawkins. Senator Button laments the unwillingness of private companies to invest in research and development, while the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, argue about the relative contribution of the public and private sectors and the areas to which these funds should be attracted. The current debate between Jones and Dawkins should be cold comfort for universities now subjected to increasing control over the allocation of their research funds. This Government's philosophy is that it knows best how and on what research money should be spent even if the Ministers cannot agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The export development scheme has been subjected to four significant reviews in the last three years. There was the Ferris report-the report of the national export marketing strategy panel in 1985. The amendments suggested by it were only accepted in part. In 1987, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts called for submissions from Austrade on the improvements in administration of the scheme following an audit report. In January this year, we had a reference given by the Government to the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) to review the scheme. It was requested to report to Senator Button, the Minister, by 31 March 1988. In fact the report was finally presented in May-the same month as the economic statement-which foreshadowed the legislation under discussion. Indeed the legislation was presented to the other place the same night as the May economic statement. The BIE report was not released until September 1988, four months after the legislation was introduced. Also, in 1988, Austrade commissioned the Price Waterhouse organisation to assist in assessing the scheme's progress. This report has not been released. The Minister told an Estimates committee only last month that it was his decision as to whether and when it would be released. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of tinkering-let me say quite expensive tinkering-in terms of both the cost of reviews and the cost to the exporters caught in the changes, has gone on and yet this is a scheme which is operating under a sunset provision in the relevant legislation. The claim is that these changes will make the scheme cost effective. What costs and disincentives are being imposed on exporters resulting from the constant changes and constant uncertainty? The point of all these reviews essentially has been to save money. The BIE report claims that there is an economically justifiable case for export support but we cannot afford the scheme as it is. It has suffered from chronic budget overruns, and this is not the fault of the exporters. It is the fault of the Government which has repeatedly failed to frame its Budgets properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme has open access. This means that any exporter who meets the qualifying requirements is eligible to apply for a grant. The cost overruns have varied between 14.3 per cent and 46 per cent of the aggregate grants paid. for 1988-89, the Government has appropriated $109m, the same as in the Budget for 1987-88. In fact, in 1987-88, the Government had to seek an additional appropriation of $64m to meet the legitimate claims of exporters. This year, the explanatory notes provided to the Senate Estimates Committee once again showed a shortfall of an expected $64m. As the claims paid in the current financial year relate to the exports generated in the previous financial year, there is every probability that, early next year, the Parliament will be asked to appropriate another $64m at least. So, the Hawke Government cannot even get the numbers right for past exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also tried to obscure the truth about this current legislation. In the May economic statement this year, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA>The way forward for Australia is not to be closetted and sheltered, but to be open and dynamic, trading aggressively in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>This sounds like a call to spend more money on helping exporters-not less. In the papers attached to the May economic statement we read:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to amend the export market development grants scheme to improve its cost effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, a reasonable person might read this as meaning that the same amount of money is to be spent but in better ways. The Public Service has finally blown the whistle on the Government. The explanatory notes to Estimates Committee A state freely:</PARA>
<PARA>As part of the May Economic Statement the Government amended the EMDG scheme from 1/7/88 to reduce its cost. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. There is nothing about improving Australia's export performance and nothing about spending money in better ways. These amendments are presented for one simple purpose-to reduce its cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Opposition does not object to containing or reducing costs and at the same time making the scheme more effective, but not on five weeks notice and not at the expense of small businesses often working from scratch to build up export earnings. The current scheme has been continually patched up and there have been cost overruns in every budget. If a new EMDG or similar post-1990 scheme is planned, the lesson that has been learnt from the current scheme is that adequate checks and balances should be in place from the start and not introduced willy-nilly throughout the course of the program. If that were to be done, the uncertainty created by the adhockery of the present scheme would be avoided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sound management of Government finances requires cuts in unnecessary and wasteful spending and especially in non-productive expenditure. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1988 that we are now debating fails to meet those criteria. This Bill is an unjustified cost cutting exercise. At a time when the Australian dollar has appreciated in value by around 20 per cent over a three- to four-month period against our major trading partners, the Government is pulling the plug on assistance to exporters to finance, among other things, its vote getting cuts on beer excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Containment of our massive trade deficit is, as we all know, contingent upon a continuing increase in our level of exports. The Australian dollar is currently over 82c of the United States dollar-the highest it has been for some time. This makes our exports more expensive, less competitive and therefore harder to sell. The value of imports is increasing at more than double the annual rate of increase in the value of exports. Our economy simply cannot continue to sustain this deficit increase for much longer. Yet we have before us a piece of legislation which, although masquerading as an improvement to the export market development grants scheme, is a gross act of sabotage. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces changes which will allow fewer people to be eligible for the scheme which virtually eliminates small business, totally cuts out one trading area and will cause many exporting companies considerable financial hardship. The need for assistance in establishing overseas markets has been recognised by a succession of Federal governments and all the major business organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former Minister for Trade, Mr Dawkins, have made categoric statements on the need for maintaining export assistance. Mr Hawke has given his personal guarantee that the pre-election promises that he made regarding the continuity of the export market development grants scheme would be met. In a letter to the exporting companies in June 1987, the then Minister, Mr Dawkins, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, gave me his personal assurance that a returned Hawke Government would continue the EMDG Scheme and sustain the efforts of Austrade. The Hawke Government is determined to give its full support to help Australian businesses selling overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite all this, the Hawke Labor Government is introducing changes that will drastically alter the effectiveness of the export market development grants scheme and which will undermine the export potential of Australian industry. With the present Prime Minister undermining his credibility in this way, no wonder Minister Dawkins has become the Keating-for-Prime Minister-now campaign manager. By changing the rules in the middle of the game, the Government could seriously damage Australia's international trading credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasing success of the export market development grants scheme is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, in the  1986-87 financial year, each cash grant dollar yielded $41 of export income, an increase of $3 from the $38 yielded in the previous financial year for each dollar of cash grant. In addition to the hard export dollars earned there are many intangible benefits, such as knowledge of overseas markets, increases in economies of scale which can benefit domestic market production and prices, and wider international demand for Australian products. Yet this Government seems bent on killing the goose that laid the golden egg. This proves that the Government believes that success should be penalised rather than rewarded. Our current account deficit is increasing by $1,000m every month because we are importing more than we are exporting. Our foreign debt has increased by $10 billion from last year, to reach $115 billion by June this year. This is likely to increase if our dollar continues to appreciate, making imports more attractive and exports less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986-87 exports of manufactures and services grew by 26 per cent over the previous year but at the same time the cost of exporting increased. These higher costs mean that the increase of 9.5 per cent in export prices represents a real increase of only 4.5 per cent, and export growth in 1988-89 could well be adversely affected by a downturn in worldwide commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Various representatives of Australian business have expressed grave concern about the changes to the export market development grants scheme, as well they might. A group consisting of State chambers of manufacture and commerce as well as other smaller bodies made a submission last March to the Bureau of Industry Economics and to Austrade regarding the export market development grants scheme. This submission made a great many points on the current scheme, regarding its necessity and effectiveness, and it made some recommendations for its future. Most of these points and recommendations have been totally ignored by this Government. Nevertheless, I shall mention some of them because they are a reflection of what the exporters themselves feel export assistance should be about. They present some relevant and valid criticisms. The submission to the Bureau of Industry Economics and to Austrade begins with a list of reasons why Australian manufacturers need the export market development grants scheme. These can be summed up by the opening statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the EMDG scheme is seen as an incentive to manufacturers to enter and develop offshore markets for their companies and products. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission stresses that the export market development grants scheme is a financial and psychological motivation for firms to enter the high cost, high risk and low marginal return business environment of the international market place. It then reiterates that these disincentives are balanced by the benefits of growth and expansion of business, leading to higher employment, greater turnover and cash flow, and most importantly a reduction in our current account deficit. The second part of the submission highlights the effectiveness of the export market development grants scheme and includes some confidential case histories as illustrations. As the submission emphasises, apart from providing a counter to the more generous schemes provided to exporters by other countries, the export market development grants scheme provides a positive and crucial financial incentive to the long term export plans of Australian companies. Cutting back on the scheme now will badly damage our long range markets and international trading credibility, and could result in a drastic reduction in export returns. The submission emphasises the adverse effects of what were then only proposed changes-adverse effects which the Government has irresponsibly ignored despite this dire warning. This Government has also totally ignored the recommendation of this industry submission to maintain the export market development grants scheme in its present form until its expiry in 1990 and it has ignored the recommendation that a review board be convened as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In June, in my own State of South Australia, the South Australian Exporters Association, in conjunction with the Australian Manufacturers Council, made a last ditch stand to prevent the changes to the scheme and to make the parliamentary representatives of the people aware of the threat these changes pose to small businesses attempting to enter export markets. Yet the Government has also chosen to ignore these warnings. That is not all this Government has disdainfully ignored. It has also ignored its own protestations and promises. Since before the 1987 election the Prime Minister and his cohorts have been touting the necessity of maintaining the scheme intact. I have already quoted the former Minister in this regard, and on 16 June 1987 the Prime Minister said in a speech he presented:</PARA>
<PARA>Stability and certainty in the formulation and implementation of industry policies are crucial. Industry assistance policies must therefore be allowed to run their course. Export assistance programs are particularly valuable to small and medium sized businesses attempting to enter foreign markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Positive assistance measures such as export incentives . . . are investments in the long-term competitiveness of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Time and time again the Hawke Government and Austrade have reiterated that export assistance is vital to small and medium sized businesses entering export markets. The Chairman of Austrade, Mr Bill Ferris, said in a media release in May this year:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . both the Board of Austrade and the export community regarded the Grants scheme as very successful in that it provides cost effective incentives for Australian exporters, particularly the smaller and medium-sized manufacturing and service companies. </PARA>
<PARA>An Austrade survey conducted in February 1987 showed that smaller companies are the most successful exporters, as 95 per cent of the best performing exporters had an annual turnover of less than $5m. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, which is responsible for Austrade, stated, as announced in the May economic statement, that the export market development grants scheme aims to encourage small to medium sized Australian exporters to seek out and develop overseas markets, and that its objectives are to assist committed, newly emerging small to medium sized exporters in developing markets. But the changes announced in that economic statement will do exactly the opposite. Firstly, the total removal of New Zealand as an eligible market for expenditure will eliminate many of the new smaller exporters who often begin their move into the international marketplace in New Zealand. Also, the sudden announcement to remove this market as of 1 July 1988 will obviously cause financial hardship and disruption to market development plans and funding which has already been committed to the market for some time. Secondly, the proposal to raise the eligible expenditure threshold from $5,000 to $10,000 will prove to be an insurmountable barrier to many small businesses and will cause financial havoc with those firms which have based their costings on a certain level of export assistance returns. The scheme was due to run until 1990, and it should have been left untouched until that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The export earnings test is already severe enough and the proposal to tighten it up will only make things more difficult for exporters, especially in the early years. Austrade acknowledges that it takes three to four years to get an export market established, yet under the new rules only 20 per cent of export earnings will be eligible for grant payments. By the seventh year this will be down to 5 per cent. This will especially affect export sectors which already have difficulty meeting export earnings tests. I refer particularly to manufactures, construction services, computer software, high technology products, industrial property rights, and licensing and servicing companies in general. Many of these companies take many more years to generate export earnings than do commodity exporters, who can often generate large values of exports very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal will provide only minor cost savings but will create a major disruption to the scheme. It is not only the small exporters who will be adversely affected; larger and long established businesses will also be severely disadvantaged by the Government's decision to reduce maximum grant levels from $200,000 to $100,000 for those exporters who have received grants over nine years. It is taking away 50 per cent of the support and export promotional budget which frequently means the difference between Australian products being internationally competitive or non-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the changes in this legislation completely ignore inflation. The grant ceiling would need to be raised to $300,000 to restore it to its 1983 level. By cutting it to $100,000 the Government is cutting it by two-thirds in real terms. Similarly, the cut-off figure of $20m should be indexed. In June 1988 the Australian Manufacturers Export Council (AMEC) sent a letter to the Prime Minister in which all these points, and others, were raised. The Council expressed its members' disappointment at the significant alterations the Government was making to the export market development grants scheme. It is particularly concerned about the speed with which the decisions were taken after what it termed very hasty examinations and the very limited opportunity for public participation. AMEC made a very serious charge against the Prime Minister. In its letter it said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Manufacturers' Export Council considers the amendments proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill constitute fundamental changes to the scheme and as such are considered by the exporting community as a breach of the undertaking by both yourself and the Minister for Trade during the 1987 election campaign, that you would allow the scheme to run its full course. </PARA>
<PARA>This is indeed a very serious accusation and a very valid one in the light of the statements made by this Labor Government in the past 18 months. Even the Chairman of Austrade, Mr Bill Ferris, is on record as having said, on 26 May this year, that the Board of Austrade regretted that the Government had found it necessary to alter the eligibility criteria for the export market development grants scheme. AMEC concludes its letter by urging the Government to reconsider its decision for the benefit of Australian exporters and therefore, of course, for the benefit of the Australian economy and the Australian people as a whole. This Bill clearly indicates the Government's refusal to give that due reconsideration. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have it: a complete contradiction in terms, with the Hawke Labor Government yet again flying in the face of informed and concerned opinion. It is yet another of many examples of this Government saying one thing and doing another, just as it has done with the Industrial Relations Bill, which we recently debated in this chamber, and as it is now doing with its Budget forecasts. Last year this Government said that it would not alter the export market development grants scheme, yet less than 12 months later it has done just that, to the great detriment of the long term plans of Australia's exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that this country needs exports and that it wants to assist exporters in their efforts to build overseas markets. Yet in reality it does nothing to further this aim. It is all rhetoric. The Government is doing nothing to remedy the chronic situation of industrial relations on the waterfront, where labour rorts and outrageous work practices mean that high costs make Australian exports uncompetitive and frequent work stoppages make deliveries unreliable. Now the Government is trying to put one more nail in the coffin by cutting away at the funding designed to help Australian business sell its wares overseas in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that it is trying to cut costs, yet the figures show that despite a dramatic increase in assistance the export return on every dollar paid out has increased by $3 in one year from $38 to $41. Of course, this will have increased the profits of exporters and hence tax revenue. Cutting back expenditure at a cost of a diminishing export dollar return will reduce tax revenue, largely offsetting any expenditure saving. It would take only a small decline in the $6.9 billion in export earnings generated by these grants last year for the Government to lose revenue of $60m-roughly equivalent to the savings from these changes to the grants scheme. The changes will most likely ensure that decline, so the net effect on revenue will be nil. In other words, the savings the Government claims it will generate through the changes to this scheme will, in all likelihood, be more than offset by the fall in tax revenue as a result of the fall in export earnings from people who would otherwise have received the grant. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote Lindsay MacAlister, Managing Director of Austrade, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is essential for the balance of payments challenge and our economic prosperity that financial assistance for exporters is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr MacAlister reiterated that Austrade had to ensure the effectiveness of the export market development grants scheme as a support to exporters in the long term. How can it do this when the Government has continually undermined the scheme, first by abolishing the sustenance allowance and introducing the threshold and now by further cutting incentives, lowering the amount claimable by raising the threshold again, and wrecking the next few years budgets for exporters?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the changes to the scheme which prevent abuses of it, but we deplore those changes which impose unrealistic financial constraints, especially for smaller exporters starting out, who are faced with the high costs of penetrating foreign markets for the first time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support completely the remarks of my colleague Senator Chapman. I also support what the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney) said when he was leading the debate from this side of the House. I totally oppose the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1988, which comes at a time when our balance of trade deficit is at record levels, our dependence on overseas sales is absolutely vital, and when the Senate has just received a report from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am a member, which highlights the disastrous state of manufacturing industry in this country. I am absolutely at a loss to understand why this Government is now trying to hurt the small businesses that are attempting to earn some export income for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although this Bill may have a couple of good points, its intention will not help those who want to get into export industries. In the words of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), this Bill proposes to revise the export market development grants scheme. He used soft words such as `adjustments', `scope to improve' and similar words which hide the fact that this Government has decided that export promotion is not so vital. While the Government has made some improvements to the scheme, essentially this Bill results in many adverse aspects for industry, and that is what I am worried about. If ever there were an inappropriate time to cut back on export incentives, it would have to be now. Yet we have a government that did much for the export drive in the last Budget by knocking some 25 per cent off our export aid. This is a government that obviously has a closet mentality; it does not seem to realise that what we earn out of our own household is important. The Government is putting exports on the back burner and saying, `We will live within ourselves, we will not try to expand our exports'. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of payments figure for August showed a deficit of almost $1.4 billion. The month before the deficit was about $1.6 billion. We have just had another balance of payments deficit that was just under $1 billion, and in June this year our foreign debt was $115 billion-an increase of $10 billion on the year before. I cannot understand why we are not giving incentives to people who want to get out and sell more produce abroad. Our debt represents about $7,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. Our children and our grandchildren will be repaying this debt to other countries. We must have an export industry and we must have an incentive for that industry, yet that is being taken away by this Bill. We need those overseas markets; we need to increase our exports and reduce our imports. Yet here we have a government which discourages new and additional exports. That is not atypical of this Government; in fact it is quite typical because it has not always given a lot of help to Australia's industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to a press statement by the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, on 22 June 1987, when he was Minister for Trade. In Sydney he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have written to all recipients of EMDGS assuring them that the Hawke Government regards this scheme as an integral part of Australia's export effort . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I have also assured them-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the people in the export industries-</PARA>
<PARA>that we will not undermine that effort by chipping away at the spearhead of Australia's export drive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those are really shallow words when we realise that, just over a year later, the Government is chipping away at the export market development grants scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to give a couple of examples of how the scheme might have helped in the past and how it will now be in a lot of trouble. A colleague of mine in the other House, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), talked about the dried fruit industry. He said that the industry is not particularly large in Australia but its earnings of $100m last year added significantly to the Australian economy. Because of this Government's actions and its withdrawals of assistance this industry stands to lose over $200,000 in export assistance which will seriously hamper its export effort. This is only a small horticultural industry. It spends some $800,000 annually on promotion but it has to compete on world markets with countries such as the United States of America. Of course the United States Government gives some $10m annually to assist the United States raisin industry alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I had another example drawn to my attention of a veterinary products company established in Sydney that is adversely affected. It will be more adversely affected now. This company produces feed supplements and medications for the horse industry. Since its inception it has grown quite well and it now employs 12 people in Australia. Because of its success locally it decided four years ago to find markets elsewhere and it established trade contacts in the United Kingdom and Japan. It believes that, by 1992, given the progress and success of its products, 60 per cent of its turnover will come from offshore sales. This company is not a Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and it is never likely to be. It is basically a small group of people who found a niche in the market and who set about expanding that niche. With the previous export incentive grants available to it, it was able to make the move overseas. while the income it generates is only small, nevertheless it is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We recently had another great success story-the McGuigan family from the Wyndham Estate in the Hunter Valley. Everyone knows that the family won an export award, having used the export market development grants scheme to get off the ground and into a market. Fancy getting into a market such as France and selling wine to France! What a wonderful achievement. I would like to put on record in this place the wonderful achievement of that family in selling, not coal to Newcastle, but wine to France. The Wyndham Estate's wine is a wonderful wine anyway, but we all know that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other things that this legislation will do and see why it will knock some people out of the industry. The eligibility threshold will be raised from $5,000 to $10,000. The other day I was doing one of my numerous tours around country New South Wales and I visited a manufacturing industry. The principals in that manufacturing industry asked me how they would go about getting some assistance to try to sell their product in other parts of the world. They have already had orders from other parts of the world but they will now have to expend in excess of $10,000 to get going. They might not want to spend that $10,000 to get going; they might not even have it. Let us not forget that this has to be money up front. Some of the small companies now will not be able to afford to put $10,000 up front. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure in the Bill is the reduction in the maximum grants payable in successive years so that by year 10, the maximum grant will be $100,000. That will also affect other companies. In this country interest rates are rising, wages are increasing much too rapidly, our inflation rate is double that of our trading partners, and the Government talks a lot about the wonderful things that it will do for business. I say, `ha, ha, ha!'. What exactly has it achieved?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look at the labour market. Why do we not start getting a little productivity in the market? Senator McKiernan, who is one of our top trade union representatives from the west, was part of a committee that actually looked into the revitalisation of Australia's manufacturing industries. He has a lot to answer for in this place for what he has inflicted on the community in the western part of Australia. I hope that he will speak in this debate and say that. He did enough damage in his former capacity in making sure that we do not get exports. We cannot compete on world markets because we do not have a productive system in this country that allows us to do so. Something has to be done about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I finish-I know that Senator Macklin wants to get going before the suspension of the sitting for lunch-I would like to mention the amendment moved in this place by Senator Chaney. He said in paragraph (a) of that amendment:</PARA>

<PARA>I do not think anyone would disagree with that after the statement of Minister Dawkins only one year ago. The Government has misled Australian exporters-there is no doubt about it. Paragraph (b) of our amendment states:</PARA>

<PARA>How they do! They have already been itemised so I will not go through them again. Paragraph (c) of our amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as such, they are a breach of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Trade during the 1987 election campaign, that the scheme would be allowed to run its full course. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian people, the exporters of Australia, the people who want a decent income and standard of living in Australia, can ask this Government at the next election what it has done to make sure that this country is going along the right track so that it will be able to export and get into new markets. The people will show this Government at the ballot box that it has not done the right things by industry and by the people of Australia. They will decide at the ballot box in favour of the Opposition which has just highlighted and put on the record this Government's underhanded approach to the export market development grants scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill seeks to amend a scheme which has been operating since 1974. A series of changes has been made since that time. For some 14 or 15 years prior to 1974 an export market allowance scheme was operating. So this has been a long-standing method that Australian governments have used to assist our producers to export their products. Following the remarks that Senator Brownhill and other Opposition speakers have made, I hope that in the committee stage we will receive their support for the amendments that I shall move. Those amendments have been prompted by the exporters themselves. I shall expand on this in the committee stage, but I have attempted to meet at least two of the prime objections to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is a rationale behind assisting our producers to sell on overseas markets, it has to be based on the notion that they are confronted with an enormous range of problems which arise from the fact that this country is geographically isolated from most of its major markets. The problems include up-front costs, trading facilities, an understanding of local conditions and laws and logistic and commercial requirements. All these things combine to make it a fairly daunting task to get into the export business. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall the debate a couple of years ago on the setting up of Austrade, when I think there was general agreement that the activities of government in this area are vital and crucial to the success of the private sector's thrust into exports. The introduction of this Bill at this particular time is, I think, unfortunate. It was announced in the May mini statement that the scheme would operate from 1 July this year, when many of the exercises contained in the Bill are such that the longer term agreements that people have been making, the longer run of positions that people need to take and the planning that people need to put into these types of exercises are massively disturbed by the short time frame that has been suggested-in particular, the New Zealand one which I wish to address in the committee stage by way of my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major difficulty that we see is the way in which the support scheme is handled. I shall move amendments which seek to recast the exercise so that there will be a phase-in operation. I suppose it is very difficult for people outside to say that if a company has $20m-one of the figures used in the Bill-it needs that type of support. I have long been a supporter of the notion that if we are going to give any incentives it ought to be done on the basis of the results we get. I would have thought that a company that gets up to $20m exporting ought to be given incentives to go to $40m and $60m, rather than being told, `You have reached that level so we will cut out the support'. The obvious thing that will occur is that people will stay under the $20m. In other words, the scheme becomes a disincentive rather than an incentive to export. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I want to say only that I think it is most unfortunate that we are dealing with this matter in the context of the entire Bill when $400m has been provided by this Government for the promotion of alcoholism-basically that is what the deductions with regard to the sales tax on beer amount to-while in the same Budget all that we have about trade is a disincentive. I believe it is unfortunate that we have had this Bill and I look forward to Opposition support in the committee stage when I move the two amendments that have been suggested by exporters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity today to draw the attention of the Senate to the excellent work undertaken by Greening Australia. This association has worked tirelessly to make Australians more aware of the importance of vegetation and tree planting. I believe its tremendous efforts deserve acknowledgment and commendation. Recently it was my privilege to attend a function in Brisbane when Greening Australia and Men of the Trees arranged for a tree planting in Anzac Park at Toowong especially for our bicentenary year. Representatives from countries involved in World Expo 88 all came to plant a tree, and, of course, I believe that this will be a permanent reminder now that Expo is being dismantled in Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Greening Australia was established six years ago as the community arm of the national tree program and since then has been associated with the planting of millions of trees throughout Australia. It has established organisations in each State and has succeeded in coordinating financial resources with the efforts of community groups, individuals and government to establish a wide range of projects associated with the national tree program. </PARA>
<PARA> Greening Australia subscribes to the aims of the national conservation strategy for Australia. It believes that conservation and development are not incompatible-and that is a very important point indeed. Development is necessary to satisfy the demands of our increasing population, but unless it is guided by ecological, economic, social and cultural considerations it could have unde- sirable long term effects. Over the years, much of our native landscape has been cleared to make way for mining, industrial and urban development and for the agricultural and pastoral industries on which the economic strength of Australia depends. This loss of tree cover has accelerated soil erosion, increased salination, degraded water quality and reduced soil productivity. Essentially soil is a non-renewable resource. Topsoil lost to erosion will not be replaced naturally for thousands of years. Trees can help control erosion and are a renewable national resource. </PARA>
<PARA> Practical reafforestation and farm plans using trees and other vegetation can help promote improved land use management. The Fraser Government recognised the importance of tree decline and associated land degradation in 1982. It established the national tree program to encourage Australians to conserve, plant and regenerate vegetation for both community and private benefit. Fortunately, Australians have taken to the idea and the trend continues to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that conservationists not only need to talk about saving our rainforest and our trees; I believe they want to take action to plant trees, and this is what we have done around my home at Kingaroy. I look back to the time when my husband was quite young and we had an area of scrub behind our home at Kingaroy and he was all for cutting it down to grow some more corn. Fortunately, his father decided that the trees were more important than the money from the corn-one did not get too much money in those days anyway from selling corn-and so we kept the scrub, and that scrub, of course, has been added to by trees very regularly indeed. Our Kingaroy state school has a regular club day every year. One of its clubs is a tree planting club, and it is encouraging children to love trees and to grow trees. I think that, if all schools around Australia were to develop club days and have a tree planting club, this would be of very great benefit to Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> As a non-government organisation, Greening Australia enjoys a good measure of community support. It has benefited from support by large public corporations and by many small businesses at local level. This support supplements funding, advice and assistance provided by the Federal and State governments, but it is simply not enough. Greening Australia urgently needs further assistance if it is to succeed in carrying on its work in the twenty-first century. As a means of furthering public awareness of the problem of tree decline, Greening Australia established an annual award for outstanding achievement by an organisation, individual, authority or firm in furthering the greening of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, this award was made to the Lions Club of Bardon, in Brisbane, for its work with the Ithaca Creek project, which had its genesis in the establishment of a small children's playground but developed into the rehabilitation and regeneration of some 10 kilometres of creek line through Brisbane suburbs. It was an outstanding achievement and has attracted national and international attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, the award was made to Alcoa Australia Ltd. In support of greening during the International Year of the Tree in 1982, Alcoa undertook the development of an extensive community planting support scheme to encourage tree planting, particularly in rural areas where the need for trees is greatest. The scheme has been outstandingly successful and resulted in over 100 community tree groups being formed in Western Australia-and I am sure that Senator Knowles would be very interested indeed in that project there. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the award went to the Yass River Valley revegetation project in New South Wales, and it was my pleasure a couple of weeks ago to present this Australian award. The project has been operating since 1984. It has adopted a total catchment approach to ameliorating soil erosion and salinity problems in the Yass district. The project leader, Mr John Ive of Yass, attributed the success of the project so far to cooperation between the Government and an enthusiastic community willing to participate. The project has assisted in the production of comprehensive farm plans, the construction of a nursery capable of producing 25,000 tree seedlings per year, and has involved local schools in tree planting. It is good to know that the schools in the Yass district are being involved in tree growing. That is something, as I said earlier, that is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Annual field days have been hosted and a direct seeding machine purchased, the first of its kind used in the eastern part of Australia. The project has also been directly responsible for the propagation of 45,000 tree seedlings. It would not have been possible without the cooperation of a number of dedicated individuals and groups who care about our countryside. </PARA>
<PARA> The project provides an excellent model for others to follow as it demonstrates so clearly the benefits of cooperative community action. At the Queensland level I was very pleased to see the three groups were commended by the judging panel: the `Save the Trees' campaign research nursery at Zillmere, the Kern Corporation of Brisbane, and the Turner family of Milmerran. Mr and Mrs Turner were Queensland award winners last year for the extensive planting they have undertaken to protect their property and for their contribution to various field days. There is no doubt that right throughout Australia, if more farmers in rural areas were to plant areas of trees, that would help to alleviate the soil erosion problem immensely. I also begin to wonder whether perhaps if we planted more trees and really greened Australia, it would help us in our rural areas to get a little more rain more regularly. I do not know whether that has a proper connection, but I sometimes wonder whether the fact that we have cut down too many trees has caused the scarcity of rain, particularly in Queensland, or the fact that it does not rain as often as we would like. </PARA>
<PARA> Long before tree planting became popular, the `Save the Trees' campaign research nursery, based at Zillmere in Brisbane, was encouraging the conservation and use of trees. In the last 40 years it has sold and donated tens of thousands of trees and has provided advice and research into the conservation and horticultural usage of trees. </PARA>
<PARA> In undertaking an extensive streetscape project in Margaret Street, Brisbane, the Kern Corporation encouraged 19 other business premises to improve Brisbane's landscape through their `Brisbane Brush-up Campaign'. I guess that this could be an example, too, to other corporations and firms in other cities throughout Australia. Such projects do much to beautify a city, and I commend Greening Australia for its work in promoting public awareness of the importance of vegetation and tree-planting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was present at the handover by the Country Women's Association (CWA) of a sundial to the Parliament. I was there as a representative of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), but a number of members and senators were there, including my colleagues Senator Margaret Reid and Senator Bjelke-Petersen. Those who have not seen it should take a step out of their way to have a look at this most attractive piece of sculpture, which is a great credit to the artist and also to the organisation which has chosen that piece of sculpture to be presented to the national Parliament. It is very appropriate that an organisation like the CWA would present a sundial. The people in the country have their lives so ruled by the sun. Their crops and their livelihood are dependent upon it. They work by the sun, as we often hear when daylight saving matters are discussed. Their total lives, I think it is fair to say, are dominated by the sun.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are a lot more than lamingtons, Senator. They have made a major contribution to the lives of country communities, but they have done a lot more than that. They have certainly contributed as thinking individuals to the way this country is run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was particularly interested recently to be given a booklet in which the CWA listed some of the major recommendations which it had made to State and Federal governments over the years and it was an extraordinarily wide range of matters which its members had studied and in which they had decided to take a continuing interest. I commend them for the amount of work that goes into preparing material so that motions, such as those they have passed in the past, are able to be intelligently debated. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is one matter that intrigued me, and I find it curious that in all the many activities and areas of concern in the community that the CWA has studied, it appeared that it had given little or no attention to probably one of the most important matters that this country faces, and that is the defence of its citizens and its territory. I hope that the CWA will move to look at this direction. It seems to me that if anybody should be concerned to see that a country is properly defended, it should be the women of the country. Our history is littered with the lives of men and women ruined by war. After all, it is the women who send away their men, their lovers and their sons, to fight for our country, and all of us, hopefully, would expect and wish that this country will never again be required to do that. But it is my strong personal belief that there is no way that we will continue to achieve peace if we are not prepared to spend money in peace-time to see that war never comes. By that I mean that we need to have a credible deterrent in this country. We need to maintain good relationships with our neighbours-of course, it goes without saying-but we also need to be seen to be too strong to mess about with. I hope, therefore, that the CWA will look at this subject more seriously and in more depth in the future and take a very strong and continuing interest in something that is so vital to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw to the Senate's attention four motions which were passed by the CWA in Tasmania at its recent State conference. They are on four widely varying matters which affect the Federal Government. I would like to read them to the Senate so that they can be drawn more effectively to the attention of the Government. The first motion that affects the Federal scene was:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Country Women's Association in Tasmania (Inc) request the Federal Government to promote the National Greening of Australia to halt soil degradation by encouraging all citizens to plant a tree each year. </PARA>
<PARA>That was moved by the Riverside Branch. The second motion was:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Country Women's Association in Tasmania (Inc) urge the Federal Government to review all laws concerning property settlements after divorce. </PARA>
<PARA>That was moved by the Selbourne Branch. The third motion was:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Country Women's Association in Tasmania (Inc) urges the Federal Government to promote the culling of our Kangaroo herds by licensed shooters and the resultant meat and hides utilized for production of uniquely Australian produced goods. </PARA>
<PARA>That was moved by the Riverside Branch. The final motion which affects the Federal Government was directed to both State and Federal governments, and that was:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Country Women's Association in Tasmania (Inc) urges the State and Federal Government to consider the recycling of all used tyres for fuel production as part of an anti-litter campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>Once more, that was a motion from the Riverside Branch. </PARA>
<PARA> That gives an indication of the wide range of matters in which the Country Women's Association takes a very practical and detailed interest. I urge the Federal Government to look seriously at these resolutions, which come from citizens who are prepared to give a lot of their time to improve the lot of their communities, but who are also prepared intelligently to study issues which face the nation. I commend the members of the CWA for their long record of being concerned citizens working for the good of their country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was when I bought it. To continue, my information is restricted to what I have seen in newspapers, given that so far the Queensland Government has, as usual, been less than forthcoming in handing out details of legislation which it proposes, but I have had a number of queries in the office as to how it will affect our World Heritage areas in Queensland. Although I have some worries about that, I am sure that the Commonwealth can prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To answer the question, one major effect apparently will be the creation of a two-man board, Senator Boswell-just two. That will be the Conservator of Forests and the Under-Secretary of the Environment Department. Those two will have the power `to grant any person the right or privilege to do any specified thing in a recreation area . . .' I do not know whether that has been going on for 200 years, Senator Boswell, but I believe that most people in Australia would be appalled at the prospect of anything from logging to giant waterslides being permitted in our national parks. But in Queensland, under the regime that currently prevails, that is now apparently not only possible but almost certain. Obviously there has to be some concern when the National Parks and Wildlife Service is not even represented on the proposed board which is to decide what to do in Queensland national parks. The legislation is so bad that even the Queensland Liberal Party has decided to oppose it, and to get action from that party on anything is indeed wonderful.</PARA>
<PARA> I would remind honourable senators that there have already been instances where Cape Tribulation National Park was logged by a couple of Queensland Government cronies only a year ago, and it is only two or three years ago that the Queensland Government tried to sell Lindeman Island. I would have thought that somewhere along the line the Queensland Government might have learned something, but it raises serious doubts about Queensland's management of national parks. Importantly, though, after the first week of December when the World Heritage convention has accepted the inscription of the wet tropics area in north Queensland for the World Heritage List, it will be possible for the Commonwealth to ensure that the practice of giving away to cronies whatever the Queensland Government likes will not prevail in the wet tropics.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that the sacked ADC commissioners had moved to sell two ADC white elephants, namely the Oasis Hotel at Walgett and Nardoola, a property near Moree? Was evidence given to the Estimates Committee, at which Senator Tate was present, that amounts approaching $750,000 had been spent by the ADC on the Oasis Hotel which had been acquired by that body during the chairmanship of Mr Charles Perkins, that a decision had been taken in November 1987 by the ADC to sell the hotel, and that the new ADC decided in about June this year not to proceed with the disposal? Similarly, was evidence given to the Estimates Committee that Nardoola had been put up for sale by the old commissioners but withdrawn from sale by the new commissioners? In view of all this and Minister Hand's assertion that the new ADC was there to tighten up ADC decision-making, will the Minister explain to the Senate how these decisions represent any administrative tightening up?</PARA></TALK.START>

I forget the exact dates. As I recall the evidence on the Oasis Hotel, the ADC commissioners had put the disposal of the property in the hands of landbrokers and the evidence was that such offers as were made did not come in at the reserve price, so consideration needed to be given whether to pursue the question of disposal of the hotel. Obviously that was a factor to be taken into account by commissioners in relation to the disposal of the property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other factors which they are properly required to take into account to do with the social conditions of those who might be involved either as employees or as customers of that establishment.

<PARA>It may be that the letter formalises the conversations that were held with Mrs McPherson on the Minister's return to Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question has a remarkable similarity to a question that I should imagine would properly go to the Minister for Industrial Relations. The relationship to my portfolio is at best tenuous. Let me answer those parts of the question that are directly related to my portfolio. The Australian Government has encouraged and participated with the Western Australian Government in establishing the Western Australian Iron Ore Consultative Council. That is a body referred to in Senator Stone's question that has worked to harmonise the interests of unions, employers and the two governments in the iron ore industry. Since its inception in 1984 it has played an important role-not the only role, because there have been other factors at play as well-in setting a scene in which the level of industrial disputation in the Pilbara has fallen remarkably and the amount of productivity per worker has increased dramatically. I have to say as well that that is leaving aside the exercise that I know Senator Stone has some admiration for but I have disdain for at Robe River about 18 months to two years ago as a way in which proper industrial relations should be conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone asked me about BHP's efforts on restrictive work practices. I am aware that BHP, in the context of Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decisions on the 4 per cent, the second tier and so on, has engaged in discussions with its work force on productivity exchange and reached agreements on those matters. I am aware as well that there has been a positive view taken by Mount Newman in removing restrictive work practices, as there has been a positive view taken by the unions in the industry about restrictive managerial practices. But the proper place for those matters to be sorted out-and this is an element of one of the questions-is in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the body that has legal jurisdiction for handling industrial relations matters in that area. My understanding is that currently there is on foot in that Commission, before Commissioner Jack Gregor, proceedings to do exactly the things that the honourable senator asked.</PARA>

We say as a Federal Government that that is the right place to settle those types of disputes and we call upon the parties to use that facility to do exactly that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to put this in perspective. The Australian iron ore industry is meeting the challenge of firming and firmer world prices in iron ore. We expect exports for the 1988-89 period to reach an all time record. Perhaps 100 million tonnes of iron ore is achievable in the period 1988-89. As I have said, productivity in the industry is improving. Productivity in 1987 in terms of tonnes mined per employee increased 45 per cent over the 1983 level. Likewise, there has been a marked improvement in industrial relations since the Iron Ore Council to which I have referred was established and started operating.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the markets at risk factor, a question the honourable senator raised, I have had extensive discussions with the marketing managers of Mount Newman, as I have with the marketing managers of all the iron ore producers in the Pilbara, in order that we understand better the sensitivities of the market for the coming price negotiations in Japan. I have had discussions also with the general manager of Mount Newman, Mr Gordon Freeman, about the industrial relations situation and other problems. There is a recognition by Mount Newman that part of the reason it cannot meet the production quotas it set for itself as production goals is mine design and other engineering factors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been reports of the type referred to by Senator Foreman about the Federal Government's policy objectives for higher education, as outlined in the White Paper. They have been mostly inaccurate because all eligible institutions have applied to join the unified national system, although some which are subject to merger discussions have not applied as separate institutions. In doing so, the institutions have given reasonable commitments in important areas, such as management plans, staffing reforms, credit transfer policies, equity objectives and a common academic year. These objectives were all endorsed as important areas requiring reform during consultations on the Government's policy discussion paper which was released almost a year ago. The Government did not seek to tell institutions what they should do in these areas; rather, it asked the institutions to address the issues themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Institutions in the new system will now be able to share the substantial growth in student places-40,000 over the triennium commencing next year-and the substantial capital works program involving almost 100 new building projects over the triennium, as well as a major program of renovation of older buildings. There has been a problem in some areas because some academics want the additional resources without changing their work practices, as the rest of the work force is doing, in areas such as award restructuring. In particular, some want to preserve the system of lifetime academic tenure, regardless of whether the job exists. That question will be resolved by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rather than by the Government.</PARA>

Details of usage made by the Joint House Department of disposable wrappings and containers are being prepared and will be provided. I understand that, of all the products, only two-polystyrene cups and hamburger trays-were manufactured using a process involving CFC gases. Stocks of both of those items, when exhausted, will be replaced with products which do not contain CFCs. Due to a lack of storage space behind servery counters in the staff cafeteria, it has been necessary to use disposable plastic cups for soft drinks in lieu of glasses. A number of changes and modifications are required to Parliamentary Catering Service areas. These are being addressed progressively. As problems are resolved a greater use of reusable containers will be possible. I have asked the Joint House Department to further investigate the issues raised by Senator Vallentine and report back to me on whether additional measures to address her concerns are feasible.</PARA></TALK.START>

I certainly believe that that is the case, so that part of the article is accurate. In one sense it is ridiculous to suggest that a million people are at risk, especially when one is given the impression that they are all in Australia. That is certainly not an impression that I attempted to convey. Obviously the impact of higher temperatures and rising sea levels will be felt by many millions of people around the world. I did not estimate in the interview how many people would be at risk. I merely observed that this development had the potential to cause the death of who knows how many million people. That of course was on the assumption that nothing was done.</PARA>

<PARA> He asks me, `Why has a committee been formed?'. In my answer to that question, in dealing with his question forthrightly and honestly, I say that it has to be entirely separated from the premise of the first part of his question to have any logical debate about it. Having now separated it from the first part of the question, I add that the Labor Party is a party never afraid of going back and re-examining its policies and considering the premises on which they were based to see whether over time in the light of new or different information or experience those premises should be reviewed. The reason the National Conference of the Labor Party this year decided to set up a committee to examine that matter is that we believe it is important in this area of policy making to have a dynamic approach and to refine our attitude.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the last point of his question is concerned about market opportunity being lost, I refer him to an article in the Australian Financial Review this morning in which the writer deals with the subject of the possibility of new uranium contracts going to Japan from the United States because of the closing off of contracts from South Africa and Namibia. If the honourable senator reads that article, he will see that one of the prime questions reported is that there is a high level of political motivation, given the trade balance between Japan and the United States, as to why that is happening.</PARA>

I remind the honourable senator of the figures. Australia stands very high in the world pecking order in terms of government funded research and development. We stand up at the top of the ladder on that. But private sector research and development in Australia has been abysmal, and therefore our total research and development effort compares very badly with that of other countries. There is no secret that the Government has embarked on a quite deliberate strategy to encourage private sector investment in research and development and to encourage strong relationships between organisations like CSIRO and the private sector.

The brain drain from CSIRO identified in the article in question is a brain drain of one-a person who was the topic of questions in the Senate two or three weeks ago.

But it is important to note that when she talks about the CSIRO budget being slashed by 30 per cent she is not taking into account the fact that the total CSIRO budget next year will be the biggest it has ever been in the history of the organisation. It is just that some people do not like the source of some of the money when they have been relying for donkey's years on the everlasting arms of government to sustain them and keep them in good stead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen several reports concerning the financial status of the Trade Practices Commission in so far as it relies on funding from the Commonwealth Government. The underlying assumption of the question, that there has been some sort of dramatic decline in funding, is one that has been put forward in the press over recent weeks but I think it needs to be clarified both for Senator Powell, in particular, and for the Senate generally. In fact the Trade Practices Commission's funding has not been treated any differently from other areas of the portfolio, and it has faced no particular subjection of very stringent reductions in its expenditure when we look across the whole portfolio. In money terms there was a small increase, though admittedly a small decrease in real terms, between 1987-88 and 1988-89, from $7.888m to $7.942m. I think that puts the matter in perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major reduction in funds appears under the restricted trade practices compliance program, but that is due to an abnormality in that it includes $1.019m which was the final part of the special funding provided to the TPC in the last two financial years to cover an order for legal costs against the TPC when it lost the long running Tradestock case. These costs have all been paid, so no special funding is needed this year. Thus, although sometimes the impression is given that there has been a reduction of something like $1m between the funding available to the TPC this year compared with last year, it really depends on that abnormal payment made in relation to the Tradestock case. In fact there has not been that severe pruning of funds available to the Commission that might otherwise be assumed and indicated. As to any future increase or decrease in funding, the Commission's funding is subject to normal budgetary discussions, and they will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</PARA>

General practitioners have consistently shown themselves to be fair, caring and responsible people and to be enthusiastic participants in Medicare. According to most recent statistics, only 3 per cent of GPs' standard consultations have been charged according to the AMA's recommended fee levels. GPs are showing that they are not prepared to inflict financial hardship on their patients in order to increase their own incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the Government is prepared to respond to the responsible attitude of GPs by showing our willingness to work with any medical organisation that is prepared to adopt a cooperative rather than a confrontationist approach to resolving the concerns of GPs. The Government is happy to discuss constructively changes to the Medicare benefits schedule, the overriding purpose of which is to improve the standard of patient care. I am hopeful that such genuine consultation might be the outcome of meetings between doctors groups and the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, later this week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave a preliminary response to Senator Lewis on a question about sponsorship or, more accurately, the sponsorship `crawl' which is broadcast in association with the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) test pattern. I am now in a position to give some further information. I am advised that the SBS has received money for at least two of the sponsorship `crawl' exercises in February and April of this year. Section 79za of the Broadcasting Act provides that the SBS may receive money from program sponsorship of a kind approved by the Minister. I can now confirm what I indicated was my recollection yesterday. I did not give any such approval for this particular exercise and the present Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, advises me that neither has he since he took up the portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The SBS has advised the Minister that it received advice from its corporate solicitor that ministerial approval was not required as the announcements were shown only as part of its test pattern rather than in the context of its programs. However, the recent publicity-not just the question yesterday but other publicity before that-prompted the SBS to ask that this advice be reviewed. As a result the SBS wrote to Mr Willis on 26 October seeking his approval for the announcements. Mr Willis tells me that he will respond to the SBS as soon as he is satisfied that the `crawl' messages are in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act. In the meantime, the sponsorship messages have been discontinued.</PARA>

<PARA>As I made clear yesterday and as the written document makes clear, the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was unanimous.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction to the Independent Air Fares Committee report states that one of its main tasks was to monitor the developments in domestic air fare market and ensure that the current economy air fare determinations continued to be appropriate for the period from 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988. The introduction to the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the Committee will continue to approve economy fares which reflect costs efficiently and economically incurred in the operation of passenger services, and to give active support to discount fare initiatives aimed at stimulating the demand for domestic air travel. </PARA>
<PARA> The two major airlines in Australia, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines, have a combined market share of 87.6 per cent of the domestic traffic. This is significant because the fares that they charge have a considerable effect on influencing other airlines. These two airlines have the greatest capacity and range of aircraft in the domestic airline industry. One aspect of this is that there appears to be a case of feather- bedding occurring in this industry in relation to manning levels on the larger aircraft operated by both airlines. Australia is the only place in the world where this overmanning-a crew of three pilots-occurs in the larger aircraft. There appears to be a blatant overmanning level compared with that applying in other countries where stringent air safety rules also have to be satisfied. In those other countries these planes are operated with lower crew levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no indication in the report of how the fares are determined on the routes that use these particular aircraft. I wonder whether the high staffing costs are taken into account. I would recommend that where these adverse work practices apply, the extra manning costs should be excised in determining the level of fares, thus benefiting the air travelling public. Given the previously mentioned task of the Committee, it is important that these costs should be excised when determining flight costs in order to ensure the lowest possible cost to consumers in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is intended to give legislative effect to the Government's decisions on the issues arising out of the Australian Law Reform Commission report on lands acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA> The present law governing Commonwealth acquisition, the Lands Acquisition Act, was enacted in 1955. However, many of the provisions it contains are a carryover from the original legislation passed in 1906. In turn that was based on an 1845 United Kingdom statute. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1977 the then Federal Attorney-General requested that the Law Reform Commission examine the Commonwealth legislation. The terms of reference for the Commission specifically concentrated on the rights afforded to persons whose land was acquired by compulsory process by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Commission was tabled in the parliament in April 1980. The Commission was critical of a number of aspects of the Lands Acquisition Act. During recent years the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted legislation to enable the independent review of administrative decisions which adversely affect individuals. The decision to acquire property, particularly by the use of the compulsory process, is a decision which affects, sometimes profoundly, the owner of the property. There is no mechanism within the current Act whereby an owner may require the acquiring authority to justify publicly the need for and choice of his property. When persons' homes are acquired it can cause significant disruption to the individuals involved. There is no legislative provision to ensure that displaced owners can provide for themselves out of their compensation money a suitable alternative home. It seems reasonable that people in those circumstances should be provided practical assistance and recompense for the intangible effects of removal from their home. This is not provided in a legislative sense in the current Act. Another problem not covered by the Act is that of blight. It is not uncommon for a government's acquisition decisions to be generally known some years before an acquisition may take place. Someone whose property is involved can find themselves in the situation where there is no market for their property because of the Government's intentions and the Government might not be ready to acquire the land for some years. Under the current Act there is no facility for the owner to compel the Government proposing the acquisition to purchase from him. Inflation can also cause difficulties for owners, particularly if there is a significant lapse of time between acquisition of the property and payment of compensation following final agreement on the amount to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other deficiencies with the Lands Acquisition Act were identified by the Law Reform Commission in its report which contained a series of recommendations with three main objectives: more open procedures in the acquisition process; greater public accountability for decisions to acquire property; and more generous statutory provisions for compensation for persons deprived of their land by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Law Reform Commission report an inter-departmental working party comprising representatives of the major policy departments concerned was set up to review the report and develop recommendations for government consideration. In 1983 the Government agreed to the implementation of most of the Commission's recommendations to be incorporated into new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents the fulfilment of the Government's decision. It is obvious that it has taken some years to get to the stage of being able to present this Bill to parliament. Whilst that is regretted it is this Government's intention that priority should be given now to seeing this Bill enacted and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives at the end of the autumn session, the Government indicated that debate on the Bill would not occur for some months to allow sufficient time for interested parties to examine it in detail and provide comment on it. The Government is pleased that a number of organisations took up the invitation and literally dozens of comments on different parts of the Bill have been submitted. </PARA>
<PARA> Submissions were made by a number of groups, including the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Administrators, the National Farmers Federation, Northern Territory and Western Australian chambers of mining, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the Land Acquisition Reform Committee. The latter group convened a two-day symposium in Sydney to discuss the Bill which was attended by the Opposition, the judiciary and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At that forum the Government emphasised the promise that it would consider all comments made and incorporate any suggestions for amendment which were considered would contribute to the general intentions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered all the comments and during the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives 34 amendments which reflect the suggestions and comments generated by the consultation process were incorporated into the Bill. Some of those amendments were of a technical nature but others were made because they contributed to the objectives of this major legislative change which clearly has the interests of individuals as its primary focus. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to specific provisions of the Bill. There are numerous provisions which are being written into this Bill which are not contained in the current legislation. Time does not permit me to highlight all of those issues. However there are a number of matters which should be brought particularly to honourable senators' attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would first like to make clear that this legislation relates to the acquisition by the Commonwealth of any interest in land. In clause 6 the definition of an interest in land for the purposes of this Bill is as wide and all embracing as it can be. In comments to the Government there has been some concern expressed that the definition might not include mining tenements. The concern is that the Commonwealth might through its actions extinguish some right to the use of land conferred by a mining tenement and not compensate the owner of the tenement. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the case. Tenements are interests in land and if they are acquired by the Commonwealth then the Constitution requires that the owner be justly compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifies an entirely new and comprehensive process that must be followed when the Commonwealth wishes to acquire property. At the start of the process the Bill at clause 22 requires the Government to make a pre-acquisition declaration. This declaration is a statement of intention which is provided to the owner identifying the land the Commonwealth wishes to acquire and giving the Government's reason for the acquisition. Clause 23 says that at the same time the Government's intention to acquire is to be made public by publication in the Gazette and a local newspaper. Furthermore the Bill requires that the market place be alerted to the Commonwealth's intentions by providing at clause 38 that the declaration be lodged with the registrar of titles and by clause 39 the owner will be required to tell intended purchasers of the Commonwealth's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places numerous requirements on the Government to complete acquisitions expeditiously. Throughout the Bill time limits are identified in which the Commonwealth must act or make decisions. One example of this is at clause 44 which says that where an owner has been served a pre-acquisition declaration he can in writing agree to the acquisition and require the Commonwealth to acquire his property within three months. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the particularly significant provisions of the Bill is that an owner can seek a review of the Government's decision to acquire their property. Clause 26 of the Bill stipulates that the owner can formally seek that the Minister reconsider his decision to acquire. Following that, if the Minister reaffirms the decision to acquire, clauses 28 and 29 provide that the owner is able to seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the Minister's decision. The Bill provides at clause 29 and 30 that the Tribunal will hear the appeal and recommend to the Minister a course of action. Clause 31 lists the range of issues that are to be relevant to any review by the Tribunal. However the review should not include environmental matters where an inquiry has been held under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. It is intended by clause 31 that any such review would encompass: the nature of the public purpose; the extent to which the public purpose is in the public interest; the suitability of the land for the public purpose; the effect of the acquisition on the land owners; the environmental effect of the use and development of the land; and any other means of achieving the public purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> However clause 22 says that the policy decision of government which has led to the acquisition should not be subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is concerned by the need to strike a balance between the rights of private property on the one hand and the legitimate needs of society for land for public purposes on the other. It is also concerned at the effects on efficient administration of legislation relating to acquisitions of land and the speedy resolution of claims for compensation. For these reasons the Bill specifies instances where a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is considered inappropriate and should not be allowed. However, such circumstances are clearly defined and constrained and include for instance at clause 24 where the Minister is prepared to certify that the review should not be held due to urgency or where the issue of a pre acquisition declaration could be prejudicial to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one part of the Bill that the Government amended in response to comments made during the consultative process that was adopted. Initially the Bill at clause 24 contained a third situation where there would be no pre acquisition declaration and no right of appeal to either the Minister or the AAT for review of the decision to acquire and that was where the Minister certified that it was essential that particular land be acquired. That provision was initially suggested to government by the Administrative Review Council. The notion was that since the Minister was not to be bound by a recommendation of the AAT on the decision to acquire, if the Minister initially certified a definite intention to acquire due to the essential nature of the acquisition, then review of the decision by the AAT would be redundant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has acknowledged the concern that has been expressed at this provision by deleting it from clause 24. However the Government has retained a similar provision in clause 22 but in that instance a pre acquisition declaration would be issued and made public and the owners could seek that the Minister reconsider his decision. So although appeal to the AAT would not be available use of the provision would be quite public. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore if an owner of land being acquired using this provision believed that the provision was being misused he would be able to appeal to the Federal Court under the Provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also not intended that review processes would apply in situations described in clause 40 where the acquisition is of the nature of a normal commercial transaction between parties dealing with one another on an equal basis and by inference from which any party is able to withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is concerned at the effect on owners of some of the Government's activities which might be undertaken leading up to a decision to acquire a property. Consequently whilst the Bill retains the present powers of temporary entry to enable the Commonwealth to enter onto land to investigate its suitability, there are at clauses 9, 13 and 95 added requirements over the present legislation for the Commonwealth to: give 7 days notice of the proposed entry; minimise damage to the land; compensate for any expenses incurred by the land owner; as a consequence of the temporary occupation in addition to any damage or loss suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, where a pre-acquisition declaration has been issued to an owner and the acquisition does not eventually proceed, clause 96 of the Bill provides for the owner to claim and be paid compensation for any loss suffered as a result of the Commonwealth's activities. Where an owner claims compensation as a result of the Commonwealth's temporary entry, occupation and/or abandonment of an acquisition, initiative rests with the claimant. There is to be a new requirement at clause 96 limiting the claim period to three years. The Bill requires at clause 103 that once the claim is lodged the Commonwealth is to decide within 2 months on whether the claim will be accepted and what compensation will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the new provisions which have been written into this legislation relate to the process involved where a compulsory acquisition takes place and compensation is to be paid. Under clause 41 of the Bill compulsory acquisitions are to be authorised by the Minister rather than by the Governor-General as is the current requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Act provides only limited guidance for the determination of the question of compensation although practices in use have been developed in line with case law over the years. This Bill adopts in clauses 54 to 63 a detailed statutory list to provide guidance to all parties and the Federal Court as to the basis of compensation. The Bill retains the existing provision that compensation should be based on a market value of the land which includes by judicial interpretation any special value to the owner. However, the Bill provides that the compensation entitlements will be expanded to provide for: disturbance including loss or damage incurred as a reasonable consequence of the acquisition. Clause 55 says that such costs should at all times be reasonable having regard to market rates and should also be directly related to the acquisition; clause 59 says that compensation is to be assessed on the basis that any zoning restrictions for a public use are to be ignored provided that a claimant who bought the property in the knowledge of any restriction would not be entitled to compensation on a `without restriction' basis; where a person's principal place of residence is acquired clause 61 stipulates that there will be provision for a householder's solatium to compensate for the intangible and unquantifiable losses suffered by the owner. A fixed statutory payment of $10,000 is to be provided and that amount will be increased annually in line with the consumer price index; where a person's principal place of residence is acquired and the compensation payable (including compensation for disturbance but excluding any solatium payment) is insufficient to acquire replacement housing clause 61 says that compensation is to be increased to enable the acquisition of a reasonable equivalent; clause 58 says that optional compensation shall be paid on the basis of cost of the equivalent reinstatement where land is used for a purpose for which there is no general demand or market and use will continue on other land, e.g. schools and churches; clause 55 provides that the reasonable expectation of an owner of any renewal of leases or licences etc. if the acquisition had not occurred will also be included in the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides at clause 60 that any increase or decrease in the value of a property due to the proposed work by the Commonwealth is to be disregarded in assessing compensation. Additionally new provisions will clarify in clause 60 that: where a site can only be developed by a government body the special suitability of that site is to be disregarded in compensation; any increase in the value of the property due to unlawful use is to be disregarded, and any increase in value due to improvements carried out without the Minister's approval after service of a declaration is to be disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the present system should be retained whereby properties acquired using the compulsory process are acquired by publication of a notice in the Gazette of the acquisition. However, in order to facilitate claims by interested persons the Bill requires at clause 41 that a notice should also be published in a local newspaper indicating that the acquisition has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill clearly indicates the procedure that must apply whereby the owner can claim compensation. Once the property has been acquired the Bill requires in clause 48 that the Commonwealth will notify the former owner of the acquisition and advise him that he appears to be entitled to compensation. In clause 67 the owner is requested to prepare a claim on an approved form for submission to the Commonwealth. After the Commonwealth receives the claim from the former owner the Commonwealth then has a limited period of 42 days in which to make an offer to the former owner and disclose the basis of the calculation of the offer. Clause 75 says that the claimant may then respond either accepting the Commonwealth's offer or submitting full details of the basis on which his claim is calculated. Once the owner has made his revised claim clause 76 says that the Minister must make a final offer within 2 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the owner and the Commonwealth cannot reach agreement on the amount of compensation that needs to be paid the Bill provides for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the Minister's decision on the amount of compensation. These provisions apply not only in clause 81 to compensation following compulsory acquisition but also in clause 107 in relation to compensation for temporary entry and occupation of land and abandonment of acquisition proposals. The Bill provides in clauses 81 and 107 that both parties would be bound by the Tribunal's decision on how much compensation should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that in this Bill in clause 131 in cases where an owner applies to the Tribunal for review of a decision to acquire or a reasonable application to review the quantum of compensation, the Tribunal is able to recommend to the Attorney-General that the costs of the appeal should be met by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that negotiations on the amount of compensation to be paid and ultimate review of the quantum of compensation by the Tribunal may take some time. The Bill contains provisions which are aimed at minimising the difficulties faced by an owner. For example the Bill contains at clause 47 a provision whereby the owner is allowed to remain in occupation for 6 months where the Commonwealth has no immediate need of the property either on agreed terms or on terms decided by the Minister. Furthermore clauses 85 and 110 of the Bill provide that where the Minister has accepted a claim and made an offer of compensation but the offer is not accepted by the claimant the Commonwealth shall make an immediate payment of 90% of the Commonwealth's offer. When agreement is reached on the amount of compensation to be paid, clauses 91, 92 and 115 provide that interest will be paid on the balance of the amount compounded at 3 monthly rests from the time of the acquisition or in relation to clause 115 from the time the claimant lodged the claim. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters covered and provided for within this Bill. One which is of particular significance relates to the acquisition of land in public parks. </PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation does not allow the Commonwealth to acquire land which is in a public park. The Australian Law Reform Commission accepted that this was an unreasonable constraint particularly in instances where an intended acquisition may not be controversial but may nevertheless be necessary for the Government's purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not uncommon for the Government to need a facility such as a navigation beacon or a communications tower in a location within a park. At the present to acquire such a property, no matter how small, the State government has to excise the land in question from the park to enable the Commonwealth to acquire the land. However, whilst recognising that the Commonwealth should be able to acquire land in public parks it is also essential that safeguards be provided within the legislation to ensure that this power is used properly. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason in clause 42 the Bill requires that where the Commonwealth wishes to acquire land in a public park the following conditions must be met. Firstly, the relevant State must agree to the acquisition. Secondly, there must be a full inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 except that both Houses of Parliament may veto the need for a full inquiry. Where that happens the requirements of the Environment Protection Act must still be met with a further stipulation that where the property to be acquired is part of a world heritage property or a property on the national estate then a full environmental impact statement must be prepared. Finally, once the acquisition has occurred clause 46 provides that either House of parliament will have a veto power whereby the acquisition can be made null and void. </PARA>
<PARA> This process will enable non-controversial acquisitions by the Commonwealth of land in public parks to be achieved expeditiously whilst at the same time sufficient safeguards are provided to ensure that those acquisition powers are not abused. The process provides protection of the States' rights and ensures that environmental and heritage issues are adequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 124 of the Bill provides for regulations to be made to prescribe the conditions for exploration and mining on Commonwealth land. The Government's policy for access to Commonwealth land for exploration and mining does not apply to national parks or Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Lands Acquisition Act allows for mining and exploration on Commonwealth land to be controlled by the State using State legislation but subject to any conditions the Commonwealth may wish to apply. However, access to Commonwealth land for mineral exploration and development has been constrained by the lack of a co-ordinated policy and the lack of clearly defined administrative procedures. It is not clear to mining companies what the Commonwealth requirements might be and it is considered that this lack of communication discourages mining companies from pursuing mining activities on Commonwealth land. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers there is scope to implement a multiple land use policy through developing procedures which could allow exploration and mining on Commonwealth land, subject to conditions which protect the Commonwealth's interests in the land such as environmental, heritage and socio-economic factors as well as its specific use of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted a set of policy principles which it believes should apply in order that a multiple land use policy may be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA> Mineral exploration and development on Commonwealth land will be allowed to proceed where these activities do not preclude the purpose for which the land is designated, and where they comply with all relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory laws and policies. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Commonwealth proposes to acquire land or change the use of an existing area of land, the resource potential of the area will be taken into account as part of the Commonwealth's general assessment of the area's suitability for the proposed use. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will acquire mineral rights only where the principal purpose for acquisition precludes mineral development. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commonwealth disposes of land on which it holds the mineral rights, the Commonwealth will normally dispose of the mineral rights to the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the making of regulations prescribing the conditions for exploration and mining on Commonwealth land. The regulations may also make provision for the making of arrangements between the Commonwealth and a State or Territory for the officers of a State or Territory to administer the granting of mineral exploration and mining licences over Commonwealth land. It is envisaged that the regulations made under the Bill will contain provisions similar to those of relevant State or Territory mining laws. However for the first time mining companies will know what the Commonwealth's requirements are regarding access to Commonwealth land for mining purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> All proposals to explore or mine on Commonwealth land administered under the Lands Acquisition Act will be examined for the effect they will have on the environment in accordance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, where applicable. Also, all proposals must be approved by the Federal Minister responsible for the Lands Acquisition Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This changed approach by the Commonwealth to mining and exploration on Commonwealth land has caused some concern amongst the mining industry. However the Government is convinced that the mining industry will find the new approach to be a great improvement over the present ad hoc approach. That will become apparent when the mining regulations are provided for parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, this new legislation is not going to be held back from commencement by a need for those mining regulations to be drafted. It is the Government's intention that the new Act should commence as soon as possible. The Bill provides in subclause 124 (8) that until such time as the mining regulations are available and take effect the arrangements under the current Act will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I have identified here what the Government believes to be the main provisions in the new legislation which depart from the requirements of the current legislation. The Government believes that the Commonwealth needs to update its approach to the acquisition of land and in particular to protect the concerns and interests of the property owners whose property is acquired by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill achieves all this. It provides a balance between the protection of the rights of individuals and the ability for the Government to meet its property needs. It offers to property owners the ability to question the Government's decision to acquire their property. It clearly specifies the wide range of factors to be taken into account in assessing compensation. At the same time it also provides an efficient process that the Government can use when it is dealing in a normal commercial market situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-When the Senate passed the motion establishing the legislative and general purpose standing committees on 22 September last year, several matters which had been referred to the former Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, and which had not been disposed of before the dissolution of the Thirty-Fourth Parliament, were referred to the new Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I presented a report on three of those references on 19 November last year. One remaining reference was the Australian Army's rapid deployment capability, given to the Committee on 26 March 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our predecessor Committee held an in-camera hearing on the reference, and undertook several inspections in connection with it during 1985. Since that time, the Government has received the report of the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, by Mr Paul Dibb in March 1986, and the Government in turn presented a White Paper, entitled The Defence of Australia, in March 1987. Both reports deal with the Australian Army's rapid deployment capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has taken note of these reports and in view of the other commitments that are currently before it, in particular, finalising an inquiry into contingency planning, for nuclear-armed and/or powered warship visits, and a new inquiry which it has just begun into Australia-India relations, it has decided to take no further action on the matter referred to its predecessor Committee in March 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to make a couple of comments about this paper. Although it has been on the Notice Paper for some time, it was a very long time in coming to the Senate. The figures that are given in this report are current only to 30 June last year which makes it a very old document indeed before that information is available to the Parliament. I think that is quite unacceptable. Certainly, it is not new for us to find that the reporting of VIP flights has taken so long to come before the Parliament. In studies that I have made of the subject, members of the current Government were complaining about something similar years ago. It may simply be a case of a lot of paper work to be got ready with not a great deal of priority in the Department of Defence. Nevertheless, the Parliament should not be given material which is so old that it is almost useless, especially when we consider that we are talking about the expenditure of at least $6m in any one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that the Government has plans to change the VIP fleet this year into a leasing arrangement. I find that an acceptable option. However, I am concerned at a couple of matters which came to my notice when looking at this paper. One is what I believe to be the excessive use by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of the VIP fleet. It would appear to anybody reading this report that the Treasurer uses this fleet virtually as his private taxi, particularly between Sydney and Canberra. But I question whether the guidelines which have been laid down now for many years are being observed as strictly by this Government as they have been by previous governments. There have been questions and answers on the subject of the guidelines in this Parliament for a number of years. I draw to the attention of the Senate a question that Senator Walsh asked on notice of the then Minister for Defence on 5 May 1981. He got a detailed answer from Senator Durack about the guidelines laid down for the use of these aircraft. I would very much like to know whether there has been a change of those guidelines since 1981. If there has not, I suspect, from any fair reading of the paper, that they are being observed in the breach rather than to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to draw attention to the fact that, during the last election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) saw fit to use the National President of the Returned Services League (RSL), Sir William Keys, on an election tour to far north Queensland during which he gave interviews on the respective merits of the Government's policies and the Opposition's policies. I find that a most unacceptable use of the VIP fleet. I conveyed my feelings on this matter to Sir William Keys at the time but I now question publicly the Government's use of the aircraft in facilitating heads of lobby groups-which, of course, the RSL is, and a very effective one too-to take part in an election campaign for the Government's benefit. I am quite sure that that cannot be within the terms of the guidelines and the Government stands condemned for using the aircraft in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly would like to see these records coming before the Parliament much more speedily and I would like details of the costs of each flight. I know that they have been asked for before, but they still have not been provided. The excuse has always been that it is a difficult matter. I do not accept that as being a satisfactory answer because these days, with computerisation throughout the Defence Force, and the fact that those costs have to be calculated for budgetary purposes, I do not believe that it is beyond the ability of the Government to provide that information to the Parliament when it is providing the details of the flights. I hope that that will be improved upon in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Council on Overseas Professional Qualifications (COPQ) was established in June 1984 following the Government's acceptance of the recommendations of the report of the Fry Committee of Inquiry into the Recognition of Overseas Qualifications in Australia. The aim of this Council, which replaced the previous Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications, was to develop and improve procedures for assessing overseas professional, technical and general academic qualifications. The council was also given the responsibility to follow up the Fry report recommendations, other than the findings of Fry relating to recognition procedures in the trades area. As this report also is late appearing. It is sad that it has taken a while for us to read that during the year 1986-87 the council made a review of progress as far as the Fry report recommendations are concerned and concluded that there was a need to reassess priorities and directions for further development of the Council's operations. The Council decided to embody its findings in a four-year plan, 1987 to 1991, to maintain the thrust of the Fry report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that the Senate appreciate the goals of the Council. The Council set its priority tasks as the amendment of the Migration Act to define the Minister's powers in relation to overseas qualifications, and of course one of the findings of the recently published report of the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies is that the Migration Act itself should be amended. Another priority is the further development of non-discriminatory recognition and assessment procedures and the provision of improved information and advice on qualifications for prospective immigrants overseas. One of the functions of the Council is to conduct examinations for people holding qualifications that are not immediately acceptable to registration and recognition authorities. In fact, during this year the assessment by examinations was carried out in the areas of dentistry, dietetics, engineering, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry and veterinary science. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the achievements of the Council that I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate is its establishment of pilot bridging courses for overseas qualified professionals. It was recognised some time ago that a bridging program was very necessary if people were to have their qualifications recognised in this country. Some interesting figures are included in the report, but I only have time to draw the attention of the Senate to a few of them. In 1986-87 the largest number of non-approved qualifications in computing came from countries listed on page 20 of the report. Of that number the highest proportion was 83.3 per cent of applicants from Sri Lanka and the lowest proportion cited in this group was 34.6 per cent from Hong Kong. It is interesting that of those who applied to have their computing qualifications registered, 37.8 per cent of those from the United Kingdom were not recognised and 50 per cent of those from the United States of America were not recognised. Those figures are revealing and I suggest that there should be further investigation into that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to note who are the clients of COPQ. Of the 113,000 people who received visas to enter Australia during the 1986-87 year, about 20,000 were identified as having professional, sub-professional, technical or trade skills, but half of COPQ's clients are already resident in Australia. Those people are migrants who were not selected on the basis of their skills or qualifications, but have arrived as family members, refugees or under special humanitarian provisions. The rest of COPQ's clients are prospective migrants and those requests are referred to COPQ through overseas posts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be advisable and appropriate to deal with this particular paper today, concerning medical research. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is meeting today and tomorrow and reports have come out that a great deal of concern is being expressed about the amount of funds available for medical research in Australia. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), according to the news media, was confronted with some anger at cuts in money for the Commonwealth funded NHMRC. I think it is appropriate that we look at the situation and set down some facts. In 1988 there were 952 applications for project grant support, of which 304 were funded. A further 289 received the scientific rating, which placed them in a `highly recommended funding' category, but they could not be provided with support from the available funds. In other words, there were almost 300 applications which passed all the tests and presumably all the assessors' reports but which could not be funded. The reason given was that funds were not available, but that is only one of the reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The NHMRC should have a look at where it is sending its funds. I have raised this matter in this chamber before. Over a period of six years an amount of $450,000 in NHMRC grants was applied to a project which dealt with the dioethical issues in the use of foetal tissue and human gametes and embryos. I have mentioned before in this chamber the concern that is fairly broadly expressed that these amounts largely have gone to Professor Singer and Dr Cusa. Professor Singer, of course, has often published his view that the human embryo, the human foetus and indeed the newborn child have no inherent right to exist and specifically that a human embryo is of no more inherent worth than a lettuce. I think it is also of concern to those scientists who have not been able to receive funding although their projects have been regarded as being worth while. It is also interesting to note that very substantial amounts of funding have been given in this area, in what essentially is not an area of medical research. It is being applied in a polemical debate to prevent legislation being introduced and supported to cover these most important issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an annual report for the year 1986-87 and is therefore already somewhat out of date. The report notes that the future for Christmas Island and Christmas Islanders is uncertain. There was an unexpected and rapid winding down of the phosphate mining company, but after that many unemployed people stayed on the island in expectation of tourism development. To date there has been virtually no such development. In fact, all that we have had introduced into this place is an ordinance for a casino to be built on Christmas Island. There are varied views on this, and no doubt the matter will be debated fully at a later time. I am sure that everyone is in agreement that the fragility of the environment of Christmas Island must be taken into consideration, whatever its future is to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is to be regretted, and it is mentioned in the report on page 54, is that the democratically elected Christmas Island Assembly was dissolved on 28 October 1987. Although the island and its population are small, it had a very successful form of self-government. It had an Assembly of nine members, elected by proportional representation under a Senate-style electoral system. If honourable senators care to look at page 32 of the report, they will see that the names of the nine Assembly members reflect the multicultural aspect of that community. When it existed, the Assembly was very responsible, and this was reflected in its actions. It was certainly concerned with the long term good of the island and its environment. For example, I cite the recommendation of the Assembly to preserve the forest habitat of the Christmas Island frigatebird. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assembly took a strong stand against the phosphate mining corporation in relation to mining of the lower western shores of Smithson Bight and considered in the land use survey of 1985 that the conservation habitats there were of international concern, with their outstanding coastal scenery and the high landscape and wildlife. In fact, as a result of the recommendations passed by the Assembly, mining of those terraces did not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like it to be noted by the Senate that, rather than an ordinance being introduced in this place at this time for the establishment of a casino on Christmas Island, it would be of far more use to the Christmas Islanders if they were to have their Assembly reinstated. They could then be responsible for their own affairs and continue debate, in the responsible way that they did in the past, on the issues which concern them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a previous occasion I indicated that my intention was to try to make some positive remarks about the report of the Council of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE). Events has proceeded somewhat since the report was first presented and subsequent information has come to hand with regard to the amalgamation. Nevertheless, substantially I want to pursue those same themes and some of the points raised with me by students from the various bodies associated with the proposed amalgamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do that, I take the opportunity to congratulate those involved with the continuing development of the CCAE. As the report indicates, it continues to be an outstandingly successful tertiary institution. I hope, and at this stage expect, that the virtues of this institution will be preserved in the development of the forthcoming amalgamated institutions. There are two particular aspects of activities I want to refer to before raising some of the students' concerns. One relates to the development of a faculty of engineering. I note with great pleasure from the report of the Council that some engineering courses are commencing and that bachelor of engineering courses have received accreditation. I look forward to the Council, with the Council of the Australian National University (ANU), taking advantage of the amalgamation to enhance the prospects of development of coherent and coordinated engineering courses at the amalgamated institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put on record my appreciation of the excellent work done by the Australian Centre for Local Government Studies at the CCAE and hope that, in the amalgamation with the ANU, that program will continue to develop and flourish. It makes a substantial contribution to the academic understanding of local government and also to the training of councillors and council staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The students at the CCAE, the ANU and the Canberra Institute of the Arts have raised a series of issues arising from the proposed amalgamation and it seems to me that three of those are worth referring to in the context of this Council report. The first is their continuing and reasonable concern that it should be a genuine amalgamation and not a takeover by the ANU of the other two institutions. There is continuing apprehension that that may be the case. My belief is that there is certainly no necessity for it to be the case. The indications that I have seen at the moment are that a reasonable amalgamation can still be achieved, and I expect that to be the case. I want to put on record that, although I support the retention of the name of the Australian National University for the amalgamated institution, I would be opposed to there being a takeover by the ANU of either the CCAE or the Institute of the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA> The students raised very reasonably-and very gratifyingly, for a group of students; it may not have been the case when I was a student at university-the desire that teaching should be explicitly mentioned as one of the functions of the new university. I regard that as an entirely positive proposal from them. As I have said, it may not have been a proposal the students of my era would have welcomed-we thought teaching was something that belonged in schools-but I think it is a very important part of a tertiary education institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point the students raised which I want to take the opportunity to reinforce and support is their need for assurances that students will be able to complete courses substantially similar to those to which they were admitted before the amalgamation and that students who change from one course to another will be given full recognition for previous studies, subject to the rules of the new courses. I think those questions of pursuit of preferences and continuity are important. The students have taken an essentially positive attitude, for which I congratulate them, and I look forward to the successful amalgamation of the three institutions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome this year the early release of the report prior to the Estimates Committee hearings. I believe in giving credit where it is due, and Estimates Committee D is giving credit this year to the fact that the report was released prior to the Estimates Committee hearing. It has been of great use to the Committee in providing a wealth of information in a very well set out document. By contrast, the Estimates Committee documents, the explanatory memoranda, are causing great difficulties because the Department of Defence has not been able at this stage to provide criteria for performance indicators which will be of use in determining how the Defence Department is meeting its challenges. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some concern to me that the Department of Defence traditionally has been able to operate behind a veil of relative secrecy and that so much information is deemed to be classified. Quite often it is obvious that material which could be made available to the public and to Parliament has not been made available. I look forward to the Department reviewing, perhaps thanks to the pressure of program budgeting on the Department, the amount of material which will be available to the public in future. In the past there has even been secrecy relating to wastage. There was a hard fought battle to try to ensure that information was continually supplied on wastage rates. We now need information on training levels in the total force, on the mothballing of equipment, on the likelihood that we are producing ships that we shall not be able to crew, and the likelihood that we are buying aircraft that we shall not be able to find pilots to fly. This information has to be known to Australians if they are to make a proper assessment as to whether the Government of the day is spending the defence dollar wisely and as to how well defended we are. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer briefly to some matters that are referred to in the report. One relates to the pilot retention bonus. It became obvious to the Estimates Committee that this was an ad hoc decision taken as a result of pressure from the Government on the Department. There was very little consultation within the Department on the matter and an old air force proposal emanating from some years back was pulled out of mothballs. The figures were not updated and no new studies were undertaken. Many millions of dollars were spent without proper thought and attention. It was a clear indication of the panic that was setting in in view of the loss of pilots. It has caused resentment among other categories of Defence Force personnel, who are also in short supply and who feel neglected and not appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad, however, to see that the Royal Australian Air Force acknowledges in the report that it is undertaking studies to try to maintain personnel numbers. The writing has been on the wall for a long time, and by now I would have expected studies to have been completed and action taken. I hope that the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into wastage rates, which will be tabled in the Parliament shortly, will give the Government and the Services the information they need on which to base considered action. I have great confidence in Mr Cross and his subcommittee and trust that he will be able to provide useful recommendations which, this time, the Government should accept, compared with his last report into the management of the Defence Department which was rejected by the Government-rejected at its peril because so many of the report's recommendations have a major impact not just on the efficiency of the Department but also on the morale of its employees. I trust that the Joint Committee report will bear out the speeches and submissions I have been making. I also would have liked to have dealt with Mr Cooksey's recommendations in respect of rationalisation of the defence facilities. His recommendations will require to be dealt with by the Government shortly. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) I wish to concentrate on the area of privacy. The annual report contains several statements which certainly have not been carried out religiously by the interviewers of the Bureau during the present household expenditure survey. On page 15 of the ABS annual report we see the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>Except by prior arrangement, they-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the interviewers-</PARA>
<PARA>do not make calls before 9.00 a.m. or after 8.00 p.m. or on Sundays. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. Indeed, interviewers have been calling on people after 8 p.m., and many of the households called on have reported to me that interviewers have called quite late. It is essential that the Bureau should choose interviewers who are willing to abide by its rules and regulations. Elderly people are being called on at 8.30 at night. I believe that 8 o'clock is too late for elderly people to be expected to open the door to strangers. I think that the Bureau should look into this area and ensure that its interviewers abide by the rules. On page 16 of the report one sees the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>A person should take such steps as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that information in his possession or under his control is securely stored and is not misused. </PARA>
<PARA>A member of the other place, Mr Cameron, visited a friend at a party held at an interviewer's house and found, to his distress, personal responses scattered in piles all over the lounge room floor. Also recorded in the columns of Hansard is a matter raised by Mr Hawker detailing a case where a farmer had been sent information destined for another farmer because of a mistake by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I am well aware that mistakes occur, but it is ridiculous for the Bureau to claim that it is able to avoid any privacy abuse. On page 21 we come to the crux of the problem we face on the household expenditure survey:</PARA>
<PARA>The second question of the relationship of legal obligation to respond to statistical surveys with considerations of personal privacy is a large one. </PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly not a question to be resolved by statisticians, yet that is just what the Bureau has done. It has said that the survey is legal. The Bureau did not table the survey and we have several legal opinions to the effect that it should have been tabled. The statisticians wrote to the Attorney-General's Department giving information on grounds that were very selective--</PARA>

I found it interesting to compare the present report with the Bureau's report of 1986-87. The Australian Bureau of Statistics was telling us in parts of that report about its plans for the future and about work in progress. Nowhere have I been able to locate in that report any reference to the current household expenditure survey except maybe a veiled suggestion on page 46 where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>

I would suggest that the interest that the Bureau has taken in putting 13 pages of this vital area of privacy and data collection by the Bureau into the report is as a result of the pressure that the Opposition has placed on the Government to make more public the way in which the current household expenditure survey was introduced and commenced. We see in the 1987-88 report on page 13 a comment:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, subsection 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 provides that each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the ABS must be laid before both Houses of Parliament before its implementation, unless the collection of information is to be made on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I had a constituent ring me up who said that she was asked to fill out a questionnaire of something like 129 pages. It included questions like, `Have you been to the doctor in the last three months and if so how much did it cost you? How much did you get back on Medicare? How much did you get back from your private medical fund?'. She was also asked to list the number of that treatment. Anybody looking at it could know what sort of treatment she had. Some of those treatments are very personal. Those numbers clearly identify what has happened. She was also asked to fill out a diary of her expenditure for a two-week period. The example that she was given included a bunch of parsley worth 69c. The example also included tickets to a hockey match. These are examples of the sorts of things she would have to put down. She would have to put down all of her income during that two weeks and all of her expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure there would be a lot of people in the Senate who would not want to put everything that they bought at a supermarket-one can buy lots of things at a supermarket nowadays-onto a form. In fact, if one lives in a rural area one may be interviewed by someone one might know. I know that the ABS tries desperately not to have someone that person knows interview them but it may happen. The ABS goes to extreme lengths to provide privacy with the census. A person can ask for an envelope, somebody can collect that envelope and they do not know what that person has written. Yet, we now have a very intrusive survey where people have to disclose details about themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> My complaint about the Bureau in relation to this household expenditure survey was not tabled. It was then tabled when pressure was brought to bear. I believe that one of the things that have happened as a result of that pressure is that the Bureau has had to pay more attention to the privacy aspects of its data collection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This is a privilege because I have been allowed to continue after Senator Patterson. Previously, I had made some remarks about the privacy area in the annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) where it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The second question of the relationship of legal obligation to respond to statistical surveys . . . is certainly not a question to be resolved by statisticians. </PARA>
<PARA>I pointed out that I believed that on this occasion it was the statisticians who had made this survey legal. They have done this by appealing to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) for a legal opinion. The information they supplied to the Attorney-General for that opinion was selective and inaccurate. During the Senate Estimates Committee hearing Mr Skinner of the Australian Bureau of Statistics admitted that he had sent a letter to the Attorney-General's Department regarding information requiring this legal opinion, which information was inaccurate. He admitted that the information about the methodology in the two surveys that required the opinion of the Attorney-General was indeed not accurate. He also told me that he had not sent the Attorney-General the questions from the 1974 survey and the 1988 survey so that the Attorney-General could make a decision on whether the contents of the two surveys were indeed similar or, as he cared to put it, virtually the same. He did not send the new form in the 1988 survey to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General was left to give a legal opinion not only on false information but also on insufficient information. </PARA>
<PARA> When questioning officers from the Attorney-General's Department they readily admitted that they had not sought any additional information. They relied solely on the information that the Bureau of Statistics had sent them. The mind boggles that the Attorney-General's Department should make a legal opinion available, one that the Australian people are meant to find credible and are meant to understand should be an opinion of some substance. Yet, the Attorney-General did not at any stage seek the correct information. The Department was told by the ABS that the content was virtually the same. It accepted those words. It did not seek to compare the content. It was told that the form was unchanged. It did not seek to view the two different forms. It accepted those words. Those words were not true on either account. It accepted the word of the ABS that there was only one significant change in the methodology. As I say, during questioning Mr Skinner admitted that that was inaccurate. Indeed, there were two very significant changes in the methodology and he had not reported that change to the Attorney-General's Department. How the Australian people can place any reliance at all on an Attorney-General's opinion when the Department does not seek the correct information that would enable it to make such an opinion is quite beyond my imagination. As such, I will continue to press on the people of Australia that I believe that the household expenditure survey is quite voluntary. It is only if they choose to fill it in, that they should do so. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) annual report is an excellent report on an industry that is booming in Australia, one that brings in something like $6 billion in overseas earnings. Ninety-seven per cent of our wool is exported. I draw the Senate's attention to one aspect of the report. On page 32 the Corporation states:</PARA>
<PARA> A change in the tariff status of imported lightweight fabrics in early 1988 will also adversely affect consumption of some wool fabrics. Wool fabrics up to a weight of 130 grams a square metre, which had previously been subject to a 2% duty, now attract the full 40% duty. </PARA>
<PARA>That rate has now been reduced to 35 per cent. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Cotton and synthetic lightweight fabrics were retained within the 2% by-law. The AWC is making representation to the Federal Government seeking to remove this discrimination against wool. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe Senator Button has asked the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority to convene a meeting of the major interested parties to discuss this matter. I would like to make the Senate aware of some investigations I have made on behalf of quite a few of the manufacturing companies which have approached me about this matter. They were concerned that after spending so much money on promotion, both here and overseas-out of a total budget of $300m, $179m was spent on wool promotion and it took five years to convince small manufacturers in Australia to use lightweight woollen cloth-the Government, in the harmonising of tariffs, should increase the duty from 2 per cent to 40 per cent, while leaving the tariff on cotton and synthetics at 2 per cent. There are quite a few small manufacturing companies in Australia which are using lightweight wool. They have to import it because of the quality of cloth they require. There are one or two local producers but, obviously, in the select area of garment manufacture there needs to be a wide selection of fabrics for those companies to compete in the reasonably small market. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the trouble to put out a questionnaire. Of the 100-odd companies which replied about half were not affected. Of the 40 or so businesses that were affected 90 per cent indicated that the tariff increases had affected them in a very serious way. The concern I had, as a former woolgrower, was that 75 per cent of them were contemplating using synthetic fibres to a greater degree and 22 per cent were totally replacing woollen cloth with synthetics. No wonder the Wool Corporation noted this in its report. Australia produces the best wool in the world. We are encouraging local manufacturers to use it so that people here can have the benefit of this wonderful fabric. The Government is putting a duty on the cloth which will put small manufacturers out of business. Twenty per cent of the people I canvassed said that up to 80 per cent of their business had been affected. Another 50 per cent said they had suffered significant reductions in sales. Fifty per cent of the respondents said they would not be using woollen cloth next year because of the new tariff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I consider the Australian Wool Corporation's annual report to be a good report. I congratulate the Corporation on it. It shows how much the wool industry has turned around in Australia in the last two years. There was a revival in prices in early 1986, but they have really taken off in the last 12 months. If honourable senators look at the table on page 28 of the report they will see that on 30 June 1987 the Australian Wool Corporation had on hand 381,520 bales, or 65.7 million kilograms. Exactly 12 months later it had only 1.5 million kilograms, or 9,203 bales. We are now dangerously low on stocks in Australia. Income to Australia has risen from about $3 billion last year to, as Senator Calvert pointed out, $6 billion at this stage. From what I can see it is still rising. As a result, the Australian Wool Corporation has collected more money in wool tax. In that period it has collected $17.805m. With a Government grant of $16.903m and interest of $8.4m the Corporation had a disposable income for promotion of $43m in the last financial year. So much for the good things about this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation was invited to put on a fashion parade in the new Parliament House during the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in September. The Corporation accepted the invitation. Honourable senators should bear in mind that the Corporation puts on woollen garment promotions right around the country, at all the royal shows, in shearing sheds, and in other places. It had agreed to put a show on here-probably the best showplace in Australia. It would have been shown on television to the rest of the world-at least to the Commonwealth countries and, no doubt, to other countries interested in that Conference. All of a sudden the Corporation withdrew its acceptance. On inquiry to the Corporation I was given the answer that it was short of funds and that the acoustics in Parliament House were not good enough. I replied that if the acoustics were good enough in an outback shearing shed they should be good enough in this grandiose Parliament House. I also said that if the acoustics were not right there were good sound experts around the place who could have made them right. I know the acoustics were no good here when we moved to this building but they are all right now. I consider that, in negating at the last minute its undertaking to the Parliament, the Corporation let down a very important industry to Australia as well as the fashion industry, which is recognised worldwide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the 1987-88 annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation. It is interesting to note that in Australia's bicentennial year our wool industry has reached a new peak of importance to the nation's economy. Wool regained its position as the leading export commodity, with an export value of nearly $6 billion. That is a lot of money in anybody's language, and it draws attention to the need for income equalisation deposits. It would be good if that scheme were reintroduced as it would give people a chance to improve their financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987-88 Australia produced its largest ever wool clip of 841 million kilograms-an increase of 3.4 per cent on the clip produced in 1986-87. It is no wonder that that is so because the sheep population increased by three million to 161,800,000 as at March 1988. Not many years ago, of course, the sheep and wool industry was suffering very badly. The Government should realise how much this industry helps it with overseas credits. Japan is still Australia's largest single buyer, purchasing 20 per cent of our wool exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Very important matters have been brought to our attention in this annual report. The year began with the implementation of Government legislation which gave increased responsibility to the wool growing industry for the management of its affairs. The wool industry is to be complimented on the tremendous amount of advertising it has done over the past 12 months or so. Its latest promotion campaign, a copy of which I cut out of one of the newspapers recently, is headed, `Mr Cool in Wool'. Having regard to the weather we are experiencing at present, there must be many people who are glad that the Wool Board is introducing new types of woollen material. This will mean that businessmen do not always have to wear very heavy woollen clothing. I compliment the Wool Board for the action it has taken in this regard. I also compliment the firms who feature in the advertisement `Mr Cool in Wool'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned some of the matters in the report. It provides very worthwhile reading. The members of the Board are to be commended for the tremendous amount of work they have done in preparing the report. The directors of the Corporation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a private member's Bill, introduced by Senator Coulter, entitled the Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation Bill 1988 (No. 2). The Bill replaces an earlier Bill introduced in April this year by Senator Coulter, which he subsequently withdrew. He substituted this new piece of legislation, which is based primarily upon that April draft but it contains a number of amendments and changes to which I will refer in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time the original legislation was introduced in April 1988, I expressed on behalf of the Opposition our opposition to Senator Coulter's Bill for a number of reasons. I gave those reasons as follows: firstly, we had problems with the proclamation clauses of the April legislation, which we believed could unnecessarily delay the introduction of legislation related to the protection of the ozone layer. Secondly, I expressed concern about the setting of an 85 per cent recycling requirement without what I regard as adequate calculation of the costs or the degree to which the Swiss technology from Unifoam AG, Glarus, would be available to manufacturers in Australia and elsewhere, and the extent to which a target figure in a piece of legislation may have been dependent upon a piece of overseas technology which may not have been generally available for patent reasons and for a number of other economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I believe that the way in which the Bill was presented failed to recognise the progress already being made by aerosol manufacturers under various voluntary arrangements which have been entered into in this country and elsewhere. Fourthly, I had some problems with the proposed system of inspectors, including the level of penalties, particularly those to be imposed on persons. Fifthly, I had some concerns with the question of the absolute export prohibitions which were contained in the April legislation. Finally, I had some concerns about the application of locus standi to virtually anybody defined as an interested person. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill currently before us, which was reintroduced and read a first time on 12 October, made a number of changes to the April Bill. The first of those changes was that the proclamation date was given a fixed establishment-that is, the Bill was to come into effect on a specified day, namely, the first day of January 1989, rather than on a date to be fixed by proclamation. The second major change to the Bill was that it extended the category of examinable documents to include books and documents related to `the manufacture' of ozone depleting substances. Thirdly, the definition of the word `sell' was extended to cover leasing or rent arrangements. That was a suggestion which I think Senator Coulter picked up following representations which were made to him by the environmental law section of the Law Institute of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, the prohibition of ozone depleting substance-containing products has been extended to importation. This would have the effect of preventing the importation, for personal use or as promotional giveaways-for example, aerosol cosmetics-of products which might otherwise still have been able to be imported into Australia under the terms of the April legislation. Former clause 11 (2) was deleted so as to prevent the export or import of non-conforming equipment, the manufacture of which was complete before the expiration of the period of grace, it being felt by Senator Coulter that the Bill should prevent what he called `offloading', perhaps to Third World countries, of equipment which did not conform with the requirements of the Bill, on the basis that those items ought to be safely scrapped in Australia under what he believed would be the stringent provisions in place here. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a new clause was inserted which absolutely prohibited the export of ozone depleting substances after the period of grace had expired. Senator Coulter claimed that that provision is necessary as manufacturers of ozone depleting substances in Australia, who are faced with substantially decreased demand as a consequence of recycling, may seek to maintain production by selling ozone depleting substances offshore. I think that those are the primary changes which have taken place in the legislation between the April draft and the October draft which is now before us. I, nevertheless, still maintain a number of specific objections to this piece of legislation. For that reason, the Opposition parties will not be supporting the legislation if the question is put to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I will detail some of those specific objections. As I said, the first is the question of the establishment in the legislation of a target figure, that is, an 85 per cent figure by volume which is specified in clause 7 (1) of the Bill. That clause reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>After the expiration of the period of grace, a corporation shall not use an ozone depleting substance in, or in connection with, the manufacture of any product or material, or for any other purpose, unless such of the processes of the manufacture of the product or material, or such of the processes in which the ozone depleting substance is used in or in connection with that purpose, are carried out in such a manner that, upon the completion of those processes, not less than 85 percentum, by volume, of the ozone depleting substance is collected and stored so as not to be released into the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the insertion of that clause in this legislation is unreasonable because, as I said in my earlier remarks, I do not have any evidence before me that that technology is widely and cheaply available in a way which would not interfere with the patents held by the Swiss originators of the particular process to which Senator Coulter has referred in his own speeches on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I refer to the absolute prohibitions which are contained in clause 11 of this Bill which provides that, after the expiration of a certain period the exportation from or the importation into Australia is absolutely prohibited where we may be dealing with what clause 11 (1) (b) of the Bill describes as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an aerosol product in respect of which the dispersion medium is, either alone or in conjunction with another substance or other substances, an ozone depleting substance. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall come back to that in a moment because the primary test upon which this Bill fails to attract the Opposition's support is the question of the use of ozone depleting substances in pharmaceutical products. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make clear that we do not believe in the mechanism provided for the issuing of injunctions under this Bill. The Bill provides in clause 13 that the Federal Court may, on the application of the Attorney-General:</PARA>
<PARA>or an interested person, grant an injunction restraining a corporation from doing an act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is then described in the Bill. Subclause 3 of clause 13 defines `interested person' in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>``interested person'' means an organisation or association of persons, whether incorporated or not, the objects or purposes of which include, and the activities of which relate to, the protection or conservation of the atmosphere or of the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, that means any person in Australia. So, any person in Australia who is part of what is described as an organisation or association of persons which claims that it is in the business of protecting the Australian environment may take action under this legislation in the Federal Court of Australia to seek injunctions to restrain corporations from doing certain things. I believe that that is simply an unreasonable test. I believe that, if it had been limited to the sort of fiat of the Attorney-General which is more normal in these matters, that would have been a supportable proposition. To say simply that anybody who is a member of any organisation which makes a claim, no matter how spurious or not, that it is involved in the protection or conservation of the atmosphere or of the environment, is a person capable of seeking an injunction under this Act is, I think, unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we come to the whole raft of enforcement mechanisms which are provided in this Bill from clause 15 through to clause 18. This provides that warrants may be issued in certain circumstances and that people may go traipsing around other people's property. For example, clause 17 subclause (2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>A warrant authorises the authorised person to enter the premises: (a) with such assistance, and by such force, as in necessary and reasonable; and (b) during such hours as the warrant specifies or, if the warrant so specifies, at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a regime established in which there will be authorised inspectors who have identity cards, who will be able to get warrants which will allow them to enter premises with such assistance and by such force as is necessary and reasonable. What does this mean? What are we coming to when we get a situation in which, once again, we have a whole series of pieces of legislation which allow all sorts of entry with force, entry at any time and warrants being given to various people. For example, the Secretary to the department, under this legislation, may by an instrument in writing appoint a person to be an authorised person for the purpose of this Act. We have had this debate on a number of occasions before. Senator Richardson has rightly drawn attention to the fact that there are a large number of pieces of legislation such as egg marketing legislation, primary industry legislation and all sorts of enactments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Banana growers, whatever it happens to be-which allow all sorts of officials to get warrants or to get passes to go traipsing over property, to enter by force and do all those sorts of things. I think at some stage there really genuinely needs to be a line drawn across the bottom of the page on these sorts of things. I think it is continually unreasonable to have mechanisms put in place, for the purposes of protecting the environment or whatever it happens to be, by which all of these authorities are issued. All of these warrants are there to be issued. Whilst the rights of individual citizens certainly have to be weighed against other public policy consideration, I believe that those rights are treated by this piece of legislation in a fashion which, frankly, I find somewhat cavalier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I focus specifically upon the primary issue by which I have judged this piece of legislation to be defective. I refer to the failure in the legislation to make a reasonable exception for the continued use and production of pharmaceutical and medicinal products which use ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the pioneering piece of legislation already on the statute books in Australia, that is, the Tasmanian legislation entitled the Chlorofluorocarbons and other Ozone Depleting Substances Control Bill 1987. That was introduced in Tasmania by the Liberal Government and indeed is a pioneering piece of legislation as far as the protection of the ozone layer is concerned. Clause 4 subclause (1) (a) provides the following:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of protecting the health and welfare of the community and protecting the environment, the Director shall (a) ensure that the use of controlled substances as propellants in aerosols be eliminated except where used in medical or emergency situations where alternative substances are not available;</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the second reading speech of the Minister in Tasmania, Mr Hodgman, we will see that he quite clearly indicates that there are a number of products and a number of instances where for proper medicinal and pharmacological reasons that sort of an exemption ought to be available. I believe that that is necessary in any piece of legislation. I indicate to Senator Richardson, who I understand will be bringing forward a piece of legislation in the course of next week, that one of the tests which will be applied by the Opposition in determining its opinion on that legislation-which I can say we would generally be very anxious to support-is that it should contain within its framework proper provisions for exemptions in the case of pharmaceutical and medicinal products. I gather from the indications the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, is giving that in fact that will be the case. As I say, that will certainly help us to reach the position, which I hope we will be able to reach, of giving the legislation support and speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course Senator Coulter addressed this matter in some detail when presenting his second reading speech at the time of the introduction of this new piece of legislation. He indicates, under the heading `Pharmaceutical uses of CFCs', that he is aware of the particular problem. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Australians currently release about 170 tonnes of CFC12 into the atmosphere each year from this source-</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about pharmaceutical products-</PARA>
<PARA>and Glaxo-</PARA>
<PARA>a pharmaceutical company-</PARA>
<PARA>state they expect this amount to rise and plateau at about 260 tonnes. The health costs of this release must be weighed against the health benefits. Increasing UV, consequent on ozone depletion, causes increases in skin cancer and other diseases. In 1982 there were approximately 3,000 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed in Australia. About 15 per cent or 450 patients had survival times of less than 5 years. Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the third most common cancer in women. </PARA>
<PARA> If one exempts this use in Australia then we must exempt this use throughout the world unless we are prepared to argue for our use and deny it to those in Third World countries. Extension of Australia's per capita pharmaceutical use to the whole world would result in a global release of 100,000 tonnes per year or one eighth of present release from all sources. I believe the health and other costs of this release would far outweigh the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>That, with the greatest respect, is one of the silliest statements I have ever come across. One might as well say if every citizen of China drank as much beer as every citizen in Australia, the world would be so awash in alcohol that it would be reasonable grounds for banning its production in Australia. I have actually seen such an extrapolation in one of Senator Coulter's earlier statements: that if every person in China used as much deodorant as every person in Australia, we would be in real strife. That is probably quite true, but the actual prospect of every person in China, or India or wherever it happens to be, using as much deodorant spray as every person in Australia is so remote that to make it a point of argument, a point of substance, by saying it is likely to be a reasonable statement that as a result of this there would be a global release of 100,000 tonnes per year and that would be absolutely unacceptable, just seems to me to be stretching the credulity of this Parliament even further than is normal in a large number of these debates. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not in any sense conceal the fact that I have a personal interest in this matter. I keep here in the chamber in my desk drawer my own metered aerosol device for the control of my asthmatic condition. I have little devices like this all over the place-in my car, in the office in Canberra, in the office at home and in the office in Sydney, and I carry one around with me permanently. I do not resile for a moment from saying that I am certainly not going to be voting for a piece of legislation Senator Coulter brings forward saying that these products can be banned in Australia and presumably I am going to wheeze my way into an early grave in order to satisfy him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins is not the only one who is likely to be attracted to that prospect just at the moment. I have studied the submission from Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd, as undoubtedly Senator Coulter and a number of others have done, and I think it makes a reasonable case that there is an absence of appropriate alternatives at this point in time. I think that the evidence put forward in an information paper prepared by Glaxo, entitled Pharmaceutical Use of Chlorofluorocarbons in Metered Dose Aerosols, makes it clear that there is no reasonable alternative available just at the moment. It is certainly true that skin cancer is one of the major health problems in Australia but, may I say, so too is asthma. Asthma is one of the largest killers in this country. It is one condition the incidence and severity of which is actually increasing. That may be largely due to certain other environmental causes. It may be due to all sorts of food colourings and additives, and air-conditioning problems, or it may be primarily, as Senator Peter Baume has indicated from the chair, the result of the wicked and evil habit of smoking. It is certainly not a matter in which one wants to have to weigh up the problems of asthma against the problems of melanoma. I do not think that is a legitimate approach to the formulation of decisions on a major matter of public policy. I am persuaded by the evidence that Glaxo put forward, that at this stage there are simply not reasonable, safe and cost-effective alternatives to the use of chlorofluorocarbons in key pharmaceuticals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply indicate the general approach which the Opposition takes to the protection of the ozone layer. It is one of the areas where I have no doubt there exists a fundamental bipartisan approach to dealing with questions of atmospheric protection, whether it happens to be the protection of the ozone layer or combating the problems of the greenhouse effect or whatever. In the Liberal and National parties' recently released formal environment policy, we state:</PARA>
<PARA>In Government, the Coalition Parties will pursue with industry and the State Governments, a timetable for accelerating the implementation of the Montreal Protocol for the protection of the earth's ozone layer. Australia will also take a leading position, in international fora, in the revision of the Montreal protocol seeking stricter controls. In addition, through the research work undertaken through Australian efforts in Antarctica, further scientific investigation on the effect of the CFCs will be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> Particular attention will be paid to the steps which Australia can take to ameliorate the world-wide impact of the `greenhouse effect', i.e. the warming of the earth's atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is no disagreement on the part of the Opposition that this matter needs to be addressed, that the threat to the earth's ozone layer and the impact of the greenhouse effect are of some importance and need to be tackled as a matter of urgency. We made that position clear when I spoke in the debate in the Senate about chlorofluorocarbons on 19 November 1987. I spoke about it also on 17 November 1987 when I moved to take note of certain treaty papers, one of which involved Australia's ratification of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. I made clear in a press statement on 21 March 1988 that the new figures coming from the Centre of Atmospheric Research in Washington suggesting higher figures for the depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer were a matter for considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties throughout Australia have taken this matter very seriously. The Tasmanian State Government has introduced pioneering legislation, to which I have already referred. The Minister for Environment in New South Wales, the Hon. Tim Moore, has written to Senator Richardson indicating to him that it is the intention of the New South Wales State Government to introduce legislation, although of course he made it quite clear that he hoped that it would be legislation complementary to all States and jurisdictions around Australia and that a unified national strategy could be pursued. The Western Australian Liberal Opposition has given notice of its intention to introduce legislation in that State along the same lines as the Tasmanian legislation. Also, we are to have some legislation introduced next week by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I believe that will be an important piece of legislation. It will be capable-one hopes-of passing both Houses of parliament, whereas I believe that Senator Coulter's legislation is no more acceptable to the Government in its current form than it is to the Opposition. Therefore, when the Government's legislation is introduced next week we will have the opportunity to take major steps at a national level in Australia to combat this significant problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that anybody should seek to minimise the importance or significance of atmospheric problems which are being recognised at the moment as profound dangers to the earth's survival. I do not believe that all the scientific evidence is entirely in place. A number of questions need to be addressed-for example, I quote from an article which appeared in newspapers on 20 April this year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Paul Fraser, principal research scientist for the CSIRO in Melbourne and a member of the NASA Ozone Panel, said there had been a 2.5 per cent loss of ozone since 1979-but only 0.7 per cent of this could be blamed on CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA>I can refer honourable senators to articles which appeared in the Chemical and Engineering News journal in November 1987 and a number of other articles such as that which appeared on 5 August 1988 in the journal of the Institution of Engineers of Australia which indicate that the precise nature of all the causes and the complex interrelationship between the various causes leading to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer are still not well understood. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly not a matter of waiting until it is too late to do something about this problem. However, it is a matter of taking steps which are practicable and that is the bottom line in this debate, not the fact that something needs to be done now. Something does need to be done now but the question is: what can be done now that is practicable? I put it to the Senate that the piece of legislation before us from Senator Coulter is not practicable. It is on that basis, and not on the basis that we do not take the matter seriously or we do not believe that action is required, that the Opposition parties will not support this Bill. We look forward to discussions with the Government over its legislation which will be introduced next week. We hope that the Government's Bill not only will be practical but also will go as far as possible in addressing this problem in Australia. On that basis the Opposition has made its determination about this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening not only to Senator Puplick's contribution, but also to the interjections of my esteemed colleague and friend Senator Sanders. I have to say that on this occasion Senator Sanders is wrong. I do not believe that Senator Puplick's approach has been irresponsible, weak or wimpish. In fact, as far as is possible on this occasion when we are dealing with one of the most critical issues of our time-the depletion of the ozone layer-I would hope that we could get a degree of bipartisan support. The nature of Senator Coulter's Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation Bill has some merit and I am not critical of everything in it. Obviously, it contains some innovative proposals. I know that Senator Coulter's view is that we should examine his proposed legislation and look upon it as being compatible with-or if not compatible, complementary to-the legislation which I have been developing. However, the difficulty is that it is just not reasonable or appropriate for me to say here and now that that legislation is either compatible or complementary. At this point I will not pre-empt the Bill which will be introduced into the Parliament next week. I do not think that is sensible; there are still some processes through which that Bill must go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I undertake to look at Senator Coulter's proposed legislation and consider every aspect of it. There may be some aspects which can be incorporated at a later point, particularly in regulations. I hope that Senator Coulter has the good grace to consider the legislation which I will bring in because there are some important matters in it which are not covered in Senator Coulter's legislation. My legislation will be far wider in scope and, in many cases, tougher. I have felt all along that, if we were to have legislation on this matter, it had to be able to meet with some acceptance from industry and be implemented by industry-Senator Puplick used the word `practicable'. Of course, we should not forget the role of the States. By the way, Senator Puplick referred to the Tasmanian legislation introduced by the Tasmanian Environment Minister, the Hon. Peter Hodgman. I have some queries about his deep commitment to the environmental cause. In this respect I mention two comments which Mr Hodgman made at the Australian Environment Council meeting held earlier this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The one I was at. Mr Hodgman said that bushfires were okay as long as they only burned bush. His other comment which I thought was pretty touching was that kangaroos would prefer to be shot, not poisoned. I pointed out that they would probably prefer neither if given the option. I know that the Tasmanian Government is desperately trying to look greener but it will have to do a bit better than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before turning to some of the specifics of things I hope the Government can achieve with its legislation, I wish to go into the background of this matter. The global decrease in stratospheric ozone that has occurred over the past decade or so is somewhere between 2 and 3 per cent. About half of this cannot be attributed to natural causes. The small amounts of ozone gases which can be found between 20 kilometres and 50 kilometres above the earth are known as the ozone layer. I realise that those gases are playing a vital role in screening some of the ultraviolet radiation which is present in the sunlight. Some of the synthetic chemicals, specifically chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons of which we use so much these days, have led to the depletion of that layer. That depletion has crucial implications for humankind. It is not just a matter of looking at the effect on the environment, it is also the effect on all of us that counts. The most common application of CFCs that we hear about-and unfortunately I saw this referred to out of context on the Quantum program last night as if it were the be all and end all-is their use in deodorants and sprays of all kinds. Later in my speech I will give the undertaking that Senator Puplick sought in regard to exemptions for some critical uses. Other wide applications for CFCs are in refrigeration, air-conditioning and solvents. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1987, after several years of negotiation, a diplomatic conference in Montreal, Canada, was arranged by the United Nations environment program and it achieved an important international accord. The Montreal protocol, as it was called, provided for early action to limit consumption of CFCs in each participating country at the 1986 level, with a reduction of 20 per cent by 1993-94 and a further 30 per cent by 1998-99. The Australian Government will certainly be going further than that. Of course, it should always be remembered that, in any event, the protocol provided for a review of those levels I think in 1990, and obviously Australia will participate in that review. As I noted in a press release of 18 September 1987, Australia supported that international initiative. It took an active part in negotiations that led up to the agreement. On 5 June this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I in a joint statement indicated that Australia would be signing the protocol, which is due to take effect from 1 January next year.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to sign the protocol I hope demonstrates the Government's commitment. We want to place the protection of the ozone layer as high as we can on the environmental agenda not just of the Government but also, hopefully, of the nation. Recent scientific discoveries as a whole-although there have been some conflicting ones-have indicated that for part of this year there have been further dramatic losses in ozone over the Antarctic. I hedged my bet there because one report I read suggests that it is less. I think this points up what Senator Puplick was saying earlier-that there is a need for more data before we make too many irreversible decisions. Nonetheless, Australia will press to ensure that the provisions of the protocol are revised in the light of what up to date scientific information, technical and otherwise, we can find. </PARA>
<PARA> If the review that is to be completed at the end of 1990 is to be effective it will require all nations that are participating to monitor effectively what they have done in the interim, and certainly Australia will be doing that. We have to work closely with State governments, and I have been successful in persuading some State governments not to persevere with their own legislation but to wait until legislation I am bringing in next week is on the table. I might say that it is not just a matter of looking at State Labor governments; basically all governments have been willing, except for Tasmania, to wait. I am pleased that that is the case because we need the concurrence of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to look at industry. Negotiations with industry are vital. I will not go over all the details of negotiations we have had with industry; I think Senator Collins will cover those negotiations in his contribution. The problem is that Senator Coulter has not consulted industry in drawing up his Bill and, unfortunately, the Bill reflects that lack of consultation. His proposals may have-indeed I suppose they have-the support of some elements of the conservation movement, but this is one occasion when we cannot proceed with the conservation movement alone. Without the States and industry we will have all sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 July this year I announced that the Government had approved the drafting of legislation to control these substances. Since that time my Department has been proceeding with the development of those drafting instructions. They will provide Australia with legislation which will include provisions to give effect to the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. The legislation will include provisions to ensure that all practicable steps are taken to reduce emissions of ozone depleting substances by a series of regulations which will control their use and it will provide mechanisms for the control of the manufacture, importation and exportation of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great strengths of the approach the Government has adopted in the development of this legislation is the extensive process of consultation conducted with the manufacturing sector. After all, it is critical that the manufacturers and the importers of CFCs and halons, the group most immediately affected by the legislation, are extensively consulted and involved in the task of placing Australia at the forefront of international action. Talking to officers of my Department the day before yesterday, the checks we have done so far on what nations around the world are planning to give effect to the protocol suggest that so far Australia will be going further than any other nation currently plans to go, and we will have been able to do that with the agreement of industry. So this is not a case where we can look at industry as the bad guy. I think industry accepts that there have been problems with what it has done in the past and it is prepared to change. I want to make sure that we take industry along every step rather than place it in a position where it will find it almost impossible to comply with government decree. Agreement has been reached with industry on the question of aerosol sprays, and again I have to say that for all but limited essential purposes the use of CFCs in aerosol sprays will be stopped by industry very quickly. That process is to be concluded by the end of 1989 and in one step will reduce the national consumption of CFCs by 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which I will introduce in parliament very shortly will regulate dealings with ozone depleting substances by restricting their production, import and export, and by controlling applications of CFCs and halons so as to limit, as far as is practicable, their emission into the air. So far as is practicable, no one will be able to start dealing in CFCs or halons unless they were doing so during 1986. Again, if we are stopping new players from entering the game, obviously we will make sure that there are more and more restrictions. So far as is fair and practicable, consumption and production over the next five years-I emphasise five years-will be limited to 1986 levels and will be progressively wound back. Within a very few years the supply of halon gases will also be frozen at the 1986 level. </PARA>
<PARA> I have announced several times in the past that the Government is determined to take all reasonable steps to exceed the minimum requirements that were laid down in the protocol. In consultation with the industry we are developing further restrictions. Many of these restrictions will go further than those that are mentioned in Senator Coulter's Bill. In some cases he has not even covered the areas the Government's new legislation will cover. There are real weaknesses in Senator Coulter's Bill in regard to restrictions, which is one of the reasons why the Government at this stage is unable to support it. Senator Coulter has failed to address some of the most important areas which the Government will be regulating. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I said earlier that this is neither the time nor the place for me to provide the details of the Government's Bill-certainly not before it has gone to Caucus and got its approval-but in a very short time Senator Coulter will see that the Government's Bill is far wider in its scope. Hopefully that will mean that he will think again. Just to give some examples of what I think is reasonable, Senator Coulter's Bill opts for 85 per cent recycling of polystyrene containers and packaging. The Government's regulations will go further than that, and I hope Senator Coulter will take that into account. Senator Coulter wants to ban aerosols outright. Senator Puplick pointed out that there was no allowance for emergency use, or exceptional uses such as international security or even personal security, let alone medicinal uses. Clearly, in some fire extinguishers, as an example, there is still a problem with developing alternatives and the Government has to be careful to make sure that we protect ourselves from fire. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as medical purposes go, I can say that I used to be an asthmatic. It is some years since I have had an attack. Nonetheless, because of 25 years experience I still keep some sprays around me. I would be loath to let that security blanket go. I know Senator Collins has difficulties from time to time. I know Senator Puplick does, and so do a lot of other people in this chamber and in the other place. Let us not forget the millions of Australians who are occasionally affected. If there is no allowance for that, the Bill is clearly deficient. It would mean we are going to lay down some unrealistic restrictions. But not only are they unrealistic; they are unsafe. We have a responsibility to protect those Australians who are affected by asthma and, unfortunately, for whatever reason there is a growing number in that category and so far medical science has not been able to find a better way of managing asthma than sprays, which do involve some use of the chemicals that we are seeking to restrict. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to be realistic, I hope, in dealing with those aerosols. We recognise the need for exceptions and exemptions. Therefore, I think I have given Senator Puplick the undertaking that he required. We are going to consider very carefully what allowances we need to make. We are covering both CFCs and halons. Senator Coulter is covering CFCs only. I think that is another weakness in his Bill. The Government's Bill will go further than the Montreal Protocol in regard to exports. Here again, I am not going to give the details now but I am confident that Senator Coulter will be pleasantly surprised by the legislation that the Government will bring in on this question and it will be done with the concurrence of industry. That consultation which has been going on with industry, by the way, will be an ongoing process. We are not going to stop once the Bill has gone through the Parliament. Not only do we need to look at the Montreal Protocol revision in 1990; we need, I think, to look at the progress of implementation of the Government's legislation. We need to look at whether or not we can have our own review and go further ourselves again in a few years time. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do I intend to continue the consultative process that I initiated some time ago; I am going to add to it by including an environmental representative. I think a representative from the environmental movement can have a role to play. I do not believe that, after the introduction of this legislation, whatever review we are conducting for its purposes or for the purposes of the 1990 review needs to be done in secret. I think it is clear that there is time now and room for the environment movement to be involved and I am going to make sure that we do that. A specialist committee will be set up to advise me on any special pleading that may arise from people who seek exemption from the strictures of the regime which we will introduce. That means that continued industry involvement will be there to make sure that whatever pressure is being placed on industry is going to be dealt with not just by whatever opinion I might come up with but, hopefully, by expert opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at a whole range of detail in Senator Coulter's Bill I note that there are many things that are not covered that need to be covered and there are many areas where Senator Coulter did not go far enough. I shall just go through a couple of those areas. In looking at refrigeration equipment, Senator Coulter is requiring valves for recovery and recycling; he wants to ban the release of CFCs to the atmosphere and he requires recovery and indefinite storage of the CFC. All of those are reasonable and indeed commendable goals. I do not dispute the direction in which Senator Coulter seeks to go, but to implement those provisions immediately would place on industry an unreal burden. It cannot do so tomorrow afternoon. The Government will, hopefully, show Senator Coulter a better approach, which is to go with industry in giving a reasonable timetable for all of these commendable goals to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the opposite of what happened to me in this chamber in the last couple of days, the fines that Senator Coulter seeks to put in the Bill for non-compliance are nowhere near as high as those that I will be seeking to bring in. We are going to be tougher on industry for breaking the rules that it has had an integral part in drawing up. I appeal to Senator Coulter to consider whether it is not better to wait for the legislation that I will be introducing within the next few days. He will have an opportunity to look at it. I would like him to wait until he has done that and then, over time, hopefully we can look at implementing some of the innovation which is undoubtedly in his Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared to go along with his Bill. He has not had any consultation with industry in drawing it up. We worked hard at the consultation process over the best part of 12 months. The consultation process has worked and I think the honourable senator will see the results that that consultation has brought very shortly. I am not against what he is trying to do, but he is going too fast and being unreasonable. We seek not to be too quick and we always seek, as Senator Boswell would know, to be reasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation Bill 1988, introduced by my colleague Senator John Coulter, which I point out has been available for scrutiny since April, I would make the comment at the outset that, as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, the depletion of the earth's ozone layer is one of the major ecological crises facing all life on this planet. Others include, as has already been mentioned in the debate, the greenhouse effect, land degradation in all its manifestations, and increasing pollution of the earth's oceans and waters. All of these are significant problems in themselves, but we must remind ourselves that nothing on this planet exists in isolation. Everything is interconnected. Perhaps that is the message of the bogongs. Importantly, human beings-each and everyone of us-are responsible for the welfare of all life on this planet. Regrettably, however, there are certain and numerous activities of human beings which are responsible for bringing all life on the planet to such a serious state of global, ecological disaster that it is the responsibility of all of us, including industry, particularly those of us around the world who hold public office and therefore have the ability and the power to act, to do just that-to take responsible action which will alleviate these dangers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Passage of the Bill before us today would be a highly responsible action for the Senate to take as part of Australia's contribution to resolving the global challenges which face us. Briefly, to recapitulate, this Bill imposes strict controls on the release of CFCs 11 and 12 and would enable the recycling of well over 85 per cent of these substances. Senator Coulter said in his second reading speech, `The problem relates to CFC release to the atmosphere, not the use of CFCs'. Again to quote him, `Recycling must be an important component of any strategy designed to properly address the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion'. In refrigerators, for example, when they require regassing or reach the end of their life, rather than the CFCs being released to the atmosphere, they can and should be collected, cleaned and recycled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also requires that all new refrigeration equipment, including air-conditioners, be constructed so that ozone depleting substances are contained, can be collected, safely stored and recycled. Recycling measures for other ozone depleting substances, including industrial cleaning and degreasing solvents, are also addressed in the Bill. In addition, the Bill imposes a ban on the use of ozone depleting substances in aerosols. As more information becomes available to us because of continuing research on stratospheric ozone depletion, we are seeing that the Montreal Protocol, which represents the major concerted action at an international level on this issue so far, falls far short of what is needed. I shall mention a couple of recent occurrences. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) called for a total world ban on the use of the chemicals which are believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield. The EPA believes that the 50 per cent reduction required by the Montreal Protocol does not go far enough. That recommendation reflects a growing consensus that the threat to the ozone layer is even more serious than was previously recognised. The call of the EPA was backed by an important American industry group representing manufacturers and users of CFCs and halons, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, the chief industry trade group in the United States representing both makers and users. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter's Bill has been criticised on the ground that it does not reflect the interests of the industry, and I think that we should be looking to the United States and its example when considering this Bill. The significant feature of the ozone layer depletion is the predicted and certain increase in skin cancer because of increased ultra violet radiation. With this in mind I draw the Senate's attention to a report in the Canberra Times on 21 October this year in which more evidence of ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere is revealed. There is interesting evidence from New Zealand where scientists discovered hard evidence on how that country is being affected by extensions of the Antarctic `ozone hole', as is it known. According to research teams, last summer ozone levels over New Zealand dropped by some 20 per cent for two days as the ozone-poor air from the Antarctic moved over that country. That is an interesting experience when it is considered that we do not even know at what point we may be subject to increased danger in that area because of the movement of ozone-depleted air. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that the Government intends to introduce its own legislation and, although that is not quite ready yet, I understand that its main purpose is to curtail production of chlorofluorocarbons. That is fine and is to be commended and supported. However, Senator Coulter's Bill points out that without strict controls over emissions of ozone depleting substances we are not addressing the immediate problem. Dupont is currently working on substituting alternatives to CFCs but these will not be available until towards the end of this century. The cost of setting up new plants to manufacture the substitutes is estimated by Dupont itself at $10 billion globally. In addition-and it is also a matter of concern-the substitutes are very potent greenhouse gases and therefore would merely exacerbate the problem of greenhouse warming. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that action is taken to ensure recycling and control of emissions. Senator Coulter's Bill would compliment the Government's legislation. In that area of halons, which are not specifically covered in Senator Coulter's Bill, and in the area of the need for exemptions for special purposes, the Bill provides for this to occur by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a practicable piece of legislation. The technology exists for the processes suggested in the Bill. The technology is available and what is suggested could be done within 12 months. Senator Richardson has said that, with the introduction of the Government's legislation, over time some of Senator Coulter's initiatives may be taken up, but in this, as in our other environmental global problems, time is something that we do not have. The Democrats put forward a motion on this matter last year, which was not supported by either Government or Opposition. Senator Puplick listed a lot of speeches he had made about his concerns in regard to ozone depletion. Lists are fine, but in terms of people who are in a position to act on such issues the way in which people vote is far more important. The Australian Democrats believe that this is complementary and practicable legislation. Any exemptions, which have concerned people somewhat emotively in this debate, are covered in the legislation. The Democrats implore both the Opposition and the Government to look seriously at the legislation and to support it. </PARA>

Therefore, I shall not detain the Senate for my usual 30 minutes. The difficulty I face with Senator Coulter's Bill was touched on by the Minister and he said that it applied particularly to me. I am disturbed that there does not seem to have been quite enough homework put into this piece of legislation in terms of what it does not cover-matters that I know the Government's legislation will cover. Unfortunately, I feel that what the Bill does cover, at least in the short term, needs to be left out. One of the myths I grew up with when I was a boy-perhaps it was just told to me to reassure me-was that at least asthma did not kill people. That was a widely held belief when I grew up. Unfortunately, it does kill; my mother died from it. The asthma cures that were around in those days pre-aerosols were horrendous. In those days a great many asthma sufferers died from heart attacks induced by the medication they had to take. I personally would find myself in extreme difficulties if I did not have available to me the same medication as Senator Puplick, as I have just discovered, has-and that applies to a great many Australians. Hundreds of people die from this disease every year. It is unfortunate that a subject that sticks out like a sore thumb has been overlooked in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my contribution to this debate I intend to cover one of the great deficiencies in the legislation, and that is the lack of essential consultation in the preparation of the Bill. One of the strengths of the Government's stance on this very serious issue-and, as Senator Coulter knows, I have contributed my views on a number of occasions in Senate debates-has been the extensive process of consultation that has been established with State Governments and the Northern Territory Government, as well as with industry, the conservation movement and other interested parties prior to Australia becoming a party to the Vienna convention and a signatory to the Montreal protocol. Under the guidance of the United Nations environment program, an international treaty-known as the Vienna Convention for Protection of the Ozone Layer-was concluded in 1985 and Australia became a party to the convention in September 1987. The convention established the principle that countries party to the convention would take appropriate measures to protect the ozone layer, that they would cooperate in scientific studies and exchange relevant information, and would develop protocol's specifying control actions. However, the convention did not set down specific control strategies. A protocol to the Vienna convention specifying measures to control ozone depleting substances was finalised at a conference in Montreal in September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been actively pursuing its attempts to regulate ozone depleting substances from the very beginnings of these negotiations and the Minister's Department has been involved right from the start of the international negotiations. In turn, the Commonwealth Government has been engaged in extensive negotiations with the States and with the Northern Territory. As is well known, State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory have universally supported Australia signing the protocol. All States except Tasmania have agreed that the protocol should be given effect through Commonwealth legislation. Indeed, it would be nice, as I am sure Senator Coulter would agree, to do this via international legislation rather than national legislation. The Commonwealth has been negotiating with all the States and Territories over the framing of the legislation which Senator Richardson will introduce, as he said, very shortly. It has been common ground between all the States, the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth that the various governments should frame legislation which is complementary throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the significant characteristics of this Government's period in office has been its ability when making decisions to consult extensively with relevant and interested groups. This process has ensured that decisions taken by the Government have largely enjoyed the support of the public. The process of consultation is particularly vital, given the critical nature of this issue. Protection of the ozone layer is relevant to all Australians, and indeed all citizens of the world. In May this year the Minister met with the industry representative body, the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers (AFCAM). This is a government lobby group which was formed last year and represents virtually all the manufacturers, importers and consumers of CFCs and halons. For example, its members include Dupont, Monsanto and the largest importer, Lovelock Luke, and two of the biggest manufacturers, Chemplex and Pacific Chemical Industries. AFCAM's secretariat is based in Canberra to ensure that it maintains a constant and united front on behalf of the industry before the Government. The Minister's meeting with AFCAM was clearly fruitful. Very shortly after that meeting, the major vehicle of consultation between industry and Government was formed. This is the joint Government industry working group. The industry is, of course, represented by AFCAM. This is one of the major areas where Senator Coulter's Bill falls down. There has in fact been no consultation by Senator Coulter--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell the honourable senator that if there has been consultation with industry it is not reflected in Senator Coulter's legislation. The Government is represented by an interdepartmental working group consisting of representatives from Senator Richardson's Department, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and a variety of others. This group has been cooperatively developing action plans relating to measures to be taken by the various industry sectors to reduce emissions of these gases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then, the industry technical groups have been developing action plans for measures to reduce emissions of ozone depleting substances in the key user industry sectors. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has been closely involved in those discussions. The action plans formulated by those groups to reduce emissions have been the subject of extensive discussions between State, Territory and Commonwealth officials, key environment groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Total Environment Centre, and consumer interest groups such as the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> A large part of that discussion took place in a forum held in Melbourne in August. It is obvious from what I have said that the Government has put a great deal of work into the draft legislation which should be brought down next week. Senator Coulter, of course, would be aware of the forum in August that I have just referred to. Some 60 people representing all State departments, the leaders of sub-working groups from the joint industry Government working group, and representatives of key conservation and consumer groups attended it. It became obvious through those discussions that measures proposed for the majority of industry sectors clearly required progressive development over varying periods and Senator Richardson's legislation will be tailored to meet that need. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson intends to further develop strategies for reduction of emissions through the same consultative process after the legislation is enacted The Minister intends, for example, to maintain the Government industry working group and to enhance its expertise by the appointment of a representative of the environment movement. I have no doubt that Senator Coulter's Bill, as the Minister said, has the support of some elements of the environment movement. But that, in this problem, is not sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> To effectively comply with the Montreal protocol and indeed to make any attempts whatsoever to go further, the cooperation of industry and States is absolutely essential. This Government is not about heavy handed unilateral controls. As I have said, one of its great strengths is the ability and willingness to carry out consultation with interested parties to achieve the desired result. Every one of us recognises the serious problems caused by depletion of the ozone layer. The Government is treating the problem seriously, but at the same time it has to be done realistically. This is where Senator Coulter's Bill falls down. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not seeking to achieve the impossible. We are, in fact, going to do all that is possible. The actions of the Government will ensure that Australia goes far beyond the requirements of the Montreal protocol and it will be at the forefront of international action on this issue. Indeed, may I say, that I believe that the Bill which the Minister will introduce shortly will become a watershed in terms of law that exists around the world in the treatment of this serious problem. I know that Senator Richardson's Bill will in fact go much further in many areas than Senator Coulter's Bill does. One of the difficulties, if I can just address the position that Senator Coulter has adopted, is that his Bill could be treated as complementary to the Government's legislation. Unfortunately-and I have examined the Bill very carefully-it cannot.The two simply do not meld together very well at all. </PARA>

Perhaps Senator Coulter was not listening. As I said before, I am confident that the Government's legislation will go further than Senator Coulter's legislation in certain areas, particularly in addressing the areas that were outlined in detail by the Minister half an hour ago in relation to those areas of emissions that Senator Coulter's Bill does not even deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that interjection I have to make the point again that one of the disturbing aspects of Senator Coulter's legislation that concerns me is that the problem of unilaterally banning all these aerosol packs would instantly remove-and it is Senator Coulter's legislation-the ability of asthmatics to have access to those kinds of medicaments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made this point once before and I will make it again. It is such an obvious problem. It is not a small problem. Millions of Australians suffer from this disease. Millions of Australians use aerosols. The disturbing aspect of the absolute failure of Senator Coulter's Bill to provide exceptions is disturbing in the sense that it is clear that Senator Coulter has not done the work required to produce a piece of legislation that will realistically attack this problem. Senator Richardson, I might add, touched on a number of other areas of vital importance such as the propellants that are used in certain fire extinguishers which industry at the moment can find no alternative for replacing. That simply is not good enough. I might add that it is unreasonable to proceed with legislation at this stage when we know that in one week-not one year, not in five years, not in 10 years-the Government will be introducing a major piece of legislation dealing with the same problem. I think that is probably as unrealistic as the honourable senator's legislation is itself. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I have no doubt at all that the Australian Democrats will give careful consideration, as they do to all legislation that comes into this chamber, to the major piece of legislation that Senator Richardson will be bringing down next week. I have no doubt-I am confident of this-that if it falls short of perhaps some of the Democrats' expectations it will at least receive the Democrats' support for those sections that they would like to see implemented in law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very worrying for us all that wrong assertions are being made as far as Senator Coulter's Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation Bill 1988 (No. 2) is concerned. It has been wrongly asserted that Senator Coulter has not made provision within that Bill for people who suffer from asthma and who, therefore, need ventolin sprays or for people who suffer from other diseases and who need similar sprays. It has been wrongly asserted that there is no provision for these people within Senator Coulter's Bill. This is simply not so. There is provision within the Bill for regulations to be brought in for any exceptions that are found necessary. I suggest that Senator Puplick and Senator Collins should look again at the legislation. There is provision precisely for exceptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to bring to the attention of the Senate that it was some 14 years ago that scientists first asked the question, `What are we going to do about chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which we are pouring into the atmosphere?'. We have had 14 years to think about it. We have known about the depletion of the ozone layer for at least the last decade, just as we have known about the greenhouse effect and other effects that have been mentioned. The ozone layer depletion and the greenhouse effect are related. Senator Coulter's Bill offers a very specific way in which Australians can help to save the world. There is a popular misconception that ozone depletion means nothing more than having to wear a hat and apply some suntan cream but I am afraid that it means far more than that. It is not so simple for us or for the plants and animals. We do share the world with animals and plants. We will all be damaged by an increase in ultraviolet rays. So the future of Australian agriculture, as well as the future of pastoralists and graziers, will be affected. In addition, the microscopic creatures at the base of the food chain and which live in lakes, rivers and the oceans, spend at least a part of their life cycle at the surface. They are also intensely sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. If the microbes and plankton are decimated the whole food chain topples. The most frightening effect of ultraviolet radiation may be that it is mutagenic. It destroys or alters DNA, the building block of life itself. In other words, the ozone layer protects all life from genetic damage. </PARA>
<PARA> I will address other issues which I believe have not been addressed previously. In the early 1970s, scientists discovered that supersonic flights by aircraft such as the Concorde, releasing nitrogen oxide, would destroy part of the ozone layer. This was one of the reasons the United States of America discontinued its supersonic travel program. Of course, military supersonic flights continue. Nuclear explosions produce tonnes of nitrogen oxides. Two years of above ground testing of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union and the United States destroyed an estimated 4 per cent of the ozone layer. The burning of the Amazon forests, a disaster in its own right, has been linked by West German scientists to massive ozone depletion. </PARA>
<PARA> The chemical industry was predictably outraged when Nature magazine published the scientific findings about the ozone depletion in June 1974. Fluorocarbons were a $3 billion a year industry. But within a few years of that publication, the United States, Canada, Sweden, West Germany, and Norway had introduced bans. So the chemical industry has had a fair warning and ample time. In referring again to ventolin and other sprays, we are sure that Glaxo Pty Ltd could find substitute sprays, and Senator Coulter's legislation would give it time to do that. However, Glaxo has given a simple `no' answer. We are sure that, given time, just as there are substitutes for other products in non-important areas, substitutes could be available in the pharmaceutical area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a legislative framework for methods to substitute or recycle CFCs used in all aspects of the industry. Our present voluntary system of withdrawing the use of CFCs is plainly inadequate. It is too little too late. I note also from an article in the Australian Financial Review in April this year headed `Aerosol industry under pressure' that researchers at La Trobe University have found cases of some companies falsely labelling spray cans to avoid consumer backlash against the ozone depleting characteristics of CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been stated that Australia uses a relatively small amount of CFCs on a world scale, but it has also been noted that Australians use, per capita, more than five times the world average of CFCs. In a previous debate on this subject an honourable senator from the Liberal Party of Australia suggested this was because of our insect population. It is true that we have a large insect population. We have a large one in the chamber now and outside Parliament House. We have learnt in an expensive way that simplistic chemical solutions are not necessarily the best way to solve insect problems. There has been considerable debate in this place on agricultural and veterinary chemicals and the problems that have arisen from their use. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly clear to ordinary Australians, although it is sometimes not clear to their elected representatives, that the issues of chemical poisoning, ozone depletion, the decimation of forests, and the greenhouse effect are all linked. Some people have spoken of the Gaia hypothesis. Whether this is seen as a scientific theory or a poetic truth does not matter. We are all in this together; and by all, I mean all of us-people, animals, plants, insects, even bogong moths and the microbes of the sea. Today we are charged with the responsibility of saving ourselves from ourselves and giving the world back to future generations. I wholeheartedly commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate and to put forward some of my thoughts on the legislation that was suggested in the first instance by Senator Coulter. I will also touch briefly on the legislation the Government will be putting forward next week. I have had some briefings already on this legislation today. (Quorum formed) The Government's legislation will be more than adequate to deal with the extent of the problem. In fact, I think it will be a good deal more adequate than the legislation proposed by Senator Coulter. It covers a number of the deficiencies which have already been referred to in Senator Coulter's legislation. It is more far reaching in its scope and it also provides a much more flexible means of exempting substances which may prove to be necessary. This point has already been touched on by other speakers. I am talking, of course, about asthma sprays. I am one of the few speakers so far who are not asthmatic, but I have a four-year-old child who is. I know that her mother and I, and millions of other Australians who are affected by asthma and who need these sorts of sprays and other pharmaceuticals, are very concerned to ensure that such people are not adversely affected by the sort of legislation which is being debated today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to touch on a number of background issues with regard to the need for this legislation. We have already heard a number of comments about the depletion of the ozone layer which in turn has meant a global warming of about 0.5 degrees centigrade over the last 100 years and has resulted in major changes in the earth's ecosystem-not simply from chlorofluorocarbon build-up but also from CO2. This in turn has resulted in the fertilising of a number of plants, which to a certain extent has ameliorated the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It now appears inevitable that some global warming will take place. Future government policies may be able to slow down this process. That is certainly what this Government is working towards now. I accept that this is consistent with changes expected from the greenhouse effect. There is a build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities, particularly by the burning of fossil fuels-for example, coal, oil and gas. I understand that about 3.7 million tonnes of coal would be required to service a 1,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant, which would in turn produce about nine million tonnes of CO2. So for every million people whose electricity needs are provided by a coal-fired power plant, one is talking about nine million tonnes of CO2 per annum. Incidentally, four tonnes of U308 in fly ash is also produced. </PARA>
<PARA> A continuation of this warming can lead to rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns and alterations in ocean currents. So far as Australia is concerned, a number of television programs have already dealt with the issues in recent weeks as a result of a continuing education program on the part of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Government. For example, Sydney Harbour would be even more magnificent; it certainly would be about 20 per cent larger. A number of marina and tourist developments in Queensland would be under water, as would, I understand, the new Brisbane Airport, which would be a considerable waste of the community's resources. There would be major climatic changes which would have enormous impacts on the Australian economy, particularly the economy of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> There is rare international scientific agreement that the greenhouse effect is occurring and that continuation of the effect at the present rate will double the CO2 content of the atmosphere in the next 40 to 50 years. This, in turn, would mean an increase in global mean surface temperatures of between 1.5 degrees and 4.5 degrees centigrade. There is considerable disagreement, as there always is, within the scientific community about the extent of that change. A global warming of this magnitude would lead to a sea level rise of between 20 and 140 centimetres over the next 40 to 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the result would be social and economic disruption on a major scale and associated health problems. The industrialised world has produced most of the problem because of its heavy consumption of fossil fuels. Some of the information I have seen indicates that 20 per cent of the world's population has been producing 80 per cent of the CO2 pollution and the addition of the gases which are contributing, in turn, to the greenhouse effect. In fact, the Senate committee of which I am chairman is inquiring into the environmental impact of development assistance, which in many cases has arguably been--</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 1, clause 2, line 9, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2 (1) Section 5 of this Act shall commence on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The remaining sections of this Act shall commence on 1 July 1988.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 2 removes New Zealand from the export market development grants scheme. Although there may be reasonable grounds for the removal of New Zealand from the scheme, the Government is proceeding in a way which can impose a fairly large burden on many of our companies who are exporting into the New Zealand market. The export development group of New South Wales-the Chamber of Commerce-has made the point that, in removing New Zealand from the scheme, the Government has failed to provide for any transition period for existing commitments and no consideration as to the treatment of export earnings from New Zealand. The abrupt removal of New Zealand from the scheme will also have a ripple effect on Australian exports, particularly export ventures with other countries, because some of our Australian companies, particularly the small ones that have initially concentrated on New Zealand because of transport cost problems will find they will have less income against which to claim grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the Government handled this particular removal and the way in which it handled the removal of South Africa from the scheme in 1985 are worth citing. In the case of South Africa, the Government gave extraordinary consideration to the long term obligations of exporters and their commitments to the South African market. These included continued and continuing eligibility of export earning generated from that market for the purpose of implementing the export earnings test and also providing for a period subsequent to the effectiveness of the amendment, whereby the long term commitments of exporters were honoured under the scheme until such time as they had expired. In other words, provision was made for an agreement with an agent who was being paid a retainer or expenses to carry out promotional work on behalf of an Australian principal. </PARA>
<PARA> While there were plenty of rumours around in the export industry about the continued eligibility of New Zealand and whether it would actually remain in the scheme, the formal announcement was not made until the May statement. That meant that exporters going about their business of exporting may not have been aware that there was any prospect of their going or they certainly could not have been able to make a commitment on the basis that New Zealand was about to be taken out of the scheme, until the time of the May statement. Hopefully if the scheme was operating properly, they would have made continuing commitments to that particular market. Many exporters would have had commitments running well past the starting date envisaged in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The sudden announcement with no consultation with the industry of the removal of this market from 1 July 1989 obviously causes financial hardship and disruption to market development plans and funding. For example, there is no provision whereby companies which have promoted mainly to New Zealand can have previous grants removed from their claim record for the purpose of calculating the effects of the export earnings test. This means that a company which may have promoted mainly to New Zealand for the past three years will have to attempt to cultivate those new markets with fourth year export earning tests of 20 per cent applied to their new claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment is a modest one in scope and in cost and is directed at a single item. That is to provide more time for companies to make alternative commercial arrangements with regard to their New Zealand markets. I believe that our amendment also makes sense in the context of the 1988 review of the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement. That will bring Australia and New Zealand into full free trade of goods across the Tasman on 1 July 1990. That seems to be an appropriate point with a full free trade at that stage because it would obviously be inappropriate to look at some of the support mechanisms which are contained within this particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Opposition has changed its mind from the statement it made earlier, particularly having listened to the fiery speeches of so many people on the Opposition side on how terrible it was to remove New Zealand. For example, I will turn to Mr Sinclair, the Opposition spokesperson. In a letter to exporters he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the sudden dropping of New Zealand's eligibility for grants will be ``traumatic'' for many firms . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then promises, in that letter, that the Opposition is committed to the maintenance of an effective program of export assistance. One way to do that would be to support this particular amendment. I hope that, as a result of the types of speeches that its people have made in this place with regard to this item, the Opposition will be able to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand many of Senator Macklin's comments. The Government will not support these amendments. In conducting a review of the export market development grants scheme, many exporters in industry associations wrote to provide opinions on the proposed amendments. Apart from exporters, almost exclusively dependent on New Zealand, it was interesting to note that there was general support for the exclusion of New Zealand. That does not answer Senator Macklin's point because he was talking about exporters who are largely dependent on New Zealand. The purpose of the scheme-and this was accepted-is aimed at assisting the development of more difficult export markets. The funds saved by excluding New Zealand are better directed elsewhere. A lot of people tell me it is easier to do business in New Zealand, in terms of export market development, than it is in Perth because the costs and distances involved are not as great. I think that the fundamental point is that the maintenance of such a scheme in New Zealand is inconsistent with closer economic relations. We have to think of Australia and New Zealand as one market, not separate markets. The more we clutter the pathway to that vision of one market, with bits of legislation like this, the more difficult it becomes. The Government will not accept this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as Senator Macklin's point about South Africa is concerned, the opening of markets and development of markets in South Africa in 1985 was an infinitely more difficult problem than it is opening and developing markets in New Zealand in 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition that the Government has put to what I have moved seems to be somewhat directed towards a totally different amendment. The amendment that I put does not talk about whether New Zealand should be removed; it relates to when. I also mentioned that the closer economic relations trade agreement starts full operation from 1 July 1990, which is also the date in my amendment. I agree with the points Senator Button made and I in fact made them in support of my own amendment. It would be inappropriate to continue past that time. I was seeking a longer lead time to enable the types of commercial arrangements that were made to be honoured and carried through. The suggested time frame is far too small for the commercial operations which are in place. I suggest that that extra year will go a long way to alleviating the problems that I am quite sure Senator Button, as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, has heard about and certainly the problems that exist with the people who have been trading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this is a scheme to help people export, I would have thought that when one is phasing it out, one would do so in a way that does not damage those exports. The amount of money involved in this exercise is likely to be very small. I thought that it was a reasonable proposition in moving from one area to another or taking out New Zealand because of our closer economic ties and that we would do it in a way that does not damage those people. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Opposition's position, I am not quite sure why it is doing what it is doing because Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, merely said that it was not supporting the amendment. I think that is interesting and illustrates the rampant hypocrisy of the Opposition in the speeches that were made in this place on this very Bill. I suggest that those exporters pick up the letter that they received from Mr Sinclair-a copy was sent to all of them-which refers to the traumatic results that this action would lead to and which said that the `Opposition is pledged to a maintenance of this program' and then determine how they would vote. The Opposition has shown its typical hypocrisy by coming into this place and talking big, carrying on and now doing what it is about to do. It is an absolutely extraordinary exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a change if members of the Opposition stopped writing letters and said what it is that they are going to do, because the exporters, the various groups involved and particularly the chambers of commerce in Sydney and Melbourne, believed as a result of the communication from Mr Sinclair that they had the support of the Opposition. The letter used the term `traumatic', and made the pledge that the Opposition would be committed to the maintenance of the scheme. This is one way in which the Opposition could go at least some way towards assisting in this exercise. It is interesting that those exporters have now discovered, like so many other groups in the community, how they managed to get sold out by an exercise of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition runs around saying that this is a Budget Bill, but of course the Senate will be dealing with a Budget Bill later, a taxation Bill, to which the Opposition intends moving amendments. It is quite happy to do that. It has done it before and it will do it again. So there is certainly no basis upon which it can claim some type of principle that it will not amend Budget Bills, because it is going to seek to do that later today. I hope that those exporters who undoubtedly will be reading the Hansard record of this debate, who have an interest in this area because it affects their industry greatly, will compare what the Opposition does with what the Opposition said it was going to do in that letter from Mr Sinclair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I envy whoever it is who is going to have dinner with Senator Macklin tonight because he will be in such a good mood. He is always in a good mood after he makes such speeches about the Opposition. I have heard Senator Macklin make that speech on many occasions. It is good political stuff but the reality is that he has been able to make it on many occasions for the simple reason that since 1983 the Opposition, unlike the Australian Democrats, has exercised something of a self-denying ordinance in matters that relate to the Government's Budget. That is based on a statement put down in a quite formal way by former senator the Hon. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle when she was the shadow Minister for finance. She put down the considered view of the Opposition that in the main-she admitted there would be exceptions-the Opposition would allow the passage of the Government's key vital financial legislation which went to Budgets or mini-Budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We admitted two exceptions. I am delighted to have the interjection, because that means Senator Haines can go and have a good time at dinner too. She can go off with that wonderful feeling because she enjoys this debate so much as well. I simply want to say that I have outlined in my speech during the second reading debate the position of the Opposition. The Opposition said at the last election that it would abolish the export market development grants scheme, and one could say that it would be a bit inconsistent now to carry these amendments moved by the Democrats. The truth of the matter is that as a result of the policy reviews the Opposition has undertaken since that election there has been a commitment to continue the scheme through to its conclusion should there be an election and the coalition is returned to government. But as I made clear in my speech during the second reading debate, we do not propose to support amendments. We do not believe that that is the correct thing for us to do, so what we have done is draw attention to the fact that it was the Government which promised the continuance of the scheme, without any nibbling away at the edges, but it is the Government which has gone back on the quite extensive campaign it waged amongst exporters at the time of the last campaign when Mr Dawkins, then the Minister for Trade, wrote on his official ministerial notepaper what a strong commitment the Government had and how awful the Opposition was. We note that campaign and we note that this is another case where the Government, in the interests of reducing government expenditure, has seen fit to change its position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney has made an interesting intervention, but his proposition so little matches up with history that I think everybody now realises that it is one of those cases where the Opposition waves something around and hopes that everybody believes that the shoddy little exercise it is engaging in is somehow a principled one. The Opposition voted against the capital gains tax, the assets test and the fringe benefits proposal, and it is now saying presumably that those measures were not of consequence to the Government's Budget. Yet this one, which involves keeping for one extra year the application of the export market development grants scheme to New Zealand, is suddenly of great moment to the Government's budgetary allocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that Senator Chaney did not refer to the letter Mr Sinclair, the Opposition spokesperson, has been sending to exporters. I have been through the letter. For example, it says that the legislation is inimical to the interests of small exporters. The letter condemns the Government for giving so little notice to exporters of the change. It acknowledges that the dropping out of New Zealand will be traumatic, and then promises that the Opposition would maintain the scheme. It is an interesting exercise by the Opposition to have its spokesperson in the other place sending out a letter saying what the Opposition would do, while its spokesperson in this place says something else. In this place, unlike the other place, the Opposition could do something. Down there it can only talk, so Mr Sinclair sends out a letter and puts his proposition to the people in the hope that they will be fooled. Unfortunately he is dealing with a group of people who are a lot smarter than I think Senator Chaney believes. These are businessmen who have gone out there into the hard world, into the hard export world, and who can understand what the Opposition is up to. That has been communicated to us pretty clearly today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that we could not have seen the extra year's phasing in, through to 1 July 1990, when the closer economic relationship comes into force. That was the appropriate period, and it would have given exporters that extra year to engage in that exercise. That is what our amendment is asking for, and I believe that would be a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter. It would be a very small concession in terms of the overall legislation. I would hope that the Opposition can see that it is a small concession, and I am sure that if the Committee had pressed this amendment the Government would have accepted it. It is a small concession; however, it would have been a vital concession to those people who have invested heavily in the New Zealand market. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that investment in the New Zealand market is relatively typical of a number of small firms going into the export exercise. Even Senator Button has acknowledged, as I acknowledge, the difference between the New Zealand market and the South African market. The New Zealand market is an easier market for Australian exporters for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the similarity of regulations, the lower transport costs and the ability of a small company to cope with the transport and communications costs in New Zealand all make it a far different prospect from trying to break into the South African market. I acknowledge that, but what I was drawing on in relation to the South African analogy in 1985 and the changes that have been made was that those changes in the South African case were explicitly built in in a transitional framework in the clear acknowledgment that those firms may have made commitments which went over the closing date that the Government was proposing for export grants for the South African market. I think that was legitimate. I supported very strongly our disengagement from that market. I am not talking about that. What I am saying is that people have to make commercial commitments and the Government, in acknowledging those commercial commitments, was pleased to be able to organise them in such a way that those people did not have those commitments massively disturbed. I would have thought that this additional year could have been introduced. I am not talking about whether or not it should be taken out; I am merely talking about that additional year to assist. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Pages 3 and 4, clause 7, line 36 (page 3), to line 17 (page 4), leave out the clause, insert the following clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``7. Section 14 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (4). </PARA>
<PARA> ``7a. After section 14 of the Principal Act the following sections are inserted:</PARA>
<PARA> Persons eligible for grants</PARA>
<PARA> `14a. (1) Subject to this Act, a grant is payable to a person in respect of a particular grant year in accordance with this section. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) Where the person is a body corporate that has an affiliated company in relation to a grant year, and the affiliated company has made a claim in respect of the grant year, then, for each $1,000,000 by which the aggregate of the export earnings in the grant year of the person and the relevant export earnings in the grant year of every body corporate that was an affiliated company in relation to the grant year and has made a claim in relation to the grant year, exceeds $15,000,000, the grant entitlement of the person otherwise provided for by this Act shall be reduced by 10%. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) In any other case, for each $1,000,000 by which the export earnings of the person in the grant year exceed $15,000,000 the grant entitlement of the person otherwise provided for by this Act shall be reduced by 10%. </PARA>
<PARA> `(4) In subsection (2): `relevant export earnings', in relation to a body corporate that was an affiliated company in relation to another body corporate in relation to a grant year, means the export earnings of the first-mentioned body corporate while it was such an affiliated company. </PARA>
<PARA> Minimum eligible expenditure for a grant</PARA>
<PARA> `14b. A grant is not payable to a person in respect of a particular grant year if the amount of eligible expenditure incurred by the person in the grant year does not exceed $10,000.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The structure of this amendment is somewhat complex. It seeks to change the phraseology of the entire clause whereby the wording, which is `persons not eligible for grants', becomes `persons eligible for grants'. The effect of the clause remains basically the same with one major amendment. Instead of the automatic cut-off point, there will now be a phase-in exercise. Under the Bill as it stands the cut-off figure is $20m and fairly obviously problems will arise very rapidly in practice. The problem is that companies coming up to that cut-off mark will now have an incentive not to continue larger exports which will take them over the limit. In staying under that mark they will have the advantage of the export support. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, many citizens might find it difficult to understand why they are supporting a company that has $20m in exports. I think that is a fair proposition. I believe that we ought to be targeting these export grants in a way that is different from the grants scheme in practice at the moment. It ought to be a method that is linked to success. As Senator Button well knows, there are a number of instances, particularly in the primary industry area, where there is no grant in a subsequent year unless there has been a significant percentage increase in exports-in most cases a set percentage. Unless there has been that increase the company loses out entirely. So built into those primary industry schemes is an incentive for people to get out there and sell. The Government has now built into this mechanism a disincentive for people to get out there and export more. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is not possible by way of an amendment to this grants scheme Bill to put in the type of scheme I am suggesting, my amendment does something different. My amendment seeks to implement a phase-in operation. We would start at a $15m level and work up to a $25m level by increments of 10 per cent for every $1m. This would entice people to come into the scheme and to stay in it because the amount they would lose by increasing their exports would in no way be commensurate with the amount they would lose if, for example, their export earnings went from $19 1/2m to $20 1/2m. That grant would then cut out entirely. It is a case of the quick and the dead. I suggest to Senator Button that, if he were an accountant for a firm which was sitting near that mark, he would be giving advice to that firm to stay under the mark to bring in a better profit. Ironically, its profit could drop if it were more successful in the export area. That is not something that we would want to build into any export scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at costs under this arrangement, which I think is an important element, I have designed my amendment so that the total cost will equate as near as is practicable to the total cost under the Government's proposal. I suppose that one could design amendments that would vastly increase costs. I did not do that for the specific reason that I hoped the Opposition, in looking at this, would then say, `This proposition does not disturb the revenue and, because it does not disturb the revenue, we will be able to support it'. This proposition has also been supported by those people engaged in exports. I hope that Senator Button will look at it and see that it is a more sensible way of dealing with the matter than the sudden death exercise that is built into the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I wish to indicate our position on the Casino Control Ordinance-a position which is probably well known after the press coverage of the topic today. The Opposition has decided to oppose the motion of disallowance and therefore to allow the Ordinance to stand. The decision was reached after a great deal of careful deliberation, and we do not apologise for that. Some people, as I have noted from the press and elsewhere, have failed to understand why that due consideration should be given to this issue. But it is clearly an issue within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), as it was within most of the States of Australia and in the Northern Territory, which raises emotions and which is regarded as a particularly serious matter by a great many people in the community. It has become clear from the debate in the ACT that not only does everyone in the ACT seem to have a view on the matter, but that they hold those views most passionately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We thought it appropriate that all these views should be properly taken into account. We felt that there should be full consultation, that any individual or group that wished to put a view should have a proper opportunity to do so, and that all those attitudes should be taken to the various forums within the parliamentary party-to the shadow ministry and to the party room. We felt that ultimately within the party room all those on our side of the Parliament who wished to contribute to the debate should have the opportunity to do so. As the community tends to be divided on issues such as casinos-moral and social issues-so those issues raise the same differences of view within parliamentary parties. It is regrettable in some ways that the Government sees this issue apparently much more simply, although if one listens to the gossip around this place we hear that there are mixed views within the Government on this topic. However, unfortunately, any Labor members who expressed such a view in this place would be expelled for their trouble. Nevertheless, we do not apologise for the amount of effort and care we have put into making this decision and in the extensive evaluation of both sides of the debate that has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the Opposition has approached this question on the basis that it is a project which the Government is putting up. I am unable to say whether if we were the Government we would have been heading down the same path, but that is irrelevant. The Opposition parties have had to decide whether they are prepared to allow the Government's project to stand or would use the disallowance mechanism to force the project to a halt. As I have indicated, we are of the view that it should stand. In this type of exercise one tends to begin by saying that, where there are those in the community who want to enter into some course of commercial enterprise, the onus must be on those who oppose their doing so to make out their case. That is the way we have approached this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not keep the Senate long as the issues are well known and the arguments have been heard over and over, but I wish briefly to run through the arguments which have been most prominently put for the project and touch upon the arguments against it, and then put forward our analysis of the arguments. The first and major argument put for the project-and I talk of the project as a whole, the casino, the hotel, the theatre complex, the cinemas that we hope will be involved, and the shopping that will come with it-is that the benefits would contribute to what might be described as the overall tourism package of the ACT. We see some validity in that argument. We do not over-emphasise it, or see it in itself as the salvation of Canberra's economic difficulties now or in the future. Nevertheless, we believe that it will contribute to the overall package that Canberra is able to offer. One has only to reflect that the opening of the new convention centre in this city will not be to far away. When one is looking to attract conventions one has to offer a total package. The packages offered in my home city of Adelaide, or in the city of Hobart, are no accident and casinos are included as part of the night life in those cities. The ACT without those same facilities has that disadvantage in the total package offered. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the tourism infrastructure will be vital in diversifying the economy of the ACT. No longer can we look to continuing growth in the Public Service as offering the same economic future to the Territory that it has offered in the past. No matter which side of the Parliament is in government, there simply will not be the same growth. Furthermore, it is fair to say that there will not be the same expenditure on the national institution attraction of the ACT which has been the case in the past. We are not for a moment saying that that means the expenditure should cease. We on this side of the chamber are disturbed by, for example, the Government's attitude not to proceed at this time with the National Museum of Australia. We believe that there are worthwhile national institutional projects that should be proceeding at this time, but we regret that they have been dropped off the agenda. We recognise that the great expenditure on national institutions which has taken place in recent years is unlikely to continue at the same level in future years. Therefore, there will be a need to inject more private sector money into the tourism industry. In a way that is what will happen with this project because the casino and hotel will be built with private money, and the casino will provide some capital revenue for the purpose of adding to the community facilities of the city. The hotel that will be part of the total project also will add to the capacity of Canberra to service the top end of the market, particularly in the light of the market that will be available with the opening of the new convention centre. We therefore saw some merit in the tourism argument, although we do not intend to overstate the position. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also put to us quite forcefully that the project will provide jobs. Again, some suggestions as to how many jobs have been exaggerated, but a very large project of this type will create a considerable number of jobs in the construction industry. Similarly, a large tourism project of this type will provide a considerable number of jobs in the operation of the complex. One thing we can say about the tourist industry is that it is a job intensive industry. It creates employment and employment for Canberra is important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important. I touched upon the construction area. It is particularly important in relation to balancing the lessening of the other construction works that we have seen in the Territory. Whilst it might be said that jobs in casinos and hotels might be seen by some as somewhat lowly, nevertheless, they tend to attract young people. They provide opportunities for young people. It is regrettable that the level of unemployment among young people in Canberra, albeit a wealthy city, is particularly high. This project will offer increased job opportunities for young people. We would hope that they would use the skills and experiences that they gain in this industry either to build up a future for themselves in the tourist industry or to enable them to finance further studies that will allow them to move on to other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that this has been the experience in Adelaide. The casino does tend to attract a lot of young labour. People do not stay in it forever. They use it as a stepping stone to move on to something else that perhaps might give them greater job satisfaction and opportunity in the future. We in our debate on this matter certainly take into account the fact that increasing the tourist infrastructure in Canberra increases job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I touched upon the fact that this project is to provide capital that will be reinvested in other community facilities for the ACT, in particular in the theatre complex, the performing arts complex and also in a central library of the Territory. Again, I need to say that we were unimpressed by the way in which the Government sought to provide to the people of the ACT an inducement, arguing that the only way in which they could achieve these community facilities was to accept a casino. We thought that that type of arm twisting approach to the issue was the wrong way to put serious matters to the community. The public has a responsibility to provide proper facilities through its Government. The casino should not have been offered as an inducement although it was more than that. It was a clear threat that if the people of the ACT would not accept the casino they could not expect the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not approach our analysis of this matter on that basis. We sought first to analyse the casino and any social costs that might flow from it. Only after satisfying ourselves that those costs in the experience of what has happened elsewhere in Australia were not great, did we then look to these ancillary benefits that could follow. Once you accept that the casino is not an unreasonable proposition for Canberra then it follows that there is nothing wrong with attempting to get the best price out of the project for the total benefit of the community. We look at the performing arts complex and the library in such terms. Both will enhance Canberra for the residents of Canberra. Of course, the performing arts theatre will enhance the total infrastructure of this city and this Territory. We would say in passing-it is not totally relevant to the question tonight-that there is a lot of work that needs to be done on the theatre complex itself and whether it is the most appropriate theatre complex. A lot of work is necessary, as the Government has admitted, on the library and what is the best way in which to proceed with the central Territory library in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the reality that without significant private sector infusion of funds such projects would be a long way off. It will be difficult enough, I also say in passing, for the ACT to finance its recurrent expenditure if one looks at recent reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, let alone borrow some $40m odd as a basis for these community facilities. They would have been a long way off and if their development can be brought forward as a result of this total project, we in the Opposition think that that is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> We note, and we remind the Government, that under the terms of the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 the Minister must be satisfied as to timely arrangements for these community facilities before the Minister can give the licence under the casino. We assure the Government that that is something which we in the Opposition will be monitoring most closely. I touch also upon the benefit that has been put of a revenue source that will arise for Government out of the casino. It becomes relevant out of what I have just said about the difficulty that the ACT will face in meeting its recurrent expenditure. There is no doubt that the casino will produce a reasonable revenue tax. The figures are debatable. On the research that I have done, comparing the Canberra casino with similar sized casinos in Australia, looking at their build up period, looking at the type of tourist industries that we have in the ACT and based on a 20 per cent tax on revenue, it seems to me that the figure of around $6m in the start-up years is likely to be achieved. It is not a great figure when we look at the overall revenue requirements of the ACT. It nevertheless broadens the revenue base of the Territory and we think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me touch upon the arguments that were put against the casino and the way in which we analysed those arguments. Firstly, it was put by some that a casino in the ACT is inconsistent with the image of the national capital. What I say to that is that the casino in Adelaide has not destroyed the image of the city of churches. The Hobart casino has not destroyed the attractiveness and character of Hobart. What they have simply done is add another perspective to those cities and so it will be with Canberra. Let me move to the second argument that was put, that revenue and jobs will be at the expense of other gambling establishments and hotels. We acknowledge that there will be some movement of business from these other establishments to this new project; there always is. There is always a certain attractiveness about a new project. But, we have noted that this project has the support of most of the licensed clubs in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from obvious business experience that a new hotel will attract business from existing hotels, particularly at the top end of the market. There is nothing unusual in that. Those that were once at the top end of the market tend to fit into a different level of the tourism infrastructure. They adapt to the new market as it is and if they are managed and run well they will continue to operate profitability. They are, of course, well established and have lower capital costs. They are really competing on a different basis. I can see no reason why in the environment of the development of the new convention centre and the continuing development of Canberra they need feel any particular fear from another top end of the market hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the argument that has been put in this debate and has been put in every other casino debate around Australia and, that is, that such an establishment is at a social cost. There are always unfortunate cases that follow from any form of gambling. I remind honourable senators that the ACT has one of the most liberal gambling regimes in Australia, if not the most liberal gambling regime. There are many opportunities already existent in the ACT for which foolish people have the opportunity to lose their money. I must say, as I think I have said elsewhere, I find it somewhat ironic that we in South Australia believe there is a much greater social cost out of the gambling mechanism of the poker machines, whereas in the ACT it has been regarded as a much more socially acceptable form of gambling. It is even now endorsed by some of the churches which use it as a method of raising funds whereas roulette or blackjack gambling is seen as something that is of a greater social evil. Opposition members have had trouble seeing that argument. We recognise that there is an inherent danger for individuals in any gambling opportunity. We recognise that there is a need for public education and for public support for those who are unable to control themselves and behave sensibly in a gambling environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us put the argument in the context of the Adelaide casino. There has not been an indication of major increases in social costs. On the other hand, we see an establishment from Adelaide's point of view-which is probably the most conservative city in Australia-that is enormously popular both with local residents and with tourists, and, as I understand it, it still has long queues outside the front door almost every day of the week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to the next argument that was put against the proposal, which is that casinos attract organised crime. We on this side of the chamber are of the view that with proper surveillance and monitoring, the capacity of a casino to facilitate organised crime is much reduced and is, by some, overestimated. Again, we can look at the experience we have around Australia. I remind the Senate of the Hobart casino, which has been operating for some 12 to 14 years. There has been no evidence of a significant increase in organised crime. South Australia has an organised crime problem, but it does not in any way relate to the casino. The casino is not seen as facilitating organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to bring to the Senate's attention the fact that on behalf of the Opposition I visited the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in Canberra to raise this subject, to ask how concerned the AFP were about the potential for organised crime to be encouraged by a casino in the Australian Capital Territory. Commissioner McAulay, who has had experience of casinos in the Northern Territory, expressed the opinion, on behalf of his force, that they did not see it as a significant problem. Of course, there needs to be a proper regulatory mechanism. On our perusal of this particular Ordinance we accept that it has taken many of the stronger mechanisms out of each of the State experiences and has built up what could only be called a strict regime. In fact, some of my colleagues thought that some of the provisions were even somewhat draconian. We gave consideration to the organised crime argument but, on serious objective analysis, it did not seem to stand the contemporary test.</PARA>
<PARA> In the time available to me tonight I have presented the principal arguments-there are others as well-that were put for and against the casino, and the methodology we used to evaluate those arguments. I mentioned a moment ago that in accepting a development of this nature we say that there is a need for the continuing education of people to be responsible with their money in gambling establishments. We believe that that is a responsibility of the state. It is something that the Government should accept. I hope that projects will be developed within the Australian Capital Territory to educate people to be so responsible-it probably goes far beyond a casino-to educate people to understand that it is possible to treat a casino as a place in which they can enjoy themselves, as they do in the Adelaide casino, where they can spend what they can afford to lose and go home without any great social harm. </PARA>
<PARA> We use this opportunity to say to the Government that we would be unhappy if it sought to use the private investment which will be created by this project as an excuse for neglecting public investment. One has a suspicion that that is already the Government's approach to this matter. It is not an approach that we think is a legitimate one. The Government, on behalf of Australians, has a continuing responsibility to develop the national institutions that we have in this place and of which we are most proud. Our belief is that at the moment it should be proceeding with the institution that will be the National Museum of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, as the tourist infrastructure continues to develop, we hope the Government will not believe that that in itself will offer sufficient diversification of the economic base of the Australian Capital Territory, because in our view it will not. We think the Government should be looking for continuing diversification. There has been insufficient effort put in in that regard in the Australian Capital Territory. If one looks at the opportunities in high-tech areas linking in with the institutions of higher learning in the Australian Capital Territory, one will see insufficient commercial exploitation of these opportunities. While the Government remains in office, we urge it to do more in this area. The community has a right to expect from government leadership in this field, to expect a diversification of the economy of the Australian Capital Territory. It is not receiving that leadership at the moment. In the same way, we have seen inadequate planning by this Government in the slowdown of construction jobs that the Government has known for years would inevitably follow the completion of this massive project, the new Parliament House. There has been inadequate planning and we believe that the Government should be condemned for that. It should not look upon this principally private sector development as a total substitute, allowing it to abdicate its responsibility for long term planning, which we believe has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what I wanted to put to the Senate tonight. We have evaluated most carefully, as I think is appreciated from the time we have taken, the arguments that have been put in favour of the project and the arguments that have been put against the project. We believe that we have reached the correct conclusion. In other words, we believe we have evaluated the strengths and weaknesses correctly, and that with proper planning, supervision and education, most of the genuine concerns that we have heard expressed by some people in the Australian Capital Territory can be allayed. As I said when I commenced my speech, our decision, therefore, is to oppose the motion for disallowance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.28)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion for disallowance and I welcome the Opposition's decision to join with us in this matter. Now is not the time to dwell on the process by which it came to that decision. I do not oppose the motion because I look forward with great enthusiasm to attending the casino or to participating in activities there, but rather because I believe that the onus of proof is upon those who wish to ban private activities, such as investment in the casino and attendance and participating in the activities there, to prove their case, and that case has not been proved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this instance it appears that at least the Casino Control Ordinance will make it possible for individuals to invest in a major private development here in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which will create a large number of jobs and other economic benefits. Some people wish to ban those people from going ahead with the essential economic generator of that particular proposal. In an approach not dissimilar to that which was adopted by Senator Hill-although I hope not to be repetitive-I think it is necessary to examine the arguments that have been put against allowing such a project to proceed. As I said, the onus of proof lies on those who wish to ban individuals from engaging in what would otherwise be lawful activities. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one position that can be justified as a consistent, logical, legitimate argument against the casino, and that is if one is totally anti-gambling. I know some people in this city who have that view. They are opposed to all gambling in all places at all times. It is a perfectly legitimate position. It is not a philosophical position which I share, but I understand it, and they are entitled to hold it. Once one adopts that position one must come to the logical conclusion that one is opposed to a casino. I understand that. Many people hold that view. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that I am not persuaded by the other arguments that are put. Almost all of the opponents of the casino who have come to see me, who have written to me, who have written to others, who have spoken in public, are not anti-gambling; in fact, many are not anti-casino. They simply say that this would not be an appropriate place for it. They are concerned about the effect which gambling will have on our city, our society and upon the individuals within it, particularly with regard to corruption. They stress that this problem may increase in a city that is the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of corruption is not an issue to be ignored. It is inexorable logic that it is much more likely that illegal casinos will be run by criminals than that legal casinos will be run by them. Illegal casinos are, by definition, run by criminals; legal casinos, particularly when they are to be run under an ordinance as strict as that which we are addressing tonight, are not-and there is no record in Australia that they have been-run by criminals. There is no record that legal casinos have made the activities of organised crime any easier or that public officials in the cities in which they operate have been corrupted. My colleague Senator Calvert from Tasmania is often an advocate of the benefits that flow to Tasmania from the casinos there. Certainly, governments of different political persuasions over the years may have had policies with which I disagreed, but none of them have flowed from any allegations of corruption associated with the casinos. That remains the case in Adelaide and in Perth. In Queensland, where the corruption problem might be said to have raised its ugly head, it has essentially raised its head because of the money that facilitates corruption that has flowed from illegal activities, some of them illegal gambling. It is a matter of inexorable logic that illegal gambling is more dangerous in terms of corruption than legal gambling. That argument falls flat very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, as Senator Hill said, a closely parallel argument that a casino is not appropriate for a national capital. That argument is either arrogant or sanctimonious and, in some instances, both. There are people in this city who say, `I am not anti-casino, I just don't think it should be in Canberra'. I regard that as fundamentally an arrogant position. It is a position that in some way we here are better than other people or that they as individuals are entitled to put some image of the status of the city in which they live ahead of the young people and the working people of this city who will gain pleasure and employment-later I will refer particularly to employment-from the development of this project. People from other States in which casinos flourish who say that a casino is unsuitable for this city are either ignorant or sanctimonious. I do not find either characteristic particularly attractive.</PARA>
<PARA> I find somewhat amusing the idea that a national capital will be in some way undermined by the operation of a casino. It makes one wonder how poor old London and Paris cope. One wonders how those cities continue to survive as national capitals, because the casinos in London are rather close to Westminster. I suspect that the odd member of parliament might have visited them once or twice. In fact, I think the odd Australian member of parliament has visited them once or twice. Nevertheless, London manages to struggle along as a national capital; Paris manages to struggle along; and Perth, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin manage to battle along as well. I suspect that the capital of Australia will battle along also. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that perhaps, as this city is full of judges, politicians and public servants, there is some greater danger that these important public officials will be corrupted. In my travels over the years I have noticed that politicians, judges and public servants reside in Perth, Adelaide and London, and they still manage to survive. In fact, some public officials in cities around Australia, who I am too polite to mention, have been involved in corruption. Some have been to gaol for that activity. None of it has arisen from any connection with illegal gambling. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to make light of all the issues raised by people expressing concern about the casino. There is the initial moral argument which I addressed and which I acknowledge. A serious question has been raised about the adverse social consequences of increased gambling outlets. I do not want to say that there will be none. The social impact study, which I thought was a comprehensive and very worthwhile analysis, did not pretend that there will be no increase in gambling, or in the social distress that might flow from gambling, as a result of the casino. It stated that it would be minor and incremental and that most people in the ACT who are susceptible to excessive gambling are not short of outlets through which to exercise that particular weakness. They may wish to visit the many poker machine institutions-too many, some might say-the Totalisator Agency Board or, the racecourse, they may wish to gamble in other ways or they may wish to visit an illegal casino. They are certainly able to do so. I acknowledge that point; I gave it quite a bit of thought. Until the social impact study was available, I declined to indicate my position on the casino because I wanted to examine that very question. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always had a very profound concern about the social consequences of unemployment. I think that the people who express a real and legitimate concern about the social consequences of gambling forget that one has to weigh in that scale the fact that if this project does not go ahead there will be substantial adverse social consequences, profound and lasting, arising from unemployment. The people who will suffer that particular adverse social consequence will not do so as a result of any activity of their own, rather, as a result of an activity of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also argued that there is substantial community opposition to this proposal and that therefore it should not go ahead. Some very interesting arguments were put earlier in this debate. There is an argument that a clear majority of the community is opposed to the proposal. Some reference has been made to an absolutely bogus write-in poll which I will treat with the contempt it deserves. There has also been an attempt to analyse the statistics from an AGB McNair Marketing Research poll on the casino project. So far as I can tell by any reasonable measure, as one who has been looking at market research for many years, it was a bona fide, legitimate piece of market research. It has been interpreted as saying that a clear majority specified that the feature about the proposal which they especially disliked was the casino. I looked at that report as a consequence of that statement. I did not remember there being a clear majority who said that. I found that this clear majority was 35 per cent. That sounds like a Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen definition of a clear majority. It may be that the party of the person who put forward that view is not used to getting more than 14 per cent of the vote, so it thinks 35 per cent would be manna from heaven and it must be a majority. I have to say that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same opinion poll 59 per cent of the people surveyed said either that they were in favour of the section 19 development or strongly in favour of it, as against 28 per cent who disagreed with the proposal going ahead. I do not intend to say that the proposal should go ahead simply because one opinion poll said that the majority of people were in favour of it. I think that is a very weak argument. I simply say that the argument that there is massive community opposition to the casino is neither supported by the subjective assessments which one makes from speaking with people in a fairly compact city nor from published opinion polls from respectable sources. On that basis the very best one can say about the arguments against the casino is that they are not proven. I suspect the opposition is substantially weaker than that. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been argued that the money should be spent elsewhere. This argument is put, `Why should we invest money in a casino? We should build houses, the National Museum of Australia or refurbish the Royal Canberra Hospital', all of which I support. It seems to me a fairly basic question of public finance that one cannot take somebody's private investment and transfer it to some worthwhile public purpose. It is not possible to say to people who may wish to build a hotel, `Well, that's very nice; why don't you go and build the National Museum of Australia instead?'. That is obviously an absolutely irrational idea which flows from people who cannot tell the difference between public money and private money. It may well be-and I actually share the view expressed by Senator Hill-that it would be very good if the National Museum of Australia was built and built somewhat more promptly than the proposal that is currently the Government's policy. It is no big surprise to anybody in the Government that that is my view and I expect to be a slightly more effective advocate in the cause than some. It is absolutely irrelevant to the question whether a casino is built. It is not exchangeable investment. One is private, one is public. One is designed to make a profit and one is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Australian Government was certainly sensible enough not to invest in the casino and realised certain economic benefits that flow from it. There will be substantial economic benefits flowing from this casino also. I thank Senator Powell for the connection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Principally, I wish to talk about the economic benefit that will flow from jobs. There are a large number of others, but to some extent they have been covered by Senator Hill and I will not waste people's time by duplicating his comments. The original estimates are that the initial creation of jobs in the building of the section 19 project-not the little casino that is in the middle of it, but the project that will be generated by it-will number something like 2,700; the number of continuing jobs is something like 1,800. I accept that it is arguable that people who are advocates of projects, such as this, exaggerate the benefits that will flow, although to the extent to which I have checked it from fairly impartial sources, those figures do not seem too far out of line. Even if they are 50 per cent out, they are very substantial contributions. There is a very substantial number of jobs in a city that will need those jobs very badly, initially and in a continuing way. It also substantially adds to the diversification of our economic base, and the essential synergy from tourism and the convention centre that Senator Hill outlined means that each will be more successful because of the presence of the other and particularly for Canberra which is a city suited to the development of a convention industry. The casino and the associated facilities that will flow from it will substantially add to the capacity of that convention centre to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make two alternative points about these jobs. I refer firstly to the timing of these jobs. It is a very key time for the construction industry; it is a key time for the economy of the ACT and the region as a whole. The rate of growth here is just about to decline significantly. We have the conclusion of this very large project, the new Parliament House. We have declined in population and economic growth at the same time as we are about to see a very substantial increase in the number of job seekers coming onto the market over the next few years in this city. It is important that various initiatives be taken to start to provide the capacity for jobs for those people. The initiatives will not do it by themselves. They are not sufficient. It is a necessary part of any such package; it is not sufficient; other elements are needed, many of which I have spoken about already. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step, we have to get the construction industry on a plateau, at a realistic new level so that it can continue at a sustainable level after the peak of the new Parliament House. Therefore, we cannot go around building useless monuments because we need a construction industry. When there is a worthwhile proposal, the timing of it is very important and the sort of delay that some people spoke of would leave a very sagging gap, a very significant hiatus in the economic development of the city and of the Territory and the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to mention briefly that the jobs that will be created, particularly the continuing jobs, impact on that target about which we need to be most concerned. I refer to our youth. Although Canberra is blessed with a lower rate of unemployment than Australia as a whole, it still faces a substantial problem in youth unemployment. It is necessary that jobs are created that are particularly suited to the target groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put about the substantial contributions from the casino tax. I suspect some of the top range assessments about the revenue that might flow are slightly exaggerated but when taken with payroll tax and other flow on benefits there is a significant contribution of between $5m and $10m to the revenue of the Australian Capital Territory. Although that is not a substantial amount of money in a $900m budget it is a significant increase in the discretionary expenditure that will be available to that ACT Government. It will not have $900m to do with as it wishes. A substantial proportion of it is dedicated to salaries and other long term commitments that are necessary but unavoidable. The percentage of that $900m that is discretionary is very low and the $5m to $10m that will be added will be a substantial increase in the discretionary expenditure available to the new Government of the ACT, which I hope will be elected in February or March of next year, to enable it to carry out many worthwhile social projects. </PARA>
<PARA> I could add to that, as Senator Hill has already discussed, the community benefits following from the theatre and the library. It does not make sense to build a casino because we want a theatre or a library. When there is a worthwhile project available that does not have consequences that are unbearable and where there are such potential, substantial community benefits as the improved theatre and library which would otherwise cost the taxpayers of this country something like $30m, it is an obviously substantial and worthwhile benefit that ought to be welcomed by everybody in Canberra and I think will be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of people. There are a number of other points that in other circumstances I would have made, but, given the fact that the Opposition has now decided to support the project, I will not take any more time of the Senate other than to conclude by saying that, if an individual or individuals wish to establish a casino with private investment, not public money, I do not support a proposal that they should be banned from doing so. I do not believe that the arguments for banning them from doing so have been established. Therefore, I will vote against the motion for disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the disallowance of the Casino Control Ordinance 1988. There can be no doubt that this is an issue which has divided the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) community considerably and that there are very strongly held views on both sides of the argument. There has indeed been very intense lobbying on the issue over the last 12 months or so because we should not forget that it was in August 1987 that the then Minister for Territories-about three years ago-announced that there was to be a casino in the national capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has, over the time from then to now, been criticism of the Opposition for having taken so long to make a decision on the matter. I point out to the Senate that the Government did not table the Casino Control Ordinance until 27 September of this year, more than 12 months after it first started talking about it. There has not been a proposition which we could adequately look at until that time. No-one can suggest that during that time we did not take an interest in the proposal. We ask the Government a number of questions relating to what it had in mind. We certainly discussed the project at length with people in the community who were both for and against this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a casino in Canberra, of course, is not a new one. It has come up in the past. The issues, to a significant extent, are unchanged and relate to the character of the national capital and whether a casino is appropriate, the social problems that are associated with gambling and the potential for criminal activities. The arguments for a casino have remained basically the same although there are some new elements in the debate this time around. The predominant issues in this instance are of course the creation of employment and the diversification of the economic base of Canberra. One of the new elements is that we are moving towards parity funding with the States, and in fact we now have our own budget. The other factor not present when the casino proposal last came up in 1983 is the total development of the section 19 area with the provision of community and other facilities. In 1983 the proposal was merely for a casino, with nothing else attached. The consideration of the total package of factors has led to the coalition parties accepting that Canberra stands to gain more than it will lose out of the development of the section 19 proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The volume of correspondence I have received from those who are against a casino, with whom I have considerable sympathy, leaves me in no doubt that there will be many people disappointed at the decision the Opposition parties have taken. Equally, I am aware from the volume of correspondence I have received from those who favour the development that just as many Canberrans would have been disappointed had the decision been otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many people who see the need for development in Canberra and many, as Senator McMullan has just admitted, who are disappointed that the Museum of Australia has been pushed as far off the agenda as it seems to have been. We would all welcome the development of the Museum of Australia, not merely for the jobs it would provide during the construction stage and subsequently but for the heritage value for the whole of Australia that the museum, with its imaginative plan, would offer to all Australians. I hope that there will be an imaginative development along the shores of the lake, that there will be restaurants and other facilities, and that it will not close at 4.51 each day but will be a considerable attraction at night as well. I am even more disappointed that the Government is treating the redevelopment of the old Parliament House in a fairly offhanded way. I was on a committee some years ago that made recommendations about its future, which until now have been totally ignored. Any development has been put off for yet another 12 months, I imagine to the advantage only of the cockroaches who reside there. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the debate on the casino development has been a divisive one. Equally, it is no secret that there are very strongly held views within the Opposition parties about it and, if I am right, amongst members of the Government as well. It has been suggested-and suggested by some of my colleagues-that this matter ought to have been left for the people of the ACT to decide. The fact is, though, that from Federation until this time the Federal Parliament has had responsibility for Canberra, and this matter is with the Parliament here and now. I am fairly confident that that will not be the case for much longer, but the fact is that self-government has not yet been established in the ACT. When that does occur the Federal Parliament will no longer be involved in the sorts of decisions it has made in the past. We have not shrunk from the responsibility that devolves upon us on issues such as the one before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the 1983 proposal for a casino was that it should stand alone. We now look at a time when there is a need for employment opportunities in the building industry and for young people. We cannot go on forever merely building for the sake of providing jobs in the construction industry, but it is interesting to look at the most recent report of the Parliament House Construction Authority to see the impact this building has had upon the work force and the downturn that has flowed from its completion. That is no surprise, and one may be critical of this Government for not having looked at projects like the Museum of Australia and the development of the old Parliament House. By comparison, both are quite small projects, but perhaps they should have been dealt with and brought on much sooner. The work force here in June 1986 was 2,064; in June 1987 it was 2,241; in December 1987 it was thought to be 2,300; it was expected to have been 700 in June 1988; and in December 1988 it is expected to be 250. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures cannot be lightly overlooked. The project we are discussing tonight will assist to provide work for skilled workers who are residing in Canberra, and there will be flow-on benefits for the building industry as well as the service industries, the real estate industry and other parts of the Canberra economy. There are still quite limited private sector employment opportunities in Canberra, especially for young people, as evidenced by the high youth unemployment in the ACT. Tourism is an important part of Canberra, although we need to develop other areas. The drawcard of this project and its casino may well encourage some additional visitors. It may well mean that some people will stay an extra night in Canberra, and I believe it will add to the attraction of the convention centre from a marketing point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra does not have the same means of raising income as the States. We have no primary industry, mining or fisheries, and we have only a negligible forestry industry and quite limited small scale manufacturing which, while promising and developing, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded at this stage as a major employer or a major industry. Canberra has to look at other alternatives for raising income and providing opportunities. One might, with some nostalgia, think back to the grand prix that we lost to Adelaide. The success of it in Adelaide can only make one drool about the opportunity Canberra lost. The grand prix should have been here. The Liberal Government in 1981 proposed it, and I think we really lost something when we saw it go to Adelaide and did not fight to keep it. </PARA>
<PARA> The casino is not quite the same as the grand prix. It will be with us 24 hours a day whereas the grand prix comes and goes over a few weeks of each year. It certainly would have earned substantial income. The casino will undoubtedly have income, though perhaps not of the same substantial kind. It will mean opportunities and jobs, which cannot be dismissed out of hand. It is estimated that it will create around 3,000 jobs in the building and construction phase over three or four years and about 1,000 permanent jobs. These figures may be exaggerated; nonetheless it will create significant employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the consequences of the movement towards Federal funding and the basis of funding under self-government, additional sources of revenue must be identified. With an employer as large as the casino will be, one cannot help but contemplate that in addition to the revenue that will be gained from the licence fee, estimated to be substantial, there will be a significant amount of payroll tax, which is not available from many of the smaller businesses in Canberra. Without going into detail, one cannot help but think of the significance of the recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report. When we were discussing a casino in 1983 one of the reasons for thinking of it as being fairly unattractive was that any proceeds from it would have gone straight into Consolidated Revenue and been of no benefit to the people of Canberra. It would have been merely another income raising measure for the Federal Government. However, the money from this casino will remain in the Australian Capital Territory and will be dealt with, I confidently expect, by an Australian Capital Territory government, which will be answerable to the electorate for the moneys it spends and the way those moneys are raised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also significant that in 1983 there was considerable opposition, and vocal opposition, from the racing industry and the licensed clubs in Canberra, both of whom have been silent in relation to this proposal. The Licensed Clubs Association has endorsed the proposal with the provison that there be no machines in the casino-only gambling tables. One club only has spoken to me about its concerns and worries about the casino, but the Association to which it and the others belong has, as I said, endorsed the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other criticism voiced in 1983 was that there had been no social impact study of a casino on Canberra. That was taken care of in the 1988 debate. I refer to some of the points that that study made. It said that there was no significant evidence documented of any widespread problems to families and individuals resulting from casino gambling. It also said that, while there might well be a downturn in the revenue from other forms of gambling in the first few years after a casino opened, the level would return to pre-casino rates of growth thereafter. It also pointed out that the inclusion of the casino in the section 19 development would make the project more commercially viable than if it were not included and would support the inclusion of community facilities. It also reported that the majority of residents believed that a casino would make no difference to the character of Canberra as the national capital. Of course, I agree that that is a debatable issue upon which people have quite strong views. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that like alcoholism and drug addiction, gambling is a social problem which will not go away in spite of attempts at prohibition on occasions. For those for whom gambling is a problem Canberra already has many gambling avenues available with the poker machines in the licensed clubs, horse racing which takes place on Sunday in Canberra, Tattslotto, the TAB and lotteries of all kinds. In fact, there will probably be only about four additional games taking place which are not already here. Logic causes one to ask what difference could result from the addition of those games when one looks at what is already available. It is true that gamblers can perhaps lose money more quickly in a casino than in poker machines, but I suggest that this is not so when compared with betting on horses. I am told that it is as easy to place a $10,000 bet on a horse as on a roulette wheel. That is something I never expect to know or understand, but I have no doubt that substantial bets were placed on horses this very week. It is easy to place bets on horses through the TAB every day of the week. There is already plenty of opportunity for gamblers to lose their all if they are minded to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There were outcries in Tasmania at the time about the effect of a casino in Hobart and about the possibility of organised crime being involved. It seems very clear that that is not the case. There is no doubt that some gamblers lose substantially, but no one is suggesting that Hobart has deteriorated. In fact, all comments on that city seem to suggest that it has benefited substantially from the casino and the social problems that were talked about at the time have not eventuated. However, it is important that we should not be complacent. </PARA>
<PARA> Having studied the Ordinance carefully, I believe that if we have a casino in Canberra it is necessary for it to be as stringently run as any other in Australia, with the requirements that this places on the developer, the operator and the authority that will be established to run it. The Ordinance includes a provision that the Minister must be satisfied that the community facilities will be provided within the proper timeframe and I believe that the Government has made commitments in relation to what will occur on the site. The theatre will undoubtedly benefit Canberra and enable Canberra people to see productions which would not otherwise be able to come here. Equally, I believe that although we might regard a theatre as a community facility which should be provided by government, there is little likelihood that this Government will provide one. I think there is also little likelihood that a Liberal government would produce the money for that purpose, much as one might like to think that it would do so. The economy of this country at present does not indicate that that would be the case. Local theatre companies will also benefit from the other facilities which will then be available as a consequence. There is, of course, also the question of a library as part of the development. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of my colleagues have told me of their reservations about casinos in their electorates but in time they have found that these casinos have not been harmful as predicted. In fact, as I have said, I have been told that in Hobart the casino has been of benefit to that city. It is with some very serious personal reservations that I talk about supporting a casino licence for Canberra, but to enable the other aspects of the project to proceed, I support the opposition to the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal before us is the motion for disallowance of the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I have been preceded in this debate by the two senators for the ACT-my colleague Senator Reid from the Opposition and Senator McMullan from the Government side. Their speeches already clearly indicated-and my South Australian colleague Senator Hill, who is the shadow Minister in this area, represented the position of the Liberal and National parties-that both the Opposition and the Government are resolved not to support this disallowance motion. Therefore, in the eventual vote on this motion in the chamber, we all expect an overwhelming majority to reject the disallowance motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to speak briefly bearing very much in mind the representations that have been made to us as senators on this matter. I am not a senator for the ACT; I am a Liberal senator for South Australia. I have participated vigorously in the preliminary debates on this matter because I am highly conscious of the fact that Canberra is the national capital and it is appropriate that all matters concerning the national capital be considered carefully by all of us, representing every part of Australia. With these representations that have come from all parts of Australia in mind, I rise to reassure those who have written to us that their views have been most carefully taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I was persuaded to give enormous sympathy to those who argued against the establishment of a casino in the national capital. The views expressed by so many people in Australia were that they wished to ensure that the national capital remained above any kind of corruption which so many see associated with casinos-in terms of laundering money and other vices which have, in some countries, developed around casinos. I make the point that this argument was put most carefully by myself and many other senators in the discussions which led to the decision by both the Opposition and, I presume, the Government during prior discussions on this matter. It is clear that the national capital should be seen as a representative place that heightens all that is sound and good in Australia. Whatever may occur in building developments in this city, Canberra will be known pre-eminently for this Parliament building, the Commonwealth parliamentary departments and all the decision-making and activities that go on within them. For the citizens who live and work here this city is known for its schools, playing fields, parks and, of course, the national monuments such as the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery, the National Library and other great centres of considerable public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> A second matter that was put in representations to us was that we should weigh properly the serious disadvantages that flow to individuals and families who suffer great losses in gambling. It is the case that in every gambling institution in this country and overseas people lose. Ultimately, I believe that all but a very few who use gambling institutions lose. It is a fool who makes a habit of putting hard-earned money on the throw of a dice at a casino. There is no way that that person will ultimately go away richer. In my State of South Australia this loss has led to a number of small businesses no longer having capital to continue. Families are no longer able to own their homes. Family members are suffering from the loss of what many would call squandered money. </PARA>
<PARA> A third argument put to us was that the tourist attractions in this great capital city are so well established already that the proposal that a casino is needed to stimulate significant tourist traffic is not a convincing argument-it is marginal at best. With regard to the associated development of a theatre, shopping facilities, a cinema, or any other positive assets for this city and its residents, I would hope that the viability of these activities would lead to their being built anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth argument that was put to us was very compelling to me. By repeating it here I wish to reassure the many people who put their views to us that those views were not only received and understood by us, but also clearly put in the discussions that were held in our party meetings to determine the position that we should take in this chamber. They were received in a bona fide, genuine way by all my colleagues in the Opposition. The fourth argument concerns the getting something for nothing mentality which is overtly sweeping this country and undermining its values. In very many areas of Australian life, not least in the television media, advertising lures are put to the public as if to offer them something for nothing, or a lot for a little outlay. I believe that this is undermining a well-established concept-a positive value-reward for effort and the need to contribute to the community to get benefits from it. Clearly, this undermining of an established value is able to be represented by an institution such as a casino. There are thousands of Australians who, when they think of a casino, think of an enterprise which is luring individuals to enter into an activity in the heady hope of getting something for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> This understanding of values is concerning thousands of Australians. I assure those Australians that the best way to reinforce those values is by their own behaviour, their own good judgment, their own lifestyles, by their own choice as to what they do with their lives, and by the way in which they educate those around them. I stand with them in wanting to educate people to contribute positively to the community to ensure that there is an expectation, especially in young Australians, that to get a reward it is necessary to put in some effort. </PARA>
<PARA> A final major representation to us concerned the reinforcement of family values. It is possible for many of us to speak in lofty terms about matters that are dear to our hearts and our lives. Most honourable senators are family orientated and they value the family more highly than any other social institution in their lives. So to talk about the importance of sound family values is particularly important to us, especially my colleagues in the Opposition, those honourable senators whom I know best. I know that Government members would want to assert this in similar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years there has been a cry that, because Canberra is the only place in this country that allows X-rated videos to be distributed-moreover by mail order-it is the source of that kind of pornography. It is banned in every other State and in the Northern Territory. Thousands of Australians, opposed to the circulation of pornography, have called Canberra, to its shame, the porn capital. I say to Senator Richardson that we still need a remedy. The Government should join with the Opposition, which has called for several years for the national capital to be brought into line with all the States and the Northern Territory. Whilst this is a matter that many of us see as compromising family values and whilst an overt emphasis upon gambling would also undermine family values, the point I especially want to make is that this consideration was very much before the Opposition and, I understand, the Government when the Ordinance and the disallowance motion that are before us were being assessed. The Opposition spent several weeks in discussion and debate before coming to the decision-not by a great majority-to support this Ordinance which I believe indicates the seriousness and the quite genuine way in which the various elements of the debate have been weighed by us. I do not know one Opposition member or senator who has not conscientiously attended to the discussions and debate on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> My views, which take in some of the arguments that I have reflected upon in my speech tonight, were not compelling to my colleagues. Because I believe very strongly in the majority principle I am moved to support the majority decision arrived at by my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties and to vote with them on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as a sample of the representations I have spoken about, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this straightforward letter written to me by the General Superintendent of the South Australian Baptist Union insofar as it represents the views of 77 Baptist churches across South Australia.

<PARA>Casino Proposal for Canberra</PARA>
<PARA> The on-going proposal for the establishment of a casino in Canberra is a matter of great concern to members of the 77 Baptist churches across South Australia on whose behalf I am writing to you. </PARA>
<PARA> In the strongest yet most sincere terms I want to express deep concern and opposition to any proposal that a casino be established in the Australian Capital Territory or within close proximity to it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons for our objection-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A gambling facility such as a casino should not be contemplated in the national capital because it is critically important that the government should not only be above corruption but also be seen to be meticulous in its avoidance of any possible appearance of corruption. The national capital should, from every point of view, be a model city in the life of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The effect of gambling, particularly the losses incurred through casinos, has already been to the serious disadvantage of many individuals and families throughout the nation. Together with other community service agencies we can bear testimony to the deleterious effects on people who become caught up in casino gambling. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. From the tourist point of view Canberra has more than needed to attract tourists as the nation's capital. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. We are becoming increasingly concerned at the extent to which gambling is becoming rife in Australia. Constantly the media, be it the press, radio or television, bombards the constituency with ways of getting something for nothing or at minimal outlay. Inevitably envy and greed can only be the product of such efforts to involve people by the sponsoring organization. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government speaks much about quality of life for Australian citizens. If that is a genuine expression then on that ground alone a casino should not be established in the nation's capital. If there is not a clear overt demonstration of quality of life in terms of attitude and community standards as well in things material in the centre of government and parliament, then how can quality of life be argued for the rest of the country?</PARA>
<PARA> Baptist people are proud of their nation and keen to see it become a country where every citizen is treated fairly without threat or exploitation and is able to enjoy a lifestyle in which the current trends of increasing violence and crime are halted and decreased. Such an improvement is going to take the strongest possible commitment by those in leadership and individual citizens if the welfare of the whole community is to be secured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just do not have a love for the moths in the way that Senator Sanders does. I do not like them at all. Given the complexity of the casino debate, I think it is important that we look at what we are being asked to resolve today. The only issue to be considered in the debate is whether we should disallow an ordinance that allows casino gambling and provides for some detailed surveillance and control over that gambling activity. The only relevant questions to be decided in the debate are whether or not a casino is appropriate to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and whether those surveillance or control measures are adequate to protect the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not being asked to approve any particular package, any particular developer, any particular operator, or indeed any particular development conditions. Hopefully, those issues will be settled by appropriate ACT authorities and, given the goodwill and good sense of the Senate in the next few weeks, I hope that would mean by an elected ACT government. The new self-governing ACT obviously should have the last say on how this project will proceed. While it might be useful to canvass some of the wider issues of the total development package, we should recognise and I hope acknowledge that the Senate is not being asked to decide these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the arguments as they have been presented tonight and over the past 12 months-the main arguments that have been advanced against the casino proceeding-and I might attempt to rebut some of them. The first argument we hear is about whether or not it is appropriate for the national capital to house a casino. Obviously a casino should not be established in any of those capital areas of the capital, and we do not propose to set up one in the car park in Parliament House or on the lawns. Rather, it is proposed for the commercial heart of the city on an area of land which currently houses two car parks, a couple of very unattractive office buildings, the inadequate Canberra Theatre and of course the Civic Square, if it can be called that, all of which would be refurbished as part of this development. The development will enliven the city centre and provide it with a new entertainment focus. I think we are all conscious of the fact that it has oft been said that Canberra is not the most exciting place on the globe, or indeed on the map of Australia; that often there has not been much in the way of attractions and entertainment. This project, hopefully, will go some of the way towards addressing that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Later on I would like to refer to the economics of this project, but I think it is worth mentioning in broad terms that the casino brings with it an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, with 2,700 jobs during the construction phase and 1,400 permanent jobs on completion. It is very difficult for any responsible political party to deny the ACT that sort of economic opportunity. Over the years members of all political parties have stressed the need for the ACT to diversify, to widen its economic base. Here is an opportunity where all of us can assist the ACT in ceasing to rely almost totally on Public Service growth and Commonwealth capital works. Hopefully, it is an opportunity the Senate will grasp. </PARA>
<PARA> To prevent this development would be a total contradiction of all that those senators over the years have said on that very point. This nation cannot afford to keep Canberra as a mendicant city or a mendicant city State. I would be very surprised if that were not the view of the great majority of Australians. Indeed, the disallowance motion essentially proposes that we continue treating the ACT as a special, pampered place, that we attempt to quarantine Canberra from the economic realities the rest of Australia has to face. In this context it is interesting to refer to a survey conducted recently by Dr Geoff Caldwell as part of the casino social impact study. His team arranged for a survey of community attitudes outside Canberra on whether or not a casino was considered appropriate for the national capital. I was not surprised to find that the significant majority of respondents indicated a strong view that a casino would make no difference at all to Canberra in its role as the national capital. The National Capital Development Commission has indicated that there is no planning reason why Canberra is not a valid place for a casino. I cannot see any valid argument in terms of national capital planning principles or national sentiment that the national capital is in any way such a special or sacred place that it should not have a casino. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague referred to some of the social problems that spring from gambling, and I think that is one argument that does need to be canvassed. If the argument is about gambling, the logic of it is that all forms of gambling, and in particular the insidious poker machines, ought to be banned. There is no logic at all in saying, `You should not have a casino and you should continue with poker machines'. I have seen at first hand the sort of damage that poker machines can do, the sort of destruction they can wreak on the weak. That is well known in this country now because poker machines have been around for a very long time. There is absolutely no evidence that casino gambling in any way adds to that problem. There is no evidence that it causes new problems or increases the problems that are already there. For those who have the weakness, the outlet is always found. </PARA>
<PARA> The social impact study was specifically asked to address the issue and it concluded without any equivocation that it had not been able to find any evidence anywhere in Australia of increased social problems caused by gambling in casinos. I am aware that ACT opponents of the casino have referred to statements made by volunteer social workers on the Gold Coast that the existence of Jupiters Casino has brought about these extra impacts. The social impact study specifically checked this and it was informed by the relevant Queensland family services people that they were not aware of any evidence at all to support the claims being made by people here. Really, it is very difficult to look at those Australian cities where we now see casinos-that is, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Alice Springs, Launceston, Townsville or the Gold Coast-and claim that in some way life has changed dramatically, that civilisation as they knew it would never be the same again. There is no evidence that there has been a change for the worse in those cities because a casino has been established. In fact, I would argue directly to the contrary. Obviously, therefore, any reasonable person has to conclude that claims that casinos cause any large scale personal or social degradation are based solely on myth or prejudice. There is no evidence whatsoever to back up the claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid, in her contribution, referred to the argument that in some way casinos present an opportunity for crime syndicates to flourish or extend their interests; that they have opportunities to launder money via the casino or perhaps to control some other criminal activities such as blackmail, prostitution, bribery or whatever. But if one looks at the eight cities I referred to a few moments ago, there is no evidence that any of those things happened in any of them. The Casino Control Ordinance was drafted in consultation with legal and law enforcement authorities. It is pretty tough stuff. It contains the most stringent supervisory and control provisions of any legislation of its kind in Australia. The Ordinance was released for public comment in the ACT in July. The only negative reaction from the public is that some provisions appear to be too strict. Obviously the Government will undertake to consider any suggestions from any quarter relating to the control and management of the casino operation. We shall continue to keep the matter under review, but the reality is that what we have prepared has already stood the test of time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me place the casino in an economic context. Earlier I gave a broad outline of money and jobs involved, but if we are to give effect to the Government's aim-and I think it is the Opposition's aim also-of diversifying the ACT economy away from an over-reliance on the Public Service or on Commonwealth construction projects, we have no other way to go. The commissioning of an economic and industry plan for the ACT will identify potential areas of new industry and employment. We have already launched a new tourism strategy for the ACT which specifies targets in terms of visitor numbers, length of stays, and infrastructure investment. One hopes that the casino project will address part of the framework. First, as a private sector construction project the development will be crucial in assisting towards creating a gradual trend to more sustainable levels of construction investment in the ACT. With the completion of the new Parliament House there is a danger that levels of investment in the ACT will fall off dramatically. We must ensure that we can trend out of that problem, and this is a pretty logical way in which to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at Canberra's range of attractions, the best estimate suggests that if we could get one more night only from each visitor to the ACT staying here, this would involve additional expenditure of $100m a year in the ACT. That is an investment which the ACT simply cannot do without. Obviously the casino will provide one very big extra attraction. That argument is particularly relevant when one looks at the convention industry. It is to the area of conventions that Canberra has been looking for some significant and particular increase. Furthermore, an unusually large number of school leavers will be coming onto the job market between 1989 and 1993. This casino project will provide a particular focus to ease that problem. I suggest that that will be done in a way that no other project so far mooted ever could, particularly when one bears in mind the 1,400 new jobs which will be available. For many young people who will be leaving schools in those years there will be real hope of a job and they will not be forced to leave the ACT to seek employment elsewhere. The figures of 2,700 jobs in the construction phase and 1,400 permanent new jobs have never really been challenged. I do not believe the ACT can afford to do without this project. It must be remembered that practically every major group involved in private sector activity in the ACT recognises the economic value and need for this project. It is one time when the union movement and the private sector have been as one because they know the need for jobs and for investment. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the development as a whole-it is not being decided tonight but it is worth saying a few words about it-there is provision for new community facilities, particularly a theatre and a library. The site is worth an enormous amount of money. Preliminary estimates of the site value by Jebb Associates in consultation with Price Waterhouse concluded that the value of the site would be $57m in 1990 prices, assuming that a 20 per cent tax rate applies to the casino operation. The value of the site would increase by $4m for each one per cent by which the 20 per cent tax might be reduced. For example, the site value in 1990 prices would go as high as $77.7m if the tax rate were 15 per cent. Those estimates show just what sort of investment will be required for this project. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to community facilities, Tom Brown Pty Ltd in association with Rider Hunt estimated that a new 2,000-seat lyric theatre, a refurbished Canberra Playhouse and a small performing arts venue would cost between $36m and $42m in 1988 prices to construct and running costs would be of the order of $1.5m a year. In relation to the library, even with the savings that come from the scaling down or closing of the existing library service at Kingston, we are still looking at a very major investment indeed. This all adds up to some very big money, and I would have thought that an investment of that kind at the moment is precisely what the ACT needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the role of an incoming ACT government-and one hopes that government will be coming in the not very distant future, provided that Senator Hill and some others do the right thing. Decisions about this development will rightfully be made by those new ACT authorities. It is contradictory to suggest, when decisions on final project specifications depend upon market conditions at the time, that the Senate should disallow the Casino Ordinance today in order to allow a decision on the matter by the ACT in six months. Management of the development will require that the ACT government in due course will be in total control of this project. But to get maximum benefit in the decisions taken on the development itself one appreciates that a decision on this Ordinance will have to be taken as soon as possible. The Government will ensure a normal caretaker period of administration of the ACT prior to the House of Assembly election in February 1989, but we see no reason to stop taking decisions about the ACT in November this year. The Senate should simply vote on the casino issue on its merits. If it does, it has little choice but to vote against the disallowance motion which, if carried, would deprive Canberra of the only real light on the hill, the only real chance for employment and investment growth that Canberra so desperately needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly on the subject of the Canberra casino because I know many local people who will be very disappointed at the decision made by Opposition parties today which effectively will give the green light to the proposal. I come from Western Australia where we have a casino. It is out of the city centre on the other side of the Swan River away from the city, but I note that in Canberra the proposed site would form the third vertex of the parliamentary triangle. I feel that this is hardly suitable for the nation's capital; nor do I feel it is suitable for the nation's capital to become a gambling den. I am one of the people who were disparagingly referred to earlier by Senator McMullan as being opposed to gambling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no demonstrable demand for a casino in Canberra. It is just seen as a way to raise money and, as has been made very clear by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), it is a dollars and cents issue. The dollar sign is largely before the eyes of the developers, the Australian Labor Party, and now, unfortunately, the Opposition as well. In the short term, of course, it will create some jobs in the construction phase. The trade unions and builders have seized on the casino simply because of jobs in the short term, but surely there are plenty of other building opportunities as alternatives in the near or more distant future-such as a national museum, the new town at Gungahlin in the 1990s, more hotels to cater for tourism in the national capital, and the oft-called for library-theatre-hotel complex without a casino. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about organised crime. The thorough inquiry in Victoria conducted by Mr Xavier Connor, QC, in 1982-83 pointed out that there would be a substantial risk that in one way or another casinos would be infiltrated by organised crime elements. This reflected an earlier warning in 1974 by Mr Justice Moffitt in New South Wales as well as from various experiences in the United States of America in places like Atlantic City. Both Victoria and New South Wales have rejected casino proposals and, I believe, for very good reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to refer to the opposition by the churches. My own denomination in Canberra, the Religious Society of Friends; or Quakers, has spoken out strongly against the proposed casino. I note too the opposition expressed by the New South Wales Synod of the Uniting Church in Australia, the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn and just about every other church group in the city. They referred to the inappropriate nature of a casino in the nation's capital, questioned the economic benefits and referred to a likely massive increase in social and family problems. This has also been the concern of numerous community groups dealing with various social welfare issues. I believe this issue should have been decided by the people of Canberra after self-government. It is obviously an issue which crosses party lines. I commend the opposition by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who has the guts to stand up for issues of moral importance, as well as some people in the Liberal Party of Australia who opposed it until this morning and, of course, the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> In this matter I fully support my colleague Senator Jenkins's disallowance motion. My voice from Western Australia will not count for much but I feel that on an issue like this and, coming from a State with a casino, I should register my opposition and state my firm support for those people of Canberra opposed to a casino who have been denied a chance to express their opposition in the absence of self-government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly oppose this casino. I wonder why the Liberals crumbled under pressure. They opposed the casino. The National and Liberal coalition apparently opposed the casino until quite recently. Then it crumbled under pressure. I wonder who put it under pressure and what that pressure was that forced it to change its mind?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hobart casino has been mentioned in this chamber by Senator Reid and Senator Hill as an example of a wonderful establishment which has won the approval of all the local residents. That is utter rubbish. One of the most polite names it is called, that I can think of, is that giant white phallic symbol on the shoreline. It is besmirching the river view of local residents. It dominates the area. It has taken up valuable foreshore. As far as the effect on the community is concerned, if one walks around in it as I do, one does not see the high rollers coming from mainland States to play the big high stake tables. What one sees is the Moonah mums, the women from the working class suburbs of Moonah and Glenorchy, just mindlessly pulling away at levers on poker machines. It has disrupted the fabric of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this is being debated now at all and that the concept has been accepted by the Government and the Liberal Party of Australia is curious in itself. Why are the Government and the Opposition so keen to ram this thing through just before the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will get self-determination? Why are they so eager to put this in motion? They are eager because they are afraid that if this were left to the people of the ACT they would turn it down. That is why they are so eager to establish this now. They know that the people of the ACT do not want it. Yet, those who are behind this project and who have pressured the Government and the Opposition are so eager to go ahead that they do not want to take any chances because they want this thing to go ahead now. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we to do? We Democrats, and others in this chamber who would like to speak out against this but who cannot because their parties have already spoken for them, can continue to oppose it. We can oppose the casino now; we can continue to oppose it after the ACT elections. Hopefully we will have some members in that government. Hopefully other members will be in the ACT parliament who will be opposed to this. We have to continue the battle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Coulter interjected quietly, people will have to be gutsy enough to stand up and be counted. One thing that worries me is organised crime. We have bounced around this issue. Let us be serious. Let us look at this for what it is. Of course, this casino will be run by organised crime. Does anyone in this chamber or in this country really think that organised crime would let a money spinner like this go by? Does anyone really sincerely think that the present casinos are not run by organised crime? I come from America; I know about organised crime. I know about organised crime buying and selling labour unions and big businesses. Organised crime is not a sleazy little guy with a black shirt, a white tie and a fedora; it is big business. People in organised crime are in the business of making money. They run casinos. They run the casinos in Australia. They will run this casino. Why should we give them a leg up? Unfortunately we will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another issue-I suppose I really should not be worried about it-is the economic viability of the casino. If it does not work well who will bail it out? How many casinos can this country take? When Hobart casino was the casino in Australia people used to come from the mainland. But now, as Senator Richardson I think pointed out, we have casinos in all the major centres, plus Alice Springs and Launceston. How big is the pool of gamblers? Will we have to increase the pool of gamblers to make this thing viable or will it simply be taking people away who would gamble on the dogs and horses? What will happen if, in fact, the gamblers do not come to the casino? Who is going to bail it out-the Government probably or the citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also heard about the value of the casino as a construction project. How long will we try to run an economy on the basis of constantly building things? What a naive view; what a sophomoric view, a high school view, of how to run an economy by saying, `Build something else because we now have a Parliament House. Let's find something else to build'. I ask Senator Walsh: Is that the most imaginative economic prospect we have? Do we have to continue to build things? Is that the only way we can run an economy? Cannot we be more imaginative than that in the late twentieth century? I guess not. If we must build something, why not the national museum? That has been suggested before tonight and it has been suggested tonight in this chamber. Why not build a national museum if we must build something? Why not? We cannot build it because there is no big money in it. It is something that would benefit all of Australia and not just a few rich entrepreneurs. That is why we are not going to get the national museum. Why not build some low cost housing around Canberra? Why not do what the Australian Labor Party is supposed to be doing rather than just giving a benefit to its rich buddies, the rich multinationals and the rich Australian nationals? Let us do something for the people. The best thing we can do for the people is stop the construction of this casino immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion, which is, of course, a motion to disallow the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 which if not disallowed will provide for the construction of a casino complex in Canberra. In doing so, I want to express some personal views on this matter, personal views which in part, I concede freely, stem from the fact that for over 30 years, with some absences overseas, I was a resident of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) before wiser counsels prevailed, shall I say. Partly for that reason, I still have many friends and former colleagues in the Capital Territory. I am particularly aware-quite apart from the information which I imagine most senators have been deluged with on this matter over recent weeks-that the casino proposal has been vigorously opposed by many whom I make no bones about describing as the most decent people in Canberra. Many of them are my personal friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have, of course, heard arguments, particularly from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, who has just left the chamber, that the ACT must have this casino in order to sustain the construction industry. What a total nonsense to put forward as an argument for such a proposal. What we have is an unholy alliance of contractors with the Builders Labourers Federation. There is a peculiar irony in honourable senators preparing to so move as to allow the casino complex to proceed. That is what it boils down to in practice. It is peculiarly appropriate that we should be doing that in this Parliament House which is itself, as we are rapidly coming to discover, a white elephant, a monument to the same unholy alliance to which I have just referred of contractors and the Builders Labourers Federation. </PARA>

<PARA> I find it passing strange in any case to have it suggested that somehow the property development on section 19 in the ACT, in Canberra city, cannot proceed unless the casino is part of it. I do not want to spend time debating the rather sad issues now. Earlier this evening we heard speeches by three senators on my side of the chamber. We heard speeches by Senator Hill and Senator Reid in support of the proposal, and we heard Senator Teague expressing-I do not wish to misrepresent or criticise Senator Teague; he is no longer here in any case-the gravest doubts about the proposal while at the same time quite properly indicating his intention to vote in accordance with the decision on this matter of the coalition joint party room. </PARA>
<PARA> In coming to my own views on this matter, I find myself on balance in sympathy with Senator Teague's views. I repeat `on balance' because I am perfectly well aware that there are respectable arguments in favour of this proposal-not many of them have been advanced from the Government side of the chamber, but that is another matter-just as there are very respectable arguments, in fact more respectable arguments, at this stage against it. So I find myself a good deal more in sympathy with the views expressed on this side of the chamber by Senator Teague than with the views of his other two Liberal Party senator colleagues. But the key point I wish to make is that very shortly we shall have self-government in the ACT. This Government, I think with the support of this Parliament, is proposing to impose self-government upon the ACT whether the people of the ACT want it or not. In that sense, the procedure being adopted is precisely the same as the procedure being adopted in respect of the casino proposal. Whether the people of the ACT want it or not, it will be imposed upon them by this Government and, I have to concede, by this Parliament, including the coalition parties. I make it clear in passing that I, like Senator Teague-although I express the gravest reservations about the course being adopted on this matter-will vote against the disallowance of the Ordinance. </PARA>

My only difference from Government senators is that I am expressing my view about the matter and not attempting to defend what I regard as less than wholly defensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular reason why I regard this outcome as disappointing is that, by its actions tonight, this Parliament will indicate that it simply does not trust the people of the ACT to make up their own minds on this matter. As I say, we are going to have self-government in the ACT in the very near future, and it would have seemed to me, in those circumstances, appropriate that this Parliament should mind its own business. There is no pressing requirement for Commonwealth parliamentarians to make up their minds on what is in effect a local authority issue. We could have left it for the proposed self-governing body of the ACT to come to a view upon this matter, whether in the exercise of its own authority or through what I personally would have regarded as the more appropriate course: the institution of a referendum of the people of the ACT as to whether they wanted a casino in this city, in their home town. It is highly regrettable that we have not taken that course. Nevertheless, I have indicated that I shall join my colleagues of the coalition parties in voting against the motion to disallow the Ordinance this evening. </PARA>

<PARA> What a sad society it is when as a government we have to provide entertainment on an ever more frenetic and degrading scale by providing such things as casinos. I take on board the arguments posed by Senator Sanders and Senator Stone that we seem to have an economic system such that, when there is a downturn in the building industry, we simply have to build something more. What do we do when we have built a casino? Do we build a brothel or something like that? That would be a good money spinner, too. What do we build next? We simply cannot continue until the whole countryside is covered by concrete, bricks and bitumen. At some point it must stop. We should decide sensibly when to stop that process. We should not continue to cover the countryside with buildings simply because we have a difficulty in providing employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson argued that the casino would generate wealth. The casino would generate no wealth whatsoever. I sense that the Government and the Opposition do not understand what wealth is. One cannot eat casinos, live in casinos or dress oneself in casinos. Casinos provide a means of circulating wealth which has been created elsewhere in the economy. As Senator Sanders has pointed out, that wealth is circulated mainly from those least able to afford to spend money to those who are extremely wealthy. My God, we really are a sick society. I have visited the Adelaide casino only once. It distressed me greatly when the South Australian Government saw fit to build that casino. I went there one night when Senator Jenkins visited South Australia and, because this debate was coming up, she wanted to look at the casino. It was the most depressing spectacle I have seen in a long time. The only people in that casino who were smiling were some of the croupiers. Everybody else had a desperate appearance of sadness and a desperate sense of not knowing what the hell they were there for. There was certainly no sense of pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we go in this frenetic search for artificial stimulation? What happens in casinos when we have exhausted the possibility of increasing the prize money, of providing more games for people to play? It was suggested in a very amusing but rather sick article that I read some years ago that perhaps negative prizes as well as positive prizes should be provided. Besides being able to win $10, $100, $1,000 or $250,000, which are some of the prizes that can be won, prizes might include a day in gaol or having one's left hand chopped off. The extreme prize in that scale would be winning the prize to be beheaded. Is that where society is heading? Does society need to gain cheap, artificial thrills by those sorts of mechanisms? I suggest that if that is the road on which we are travelling, we are indeed a sick society. There are a great many more productive things we could do with our money, our wealth and our ability to build things than to build casinos. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders mentioned the criminal element. Of course, it depends how one defines the criminal element. It might be defined very narrowly as those who go out as hired guns and shoot people. But it might be defined as including those people who have become extremely rich. There is a small number of people in our society who have become extremely rich under this Labor Government at the expense of the vast number of Australians who have become much poorer. In my view many of those people are criminals. At the moment in Western Australia there is the spectacle of a government which has, I believe, significantly repressed information from the Western Australian public who have been asked to subscribe large amounts of money to a number of enterprises, one of which was the Western Australian casino. I understand that the operation of the Western Australian casino was about to be investigated by the National Companies and Securities Commission. That investigation was called off because of other dealings in which the Western Australian Government was involved with those gentlemen who were concerned with the building of that casino. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the casino by its very nature will certainly attract, at the very least, those undesirable elements who will profit from a casino and who will also generate an attitude in society which certainly is not in the interests of lifting the quality of the society in which we live. If there has been an indication throughout history of the failure and dissolution of civilisation, it has been those societies which have tended to provide more of the bread and circus type of activity. That is precisely what this Government and other governments around Australia have been proposing recently. I think for these reasons we should strongly support this disallowance motion and support those people in Canberra who are, quite rightly, opposed to the establishment of a casino in this city. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to conclude this debate on my motion for the disallowance of the Casino Control Ordinance. I could have taken all the speeches delivered in the Senate this evening and used them to prove my own case. In fact, virtually every one who has spoken has given arguments against the development of a casino in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It is the perception of the Australian Democrats that the people of Canberra do not want a casino. I know that a number of polls have been conducted. As I conceded when I spoke previously-I agree with Senator McMullan-some of the polls may have been suspect. But nonetheless it is our considered opinion that the majority of people in the ACT do not want to have a casino built in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also concede that there is some division of opinion in the community, and that has also been conceded by a number of other speakers. We believe for this and other reasons-unlike the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who spoke earlier-this matter should be decided by the people who will directly represent the people of the ACT, that is, the people who will sit in the future House of Assembly of the ACT. These people will, hopefully, be responsive to the wishes of the people of the ACT. We believe it should be left to them to decide on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree with Senator McMullan that there is something intrinsically offensive about Federal parliamentarians from all over Australia deciding what is good for the people who live in the ACT. This is certainly a local matter. I am assured by the President of the ACT National Council of Women that surveys conducted in Canberra have shown that a majority of women in the ACT oppose the casino. A letter in the Canberra Times on 31 October 1988 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The casino is one obvious example, and many of us who do not particularly oppose it as such are nevertheless furious that a decision is being taken for us just a few months before we can decide it for ourselves. Mr Holding has emphasised the jobs to be created in the Section 19 development, and remarked that ``no-one has come forward'' with an alternative to the casino. But how on earth can Canberra citizens gain access now to all the relevant facts? We need elected representatives with the energy and the powers to obtain facts and consider alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Holding needs to realise that he is a caretaker; all major planning decisions must await self-government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats fully concur with those sentiments. The bureaucrats who, in the absence of a democratically elected assembly, currently really govern the Australian Capital Territory have decided that the Australian Capital Territory should have a casino. We read only recently in the Canberra Times the danger of having bureaucrats making planning decisions of that sort. The front page of the Canberra Times on Tuesday, 1 November, said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the ACT Administration's most senior executives . . . has been detached from his duties . . . business interests were incompatible with him being a senior officer of the administration. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`There is no suggestion of any impropriety and no suggestion that he has done anything wrong, but there is a possible appearance of incompatibility. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that the bureaucrats necessarily make decisions which will personally help fill their own pockets. On the other hand, it is not correct that people who are not elected and therefore not directly responsible to people who live here should be making these sorts of decisions. The decision was made originally by bureaucrats. It was then endorsed by the Australian Labor Party Cabinet and presumably by Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, because it has been in all the newspapers, and Senator Hill spoke on this, the Opposition took some time; it had meetings virtually every day this week while it made its decision. I agree with Senator Hill's statement that this is a very important issue and, as we are forcibly placed in a situation of having to make decisions on behalf of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, I agree that it is the duty of the people here to take time making that decision. It appears that the Opposition did change its mind during the week. It was placed in a position of having to decide whether to support the will of the people or the will of the developers or whoever else is pulling the strings. Some details of the debates that were held by the coalition Opposition were in the newspapers. We know that earlier in the week there were 14 speakers against the casino and three in favour. I believe, in a later debate, there were seven speakers against and two in favour of the casino. At the latest meeting, I believe that there were six speakers for and six against. It was after that meeting that the final decision was made, not as a result of a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears, therefore, that the decision was finally reached in a very strange way. I see it-and I think a lot of people in the ACT will see it-as a betrayal. It appears that the final decision was caught up in a leadership battle which is going on. There can be no greater treason than the wrong thing being done for the wrong reason. We know that the shadow Cabinet, which was in favour of it, finally won the day. This is a matter of extreme regret to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke earlier of strings being pulled, and I am not the only person to speak in this direction. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) whilst speaking in the lower House said, `Somebody up there wants a casino. ``Jump'', he says. They answer, ``How high and how soon?''.' Minister Holding said that the decision on a casino `can't wait'. There appears to be an indecent haste as far as this issue is concerned. I think this was what happened as far as the Opposition was concerned when it was making up its mind: it was caught between a rock and a hard place. It knows that most Canberrans do not want a casino. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the ACT Liberal Party also wrote an article in the Canberra Times and, unlike Mr Holding, he is unhappy about the decisions which affect the people of Canberra being made by people who live somewhere else. Even he, as a Liberal spokesperson, conceded that perhaps a majority of Canberrans are not so readily convinced of the benefits of a casino. I quote from an article in the Canberra Times on 6 October of this year by the President of the ACT Liberal Party:</PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the enduring ironies of the ACT's pre-self-government status that all the crucial decisions about our future are being made by outsiders. </PARA>
<PARA> Chief among these is the decision whether or not to build a casino in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Liberal Party, like the Canberra community in general, has been heavily divided on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Some, . . . see nothing but good flowing from a casino and believe the problems it might generate, if any, can be addressed at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Others, perhaps a majority of Canberrans, are not so readily convinced. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill has also admitted that about 50 per cent of the Canberra community will be unhappy anyway: all the more reason to allow the ACT local government assembly, which is likely to be in place in the early months of next year, to decide on the casino issue because there are a lot of issues at stake here. There is the issue of whether to have a casino or not; the location; and the whole of the section 19 development, with the theatre and the library. It is far more appropriate that an assembly to be elected, I hope democratically, by the people of the ACT should be the decision-makers on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appallingly insensitive of the Government to seek to push the casino development through by ordinance. I know we have no option because that is the way Territories are governed, but self-government is so near and an ordinance for Territories under the control of the Federal Government is not one of our most democratic legislative procedures. It reeks of the old colonial days. There is no scope for open and formalised introduction of a measure into the House and there is also no possibility of amendments or open discussion during the committee stage as we have with legislation. It is just a `take it or leave it' situation. If an ordinance is not disallowed then no debate is possible and it simply passes through unseen. </PARA>
<PARA> To impose a casino on the people of the ACT by way of ordinance, which is supported by the two bigger parties in the Senate-I exclude the National Party of Australia because it has seven senators, the same number as the Australian Democrats have-I feel is improper, especially with self-determination and self-management for the people of the ACT just around the corner. I regard that as nothing short of a political disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I gave the reasons for the Democrats' opposition to a casino in Canberra in my speech on 14 October. I think a lot of things I have said have been summed up rather nicely by other speakers in this debate. Since then there has been even more debate. There has been debate in the media on open line shows and on Pru Goward's show earlier this week, when 21 people phoned on the morning of 1 November. There were 19 against the casino and two in favour. I listened very carefully to the reasons given by the people who were against it. The main reasons were that Canberra, as our national capital, is not a suitable location for a casino and that the rationale that it will create plenty of jobs and be a great economic investment has flaws in it. They also looked at what is happening in other States in Australia. They believe it will bring undesirable influences into the city. Of the two people who rang in favour of the casino, one gave as the reason excitement; and the other, entertainment. I addressed those issues in my earlier speech so I will say no more on that score at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill raised the issue of night life. There is no casino in Melbourne or Sydney. Does that mean those cities have no night life, no excitement, no entertainment? Senator McMullan stated that we should have a legal casino, otherwise we will have an illegal one. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McMullan" NAMEID="5I4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we followed that argument, we would legalise everything. There would be no criminals at all, would there? Senator McMullan also asks the Senate to accept the economic value of the casino without our having any real details about it. I believe his argument is a spurious one. Senator Teague made a most sincere contribution and advocated that we as legislators and parliamentarians should promote family life and seek to educate people. If he was also saying that a casino is good enough for the uneducated, the disadvantaged and those without any family life, he should think again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid mentioned the old Parliament House, and I too am most concerned about what will happen to that building and the fact that the cockroaches are the only ones rushing around there. I would like to take up that issue with her later. Senator Richardson said that he could not see why the Federal Parliament should be hesitant about allowing a casino for the national capital, but a number of people believe that it is simply not appropriate. Canberra, as well as being the national capital, is home for the majority of permanent residents of the ACT. As I said before, they should have a direct input into the decision through their now assembly. Senator Richardson said there was no way to go other than the path we are now following, but let an ACT assembly be the judge of that. I can see no reason to accept that statement on trust, or the suggestion that levels of investment would trail off. </PARA>
<PARA> We also heard that the casino would induce many people to spend one extra night in Canberra, which would indeed fill the coffers. I guess we could do lots of things to persuade people to spend one extra night in Canberra. Perhaps there could be a public hanging, because I am sure people would stay an extra night to watch that. I guess that is something else that could be legalised. Just as people's opinions on gambling are divided, so are some for and some against capital punishment. It was suggested that casino gambling is no different from other forms of gambling. It is different. I think it is discriminatory for people to oppose casino gambling but not any other form of gambling, just as it is discriminatory to ban chemical weapons-a ban with which I think we would all agree-when there are other forms of weapons available. A similar analogy is our treatment of hard drugs and headache powders. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other issues were raised, including tourism. I quote a report of comments by Mr Issenberg, a director of tourism with the consultants Horwath and Horwath:</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to popular myth, Mr Issenberg said, casinos did not lure more international tourists into the market . . . With fewer locals gambling interstate, the casinos are now vying for what the trade calls `high rollers'.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the point has already been made about the building industry, but I make it as well: we cannot cover the whole continent with buildings just to provide jobs. There has to be a rationality to the building programs. The Federal Government has been in charge of the building program for Canberra, and it is a poor state of affairs for it to have left the construction workers in the lurch, as it appears has happened, and to bribe them with jobs, using the casino project as an issue, not in order. I quote also from a letter in the Canberra Times of 26 September written by the Vice-President of the ACT branch of the Society of St Vincent de Paul about the effects of the casino in Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have at least a few tourists each week who lose everything (often early in their holiday) and do not have funds with which to continue their holiday or to return home. If they have prepaid their accommodation, we help with food vouchers or we are asked to provide a bus fare to where they came from. </PARA>
<PARA>We saw in the press quite recently the story of a public servant who admitted that he had forged or falsely presented 232 cheques totalling $2.3m, most of which he used to maintain his gambling addiction in the Alice Springs casino. The cases go on. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude briefly by saying that opinion is divided. I am disappointed that when we divide now it will be along party lines. It would have been far more appropriate for there to have been a conscience vote as to a great extent it is a moral issue. I am disappointed that the major parties have not allowed their members a conscience vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of considerable importance which is particularly relevant this evening-that is, the matter of the greenhouse effect and, specifically, the contribution which nuclear energy may make to solving that problem. This is particularly relevant because tonight we have the beginning of a three-day conference in all capital cities and many lesser cities around Australia on the greenhouse problem. That conference is being organised by the Commission for the Future and tonight there will be a national television and satellite hook-up between all those cities participating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also relevant because in the newspapers in the last couple of days there have been a number of letters and articles which involve senators and in which a number of statements have been made which can be demonstrated to be completely false. For instance in today's Melbourne Age under a heading `Minister says nuclear power an option to beat greenhouse' we find that the Minister for the Arts, Sport the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . nuclear energy was an option that might have to be re-examined to counter the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA>In today's Australian Financial Review we find, under the headline `Absurd political restriction on uranium', a letter from Senator David Hamer stating:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Senator John Coulter . . . is correct in stating that we must offset the greenhouse effect through alternative and more efficient energy sources. However, he fails, in the true tradition of the Australian Democrats, to offer any viable and worthwhile solutions to a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the cause of the greenhouse effect is the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of the widespread use of fossil fuels for electric power generation. There is no reasonable likelihood of a reduction in the worldwide amount of power generated. </PARA>
<PARA>Both those statements are completely false. There is also an article in this week's Bulletin headed, `Back to the minefield', which discusses the possibility of problems within Australian Labor Party ranks over uranium mining. Again it has Senator Richardson claiming that nuclear power may well be an answer to the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons why these assertions are false and I think it is important to get them into the record. The principal among them is that the contribution which carbon dioxide is making to greenhouse warming will be approximately 50 per cent over the next 40 to 50 years. Over the next 40 to 50 years approximately 50 per cent of greenhouse warming will be generated by non-carbon dioxide gases-by a number of other gases, principally methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour and a range of gases of lower concentration, such as chlorofluorocarbons, nonetheless adding up to approximately 50 per cent of the warming. Addressing the problem of carbon dioxide through the use of nuclear energy could affect only 50 per cent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is much more pessimistic than that because, at the moment, nuclear energy can provide only electricity. Around the world only some 10 per cent to 15 per cent of energy is used as electricity. So the contribution which nuclear power could make to solving the greenhouse problem, even if the whole world were to go to nuclear power for electricity generation, would be somewhere between 5 per cent and 7 1/2 per cent. So 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent of the greenhouse problem could be addressed if the whole world shifted from coal generated electricity and electricity generated from natural gas and petroleum totally to nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other reasons why nuclear power is not a solution to the greenhouse effect. In fact, the advent of nuclear power will exacerbate the greenhouse problem. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the argument for nuclear energy was based on a continuation in the growth rate of energy consumption that had occurred in the 2 1/2 decades after the Second World War. This scenario led to wild predictions that large numbers of power stations would be built. So far these predictions have failed to materialise. But it was in these growth scenarios that the consumption of fossil fuel continued to rise along with, and to some extent because of, the advent of nuclear energy. The sixth report of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, entitled Nuclear Power and the Environment, chaired by Sir Brian Flowers, himself a commissioner of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency, looked quite specifically at whether the advent of nuclear power would reduce the consumption of fossil fuel in the developed world. It came to the conclusion, and it states this quite specifically, that the advent of nuclear power would increase the consumption of fossil fuel. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposition seems plausible but we are not convinced by it. The high demands of industrialised countries for fossil fuels will continue for many years, not least to sustain the economic growth which would be required to support large and costly nuclear programmes. We find it hard to see that nuclear development will release fossil fuels to an important extent unless-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important consideration-</PARA>
<PARA>the political will were to exist in industrialised nations to bring this about by a large re-distribution of income and this does not appear likely. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasons for that conclusion were several. Firstly, as I have already indicated, nuclear energy provides electricity only. To the extent that this electricity is used in factories in a growth-orientated economy, increasing amounts of materials must be transported to, and finished goods transported from, the factories. Transport is based on fossil fuels and will continue to be into the foreseeable future. Moreover, not all the energy-using processes in factories use electricity. Most extraction and processing which makes materials available to manufacturers is fossil fuel based-for instance, metal smelting and chemical manufacturing. Moreover, nuclear energy is capital intensive. It is particularly capital intensive at the front end. To generate this upfront capital to build nuclear power stations implies a growing economy with sufficiently rapid growth in investment capital. This is an economy which uses more fossil fuel, at the very least, while it makes the transition to nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA> In this connection it is highly significant that, in 1973 and 1974, when the price of oil went up there was not an increase in the building of nuclear power stations as we might have expected. On the contrary, with the exception of France, nuclear power station orders went into a steep decline from which they have not yet recovered. Thus, in both its development and its use nuclear power is linked to increasing fossil fuel consumption-not to decreasing fossil fuel consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, around the world electricity accounts for only about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the energy processed by man. I stress the word `processed' because a great deal is misunderstood about our use of energy. The total amount of energy used by human beings is about 99.99 per cent solar energy. We have only to consider the enormous inputs of solar energy in the growing of crops and the processes of drying those crops and in other products to realise that. In Australia, about 50 per cent of processed energy is used in transport and practically all of this is derived from liquid fossil fuels. As yet, there is no practical technology which would allow energy used in transport to be derived from nuclear sources. </PARA>
<PARA> If nuclear could substitute for fossil one would have expected an increase in nuclear power station orders following the 1973-74 oil price rise. But, as I have already mentioned, this did not happen. Nuclear power station orders were cancelled in droves. To the slight extent that oil was being used for electricity generation at that stage, there was some conversion to nuclear. However, it is clear that in the last 15 years-and there are abundant articles which attest to this fact-conservation of energy has made a far greater contribution to United States energy availability than to nuclear. For instance, in 1980 the world used energy at the rate of just under 10 terrowatts. This was made up as follows: 4.2 terrowatts from oil; 2.4 terrowatts from coal; 1.7 terrowatts from gas; 1.7 terrowatts from renewables; and 0.2 terrowatts from nuclear. In other words, we were getting about one-eighth of the amount of energy from nuclear sources as we were getting from renewable sources. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes which occurred post 1973-74 illustrate a number of things: firstly, the close linking of nuclear and economic growth with the associated growth of fossil fuel consumption-a point to which I have already referred; secondly, the inability of nuclear to substitute for fossil either technically or economically; and, thirdly, the greater contribution that can be made to energy availability and to reduction of carbon dioxide release by conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenhouse effect describes the transmission of short wave radiation from the sun, through the atmosphere, to the earth's surface and the blocking of longer wave radiation, radiating back from the earth's surface out into space. As I have indicated, there are a number of gases which contribute to this greenhouse effect, and it turns out that approximately half of the greenhouse warming is due to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide has increased from about 270 parts per million in the pre-industrial age to about 345 parts per million since industrialisation. At present, the rate of increase of carbon dioxide is approximately half a per cent per year. Nitrous oxide is increasing in the atmosphere at approximately 0.6 per cent per year-substantially faster than carbon dioxide. Some of this arises from fossil fuel combustion, but substantial amounts come from the use of nitrogen fertilisers and the clearing of forests. Atmosphere methane is increasing at 1.1 per cent per annum-more than twice as fast as carbon dioxide. The principal sources of this are ruminant animals, rice paddies and extensive areas of water-covered and anaerobic soils. The increase in atmospheric methane has closely paralleled world population growth over the last 600 years, and there are very good statistics on this from ice core samples. The two freons which we debated at some length this afternoon-freon 11 and freon 12-are increasing at between five and seven per cent per annum. They are some 10,000 times more effective as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The only reason that carbon dioxide overshadows them is that it is present in much higher concentration. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in all these gases is arising from population and economic growth-more people demanding more from a finite earth. This pattern of population growth plus economic growth is being promoted by precisely the same people-we have many of them in this chamber-and interests that are promoting nuclear energy. If this growth model continues to be pursued, the greenhouse problem can only get worse. It will become more intractable and these serious consequences will become inevitable. Nuclear power will do little to mitigate this problem and it is likely to exacerbate it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the alternative conserver society model which is proposed by the Australian Democrats, nuclear energy is unnecessary. Much more efficient use of energy is readily achievable, and that has been demonstrated in a number of countries, given the political will. I point to the figures for Australia, the United States and China because it is often argued-I think Senator Hamer argues-that Third World countries do not have an option but to increase their consumption of energy. China uses energy at about one-quarter the efficiency of Japan. For instance, China uses 40.9 megajoules of energy per dollar value added, compared with only 19.3 megajoules in the United States and 9.7 megajoules per dollar value added in Japan. So there is enormous scope, even in countries like Japan, to increase availability of energy by going down the road to greater efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The final argument that I think is worth stressing is that in considering alternative paths to a solution to a problem-and here we are considering alternative paths to a solution to the greenhouse problem-we need to look at comparing those paths which will be most efficient, in other words, give the best return-in this case the greatest reduction in carbon dioxide addition to the atmosphere-for a given investment. A recent study carried out in the United States looked at the capital and running costs of nuclear energy and compared the costs of implementing increased efficiency programs. The figures work out like this: increasing the efficiency of use of electricity is seven times more productive in terms of cost than building nuclear power stations; seven times more effective for efficiency improvements compared with nuclear power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> What that means in dollar terms is that for every $100 invested in nuclear power that could have been spent on improvements in efficiency, an extra tonne of carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere. In other words, pursuing nuclear energy as a solution to greenhouse again increases the problems of greenhouse rather than decreases it. I point out that this very thorough study used extremely favourable costing for nuclear power and yet even so showed that with a greatly accelerated program of nuclear power station building-that is, of 1,000 megawatts every 1.6 days and the expenditure of $787 billion each year, representing a 29-fold worldwide expansion over the next 40 years-greenhouse warming would only be ameliorated by between 20 and 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these very sound reasons, nuclear power is not a solution to greenhouse and attempting to argue for nuclear power in this way is extremely counterproductive because it diverts attention from those areas to which we should be giving our greatest attention, namely, improvements in efficiency. On the contrary, the argument for adopting nuclear power is predicated on assumptions, all of which will make the greenhouse problem worse. The one lesson we should have learnt by now, not least from the major global greenhouse weather shift, is that attempting to apply technical solutions to what are basically social, political and economic problems usually compounds these problems and makes them even more intractable. </PARA>

Not only are they infesting the inside of the House; they are clearly infesting the ceilings, and the outside is now a sight to behold. I assume that there is no suggestion that they should not be sprayed because of some bizarre opposition by the Australian Democrats or some other quaint and curious party who have an objection to the use of insecticides or chemicals of any type in sprays.

<PARA> Following a visit yesterday by Mr Ted Edwards and myself, we wish to make the following observations. As discussed, the moths are migrating through Canberra from their breeding grounds in NSW and south Qld to the `summer-sleeping' . . . areas in the mountains in southern NSW and Victoria. They are trapped on the Parliament House building by the strong lights on the building. Since the lights on and inside the building are switched on all night and the moths do not fly during the day, they cannot leave the building. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We suggested that reduction of building lights is the solution; the best would be if all or almost all lights could be switched off during the last half of the night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was distracted, Mr President. I was just wiping a moth off my sleeve. Whatever you can do about the moths, I am sure we will all appreciate it. My office is one that is becoming most difficult to work in but the chamber has become much worse in the last 24 hours and we will have to do something about it pretty soon. We really cannot go on like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note the comments of Senator Coulter. Certainly energy conservation is a far better alternative than nuclear power or, indeed, any other form of energy, and I would hope that we can go along that path. However, it is not the only solution. We will need more than simply conserving energy. That may get us through some years; it certainly will not get us through 50 or 100 years. We will have to tackle the energy needs of the future, and I can only repeat what I said today; I hope nuclear energy is the last resort, but I find it difficult simply to rule it out as one of the options for a future generation. </PARA>

<PARA> The following SES positions were created-six Level 1, three Level 2.</PARA>

<PARA> In relation to administrative service officer positions, a single classification structure was introduced into the Public Service in December 1987.
