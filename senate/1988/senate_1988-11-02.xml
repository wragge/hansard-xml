<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Drugs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them, for cost saving reasons only, on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra Bureaucrat, and;</PARA>
<PARA>that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senators in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to immediately abandon the proposal and keep its election promise of high quality and universal health care for all Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>In-vitro Fertilisation Patients: Medicare Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in-vitro-fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro-fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility.</PARA>

<PARA>The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That it be recognised the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill is a public, legal acknowledgement that Australians who are non-aboriginal do not have sovereignty in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the Australian people are opposed to the idea of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Australian people who are non-aboriginal and those who are aboriginal, and the Government has no mandate or authority to pursue it.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the proposed legislation and treaty</PARA>
<PARA> will damage Australia's position under international law and in any conflict,</PARA>
<PARA> will cause distrust and conflict between our aboriginal population (1%) and the non-aboriginal population (99%),</PARA>
<PARA> will extend aboriginal land rights, contrary to the wishes of the Australian people,</PARA>

<PARA> But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20,000 years old archaeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed, like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So much has been misreported about my domestic circumstances in the last few days that I think I must use this forum to set the record straight. First, let me state quite clearly and unequivocally that I have never been an applicant for public housing. Like many other tenants on the Glebe Estate, I am there as an historical anomaly. If the church had not sold its property in 1975, I would not be the subject of vicious attacks by the New South Wales Government today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is understandable that there should be considerable resentment towards a senator occupying a Housing Commission home. I am, of course, not the only one. That housing is a major crisis in contemporary Australian society is an indictment of our governments. When I first went to live in the Glebe Estate 20 years ago it was as a student and I was a private tenant of the Anglican Church. The housing was substandard, the rents were low, but it was an interesting community of students and locals. In 1975, the Church sold the Estate of 600 dwellings to the Whitlam Government, which established the Estate for public housing, as distinct from welfare housing. Tom Uren, then Minister for Urban and Regional Development and author of the Estate, intended that the Estate should contain a social mix of workers, professionals and those on social security of one kind or another. The idea was to establish a viable community, and that has proven to be a successful social experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with many other residents, did not welcome the news that the Federal Government had transferred the Estate to the New South Wales Housing Commission in 1985. Nonetheless, I remained on the Estate because the quality of the housing did not concern me that much, and the rent certainly suited a freelance editor, film-maker and political activist. I was not making a great deal of money. I had no assets, but I did make some good films and contributed my labours freely to what I believed were worthwhile projects, including a campaign to free three men unjustly convicted of a crime they did not commit. The films won prizes and the men were released from jail. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 18 months ago my circumstances changed and I entered full-time employment. I informed the Housing Commission and paid the full rent for my flat as assessed by the Commission. I repeat: I was not a public housing applicant; never. I spent money on renovating the flat, which had not been touched for 10 years by the Commission or the Federal Government. And I did not move. It did not, quite frankly, occur to me to move. I regarded that place as my home and I was prepared to pay the rents set by the landlord. Similarly, when I became a senator just a mere two months ago I would not have considered moving from the place I regarded as home even if I had had time to think about it. Call this naivety, but call it no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the New South Wales Minister for Housing, Joe Schipp, has tried to blame me for the problems of the homeless in New South Wales when his Government is decimating public housing in the inner city areas of Sydney by selling off Mort Bay, the Raleigh Park Estate at Kensington, the Crown Street Women's Hospital site and others, which in all would provide homes for 2,000 families. If Mr Schipp is so concerned about the homeless, why does he not give over a room in his house to some homeless person, and ask his mates in government to do the same? If Mr Schipp tries to evict me--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that, Mr President. If Mr Schipp tries to evict me, it is clear that he will also have to evict 22,000 other people. Yesterday he increased my rent by 160 per cent. This means I will be paying $200 a week for a run-down, one bedroom flat in Glebe. He backdated payments to July. By contrast, other well-off tenants will now be asked to pay a 50 per cent increase from next April. It is clear that he is penalising me for the poor management and inefficiencies of the Commission. Let me conclude by saying that Mr Schipp has stirred up a hornet's nest with the housing issue and he may well get stung.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Since the deregulation of the industry at the beginning of 1988, oil producers have proven to be quick to develop new markets and innovative marketing techniques. In this way they have been able to maximise the value of their output, both to themselves and the nation. However, as a result of these developments certain types of crude oil transactions have occurred which are not strictly covered by the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987, since these transactions were not envisaged when the Act was passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of this Bill, which is largely of a technical nature, is to amend the 1987 Act to provide the Minister with additional powers to fix, for the purpose of excise determination, prices for certain types of crude oil transactions. Such transactions include sales where a quantity of crude oil is disposed of either by exchange, having the oil converted to products which are then sold or by any means other than direct sale for example, by barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth excise on crude oil production is estimated at $1.4 million in 1988-89. This bill is essential to ensure that excise on the transactions described is assessed on a fair and accurate basis. In addition, the Bill will allow crude oil producers the greatest possible flexibility in the use of marketing techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to give effect to the Government's decision announced as part of the May 1988 economic statement to remove the exemption from liability for excise duty presently afforded to government business enterprises, and to incorporate into that Act various excise tariff proposals tabled in this Parliament during the last sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Removal of Excise Duty Exemption from Government Business Enterprises</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendment relating to government business enterprises removes from 1 July 1989 the exemption from liability for excise duty on goods which are used by those agencies and budget-funded authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the exemption from liability for customs duty on goods imported by these bodies was removed as a result of the Government's decision in the May 1987 economic statement. It is the intention of this Bill that all such Commonwealth agencies which are now liable for customs duty on their imports will also be liable for excise duty from 1 July 1989 on domestically produced excisable goods which they use. </PARA>
<PARA> Government business enterprises which are currently subject to customs duties but exempt from excise duties include Telecom and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment in clause 5 of this Bill will rectify the anomalous situation whereby goods acquired by these and other like agencies can attract different indirect tax treatment depending on whether they are imported or produced domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of these excise exemptions is consistent with the Government's moves to improve the efficiency of government business enterprises by placing them on a more commercial footing. The May 1988 economic statement endorsed the general principle that these enterprises should be exposed to the same taxes and charges as private businesses. In line with this endorsement the timing of the removal of a number of remaining tax exemptions attracted by government business enterprises, including excise duty, was announced in the May 1988 economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that by-laws will be made under the Excise Act 1901 prescribing an identical list of exempt agencies in relation to excise duty as has been promulgated for customs duty by by-laws made under the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the Government's LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is based on the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now only applies to offshore fields-that is, Bass Strait. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 April 1988, from $13.21 to $15.39 a kilolitre, an increase of $2.18 from the previous rate set on 1 October 1987. The increase reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG over the six months to March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Aviation Kerosene-Avtur</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will remove the excise duty on aviation kerosene with effect from 1 July 1988, by reducing the rate of excise from $0.16087 per litre to zero. This adjustment stems from the Government's decision in the May 1988 economic statement to discontinue the excise on aviation kerosene and substitute an enroute charge levied by the Civil Aviation Authority. The authority commenced levying the charge on 1 July 1988, the same day the excise was discontinued. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure gives partial effect to the funding element of the Government's decision to transfer the functional responsibility for the provision of air traffic control, flight advisory services, communications, navigation and surveillance systems and rescue and firefighting services to the Civil Aviation Authority. Hitherto, revenue from excise tariff duties on aviation kerosene have been attributed to the aviation industry for cost recovery purposes. For purposes of aviation cost recovery calculations, aviation fuel excise revenues had generally been set against the cost of providing airways enroute facilities and services and system overhead costs. </PARA>
<PARA> With the transfer to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the responsibility for the provision of airways enroute facilities and services from 1 July 1988, the Government reviewed the funding arrangements for the new authority and decided that the CAA would introduce domestic enroute charges for its services in place of budget revenues from excise duties on aviation kerosene and departure tax. Clause 4 of this Bill therefore abolishes excise duties on avtur in accordance with those arrangements. These changed arrangements ensure that the CAA is fully responsible and accountable for the provision and pricing of its commercial airways services. The new enroute charges of that authority represent a more appropriate and efficient user-pays basis for these services. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (a) Government business enterprises-removal of excise exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no direct financial implications for the 1988-89 year, as the measure does not come into operation until 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional excise receipts in 1989-90 are estimated at $25 million. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Liquefied petroleum gas:</PARA>
<PARA> The 1 April 1988 increase in the excise rate for naturally occurring LPG is estimated to result in an increase of $3.4 million in excise receipts in 1988-89;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Aviation kerosene (Avtur)</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the excise duty on aviation kerosene will result in a decrease in excise revenue of $190 million in the 1988-89 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the determination of the Pathology Services Table contained in Determination PST2/1988 and made under section 4a of the Health Insurance Act 1973, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>We come before the Senate to examine once again changes in Government health policy and, in particular, the financing of health services. The Government has demonstrated an incapacity to manage the financial aspects of its medical and health policies in a competent fashion. In October 1987 the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC) was established. Its brief was to provide for a more rapid and flexible procedure for reviewing and revising the pathology services table and the associated fees for Medicare rebate purposes. However, there was an unusual element to the way in which the PSAC was established and given its authority. That unusual element was that when it made recommendations to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), the Minister had the choice simply to accept the recommendations in total or to reject them in total. He did not have available a discretion to vary the recommendations or, indeed, a discretion to accept some and reject others. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 July 1988 the Pathology Services Advisory Committee made and forwarded recommendations to the Minister for Community Services and Health about the pathology services table and associated fees for Medicare benefit purposes. The motivation behind the PSAC review which resulted in the recommendations was to rationalise the pathology services table. The published PSAC recommendation states in paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7:</PARA>
<PARA>The recommended table represents an attempt to deal with all the identified problems in a manner which also provides incentives for pathology providers and referees to be more thoughtful about the way they order pathology and use the pathology services table . . . The recommended table is designed to eliminate the necessity for repetition of item numbers within single patient encounters. </PARA>
<PARA>That may be all very well, but the recommendations and the scale of fees attached have led to a potentially disastrous situation for the providers of pathology services, both in the private and public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I will examine briefly the recommendations of the Advisory Committee in regard to the financial impact of its proposals. I turn to the statement of reasons by the Committee for the recommendation dated 31 July 1988, which was made under section 78c (1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Page 12 of the Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The basis upon which fees have been fixed in the recommended Table is in conformity with an objective that the total Medicare benefit cost not be increased as a result of the revision undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> An effect of the recommended changes to both items and fees has been that it has not been possible to calculate the cost impact of the recommended table. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee then goes on to say subsequently:</PARA>
<PARA>Consideration was given to the preparation of a statistical model of incidence of items and benefits payments. This proved to be impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on page 13 of the report the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>When a similar exercise, that is to say essentially a modelling exercise, was attempted within some private practices variable results were obtained due to differing tests combinations. An overall reduction of 5 to 8 per cent was found but the statistical sampling was not large or widespread enough to give clear indications in respect to the true financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>There are three elements that arise from that analysis of the financial impact statement contained within the Committee's report: firstly, that the provisions would be revenue neutral-that is to say that they would not significantly vary the overall cost to the Medicare system; secondly, that it had not been found possible by the Committee to undertake a modelling procedure which would allow it to make a calculation on best available evidence of the impact of these changes on pathology services provided in either the public or private sector; and thirdly, that using such techniques as were available to it and as were considered appropriate by the Committee, it was believed that an overall reduction in the order of 5 to 8 per cent would be achieved in terms of the Medicare rebate payments and thereby indirectly in terms of the rebates and income available to the pathology practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> This figure gained some degree of credence. It was used as the basis of statements made on behalf of the Minister for Community Services and Health and indeed, the Budget Papers contain an indication that it was expected that something in the order of $11m would be saved by these moves, that representing about a 2.2 per cent reduction in overall costs of pathology services. We have, quite clearly, an acceptance of that round figure of 5 per cent or so both by the Committee and by spokesmen on behalf of the Minister. That is reflected in the Budget Papers which were presented just a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when one undertakes a detailed examination of the proposed changes, one sees that 5 to 8 per cent becomes absolutely impossible to sustain. It is quite clear that the loss which will be suffered by practitioners in the private pathology sector could be in the order of 15 to 20 per cent and, in the public pathology sector, up to 30 per cent. What happened was that those who were most directly concerned with this determination-they included the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices (AAPP)-undertook a modelling exercise. Their modelling exercise was verified by Coopers and Lybrand W. D. Scott and the Department of Community Services and Health. Their model indicated quite clearly that the adoption of the new scale of fees would result in reductions of private pathology incomes of 15 to 20 per cent and reductions of public pathology incomes of up to 30 per cent. This is late in the day. The new schedule of fees is due to commence today. One of the difficulties that have been encountered is that, despite the repeated requests made by both the Royal College and the Association of Pathology Practices to the Minister for some deferral of the commencement of these arrangements, such a deferral has not been possible, or has not been conceded as being possible by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that the scale of fees which was proposed is inappropriate. It understands that it is facing a major problem in this regard. In a press statement by the Chairperson of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, His Honour Mr Justice Munro, dated 20 September 1988, he indicates that a full review of the Medicare pathology services table will be undertaken immediately and that this follows the interim revision of the table recently completed and now put into effect and subject to this disallowance motion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clearly recognised by most people in the field that this scale of fees will have the impact which I have mentioned and is likely to be extremely threatening to the continuation of pathology services, particularly those in the private sector. An article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 21 October 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA>A `revenue neutral' decision to halve the number of items on Medicare's pathology schedule has threatened the financial viability of public and private practices and unwittingly saved the Federal Government $100m. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to detail the sort of information which I have put to the Senate this morning. It is quite clear that there is a widespread acceptance of the fact that this schedule is inappropriate. For a number of private practitioners it will be a fatal blow to the continuation of their practices. It will not simply be those in the private sector who will be affected. A number of people in the public sector also will be affected. I intend to refer to a couple of matters in that regard. Firstly, I will give an example of the impact which this change of fees will have on one pathology service. I refer to the pathology service which takes place at the Taylor Square Private Clinic in Sydney. The Taylor Square Private Clinic, which is run by Dr Basil Donovan, who is the President of the Venereology Association of Australia and one of the most eminent practitioners in the field of venereology and sexually transmitted disease management and indeed, in terms of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, provides a pathology service which is likely to be destroyed if this scale of fees is allowed to continue. Dr Donovan wrote to the Minister for Community Services and Health on 1 October 1988, and I propose to read his letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Dr Blewett</PARA>
<PARA>* * *</PARA>
<PARA> I have to appeal to you in the strongest terms to defer the above measures. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, the rebate system to be introduced on 1 November. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This Clinic could not survive the resultant 32% drop in gross practice income, including a 60% drop in the rebate for standard sexually transmissible disease . . . testing: we are already at the limit of our working overdraft. In part this is because of the change in practice profile due to a longstanding commitment to AIDS prevention and treatment, and also as a result of other reductions (in the recent past) to Medicare rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of closure of this Clinic would be the loss of this state's only recognisable private consultancy service for the referral of complicated STDs and the abandonment of the 600-700 AIDS and HIV antibody positive patients who receive regular monitoring and management of intercurrent medical problems (including terminal care) through the Clinic. I can only predict that this would cause considerable distress to our clientele, be detrimental to the public health and directly cost the public purse more money as these people would be managed much more expensively in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As our regular clientele becomes increasingly unwell, and go onto sickness benefits or invalid pensions, we find that over 50% of visits are now bulk-billed. The personal income of the doctors in this Clinic are now well below those of our counterparts in the public clinics. Some of our counterparts in the United States, who were pioneers in the description of the AIDS epidemic, have been bankrupted by their involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> If our situation sounds strange it is because, in contrast to Britain and New Zealand, STD medicine (or Venereology) is not a recognised medical speciality in Australia. While we function as specialists, with all of the ensuing practice overheads, we do not receive similar remuneration. The Clinic has to be `propped up' by a pathology service for both economic and quality control reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Our selective use of the service however provides economies for Medicare and supports the salaries of our specialist STD nurse counsellors and the maintenance of clinical skills, infection control practices, inner city commercial rentals, etc, forced on us by our major involvement in HIV medicine. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Donovan concludes his letter by drawing the attention of the Minister to an article published in the Medical Journal of Australia about the clinic's outstanding record, and record of success, in the management of patients with HIV infection. That is simply one example of a small but important clinic in Sydney whose work will be destroyed, whose financial viability will be destroyed, and whose long term continuation will be made impossible if this scale of fees is allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of New South Wales is particularly concerned about this matter. On 31 October the Hon. Peter Collins, the Minister for Health in New South Wales, wrote to Dr David Kindon, the Secretary of the Australian Association of Pathology Practices. Minister Collins says in his letter, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted your concerns, many of which are shared by the Department of Health, NSW, and a number of public hospitals in the state. You may be interested to know that the Secretary of the Department of Health, NSW, wrote to his counterpart in the Commonwealth on 20th October 1988 to express misgivings about fee levels in the Schedule and the timetable for its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the potential reduction in fee revenue flowing from the new Schedule, the Department is extremely concerned about the limited time available to adjust hospitals' computer billing programs (less than 5 weeks). In addition, the presence of definitions that are unclear, the application of special conditions, (e.g. time limits on tests) and the existence of several anomalies in the interim Schedule, combine to create a complex new charging system. The Department's Information Service Division has estimated that it will take at least 2 months to alter the current hospital billing programs to implement the new Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the NSW Government supports measures that are designed to remove abuses of Medicare, such measures should not financially penalise the legitimate and high quality work performed by this State's hospital-based Group Pathology Services. Accordingly, I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Dr. Blewett. I have requested that he defer the introduction of the new Schedule until discussions can be completed on its interpretation and until the administrative machinery for its implementation can be finalised. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Collins is making the same point, on behalf of the group pathology services which operate within the New South Wales public hospital system, as the point which was made by Dr Donovan and by others in regard to private pathology services. What we have is a whole series, once again, of what might be referred to as unintended consequences. Unfortunately, that is somewhat typical of the way in which the Government manages its cost cutting exercises within the health sector. The new rules are complex, they are difficult to administer, and they are in no way capable of being able to gauge accurately the appropriate level of patient rebate. Some of the rebates will in fact be cut quite substantially. For instance, in the case of some immunology services, the reduction is to be in the order of 50 per cent. As I said, this is another example of the Hawke Labor Government's approach to cost cutting within medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will undoubtedly recall that we had a lengthy debate over a couple of days in this place about the disallowance of certain regulations made in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). I, in fact, moved on behalf of the Opposition for the disallowance of the new regulations which would have removed 53 drugs from the PBS schedule and would have put them into a system whereby special authority had to be obtained for their prescription. The Government resisted that move and, with the support of the Australian Democrats, defeated it. That was just a couple of weeks ago. However, within a week or 10 days of that matter being discussed here in Parliament the Government has backtracked and 34 of the 53 drugs, which were the essence of that debate, have now been deleted from the authority system and put back into the situation in which we claim all of the 53 drugs should have been left. That, of course, took place because there was once again a review. The Government undertook on that occasion through the work of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee a re-examination of an earlier determination and ended up scrapping most of the determination. </PARA>
<PARA> We see once again that there is to be yet a further review by the Pathology Services Advisory Committee of its initial determination, which is the cause of this disallowance motion. That Committee is to meet again next Friday. It is to review once again the determination in light of all the evidence that has been put before it; the evidence that far from being a 5 to 8 per cent reduction in rebates to pathologists we are talking about anything between 15 and 30 per cent, that it has got the figures wrong, that it has introduced a system which is extraordinarily complicated in an administrative sense in which the groupings of items do not appear to be coherent to those who are most concerned and do not appear to be entirely coherent in the view of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Government is going back to the drawing board. We are saying that this determination, should be disallowed now. Instead of making adjustments from an unsatisfactory position, the current position should be maintained until the new review has looked at all the issues and determined a more appropriate scale of rebates, a more appropriate scale of fees, a more appropriate definition of the items to be covered, of the item numbers and of the groupings of items which are to be provided on the records which will be put forward for rebate purposes. In a press statement issued yesterday the shadow Minister for health, my colleague the honourable member for Tangney, Peter Shack, put forward the Opposition's view in these words:</PARA>
<PARA>In short, the Government has made a huge mistake and the financial impact of the new schedule is far more serious than is intended, or the pathologists were led to expect. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but the Government has admitted its mistake yet is refusing to delay the implementation of the new schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> This attitude is totally consistent with the Government's belligerent stance towards doctors and pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also in keeping with its cost containment measures currently affecting Medicare rebates for medical services and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> Calls by the RCPA and the AAPP for the Government to defer the introduction of the new schedule pending its restructuring and re-costing have fallen on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA> By moving for the disallowance of the Interim Schedule the Opposition is seeking to buy breathing space both for patients who could face extra out of pocket expenses, and for pathology practices threatened with bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of seeing that patients receive the first class pathology services to which they are entitled the Government must not only admit its mistake, but be willing to go back to the drawing board. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a case of gaps between pathology fees and Medicare rebates resulting from pathologists lifting their charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the Government is creating a gap by withdrawing rebates to the detriment of the provision of effective diagnostic services. Under this schedule there are a number of serious anomalies such as in clinical microbiology where blood culture test rebates will barely cover the cost of culture media for patients with septicaemia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the investigation of suspected endocartisis, for example, multiple samples of blood must be collected on sequential days. </PARA>
<PARA> But the economic imperatives of the new schedule would be to minimise the number of samples and the use of culture media. </PARA>
<PARA> These are just a couple of examples of other undesirable features of the schedule which could be directly prejudicial to good patient care. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government has any commitment at all to seeing the delivery of quality health care it must delay the introduction of the new schedule and address the many serious issues which it raises. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the statement of the Opposition's position on this particular matter. We believe that the Government has made a serious mistake. We accept that the Minister for Health had no alternative but to either accept or reject the recommendations of the Committee in toto. We accept that the Committee itself will undertake some revision of this particular matter. We believe that that should take place from the existing position which applied prior to yesterday rather than from the position of the introduction of the new determination which in fact commences today. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say that the issues are indeed extremely complicated. May I also concede that there is a need within the health services to minimise the costs in areas such as pathology and pharmaceuticals. Indeed, within the pathology section in particular there is a need to eliminate a number of undesirable practices and rorts, some of which border on the criminal. People will recall that some years ago I spent an hour or so of the Senate's time discussing the affairs of Dr Edelsten, his clinics and the misuse of pathology services for which he was responsible and which were the subject of an investigation by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts under the chairmanship of former Senator Georges. A number of matters including criminal charges flowed from that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage the Australian Democrats are minded to support the Opposition's move to disallow these regulations. We draw attention again to the two unsatisfactory aspects of the way in which regulations come into existence; namely, that very often they have an effect before the disallowance can be properly debated and, secondly, that one cannot pick and choose in relation to regulations-one has either to disallow in toto or to allow in toto. These matters have put us in a situation in which the schedule will come into existence. As Senator Puplick has pointed out, not only does this involve a change in the fee structure against code numbers which remain unchanged but in this case there is a change in the whole schedule so that pathologists' offices will have to completely reprogram their computers to work to the proposed new fee structure. So the actual cost of the transition from the old structure to the new structure is quite considerable and the conversion back again, should this fee structure come into existence, is again going to be an expensive operation. The sooner this matter is sorted out the better, and for that reason we are minded to bring this matter to a vote quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Puplick indicated in his closing remarks, in the past vast profits have been made in the pathology area of medicine. As one who worked for many years as a pathologist-not in a laboratory providing routine services but in a research capacity, although nonetheless associated with pathologists providing those sorts of services-I know that in the late 1960s and early 1970s when pathology moved from the hand-type laboratory tests, where one used beakers and pipettes and so on, over to the automated tests in which first four, then eight, then 12 and then 24 tests were done on a single sample, the fee schedules remained locked into the earlier methods of conducting these tests and pathologists were really making enormous incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I had friends who went into private pathology who very quickly were working three and four-day weeks because they were embarrassed by the size of their tax bill. That seems now to be well and truly in the past. Pathologists' reimbursements under the schedule of fees have been brought more into line with the actual costs of conducting these tests, and the new schedule would seem to indicate, on the best available evidence, that the reimbursements to pathologists would fall by somewhere between 15 per cent and 18 per cent in an industry which is now, as far as one can judge, well run and, to use the Government's jargon, very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> One other aspect of these regulations which concerns us is the need for a wide ranging review of the provision of medical services generally in this country. We have recently had a debate on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) schedule. In that instance we supported the Government's moves to remove certain drugs from the PBS schedule, but in the course of that debate we pointed out, as did the Opposition, the need for a very wide ranging review of the nature of the medical services and the need to shift the emphasis in those medical services from treatment towards prevention. Immediately after the conclusion of that debate on the disallowance motion on the PBS, we introduced a motion, which unfortunately was not supported by the Opposition, calling for a wide ranging review of the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were to pick up that principle in relation to pathology services-this bears very much on a matter which Senator McLean has raised several times in recent days in the Senate-provision would be made for tests which were carried out by those doctors who were pursuing less usual causes of illness, causes related to potential environmental contamination, stress, obscure sensitivity to environmental agents, particularly toxic agents and the like, some of whom, as we have heard in questions in this place, have been denied the ability to claim reimbursement for those tests. All these matters, I believe, should be thrown back into the melting pot, particularly in view of the increasing cost of the provision of medical services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think other senators will have had the experience of being continually exposed to lobbying from groups seeking reimbursement for tests for treatments and the like carried out at vast expense to the public for extremely limited benefit. As a community, and I have made this point before, we should be addressing this problem. We should be opening up to public debate the question of what sorts of medical services we want as a community, how much we are prepared to pay, and how we get the greatest long term benefit to the community for the dollars we spend. I believe a review like that would clearly indicate that an emphasis on the preventive aspects of medicine would be far more beneficial than the present very great emphasis on expenditure on the treatment of those who have already become ill. I think the small amount which is spent on anti-tobacco advertising, for instance, produces a far greater benefit than the treatment of those people who have become ill because of smoking, particularly those who go on to develop malignancy. The cost of those pathology tests spread out over many years is vast indeed. I believe a substantial shift in funds into those preventive areas would see not only a healthier community but also a reduction in the overall costs of medical care in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We simply cannot go on spending more and more money in the medical area. It is a larger and larger percentage of gross national product each year. No doubt the reason that the Government has attempted to reschedule the fee structure for pathologists is related to that issue, as was the restructuring of the schedule for the PBS. However, these things are being done in isolation. They are being done as individual packages. What really is required is a total review, which must necessarily involve the public, of the costs of medical care; of the ways in which we can spend our health care dollar to provide the greatest benefit. Recognising that this set of regulations in relation to the pathology schedule involves a vast and expensive rescheduling of the computers in pathologists' offices, we believe that the sooner this matter is finalised and brought to a vote the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening I reminded the Senate that, despite promises by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in July last year that there would be no further cuts to Tasmania, my State has lost nearly $30m from the revenue grant, which was equal to a real cut of 5.2 per cent. I also remind the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) that the Federal Government has more than doubled the global limit on borrowing and at the same time has reduced State borrowing limits. In fact, the Government has increased the limit for its own authorities in this year by $1,452m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to two apparent inconsistencies in the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill. Last evening the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) said that he had received legal advice that the definition of a State instrumentality includes a body corporate and as an instrumentality of the State would not include State banks and financial institutions of the State. If it were not the intention to include such institutions as such, why was the definition changed? Was the Minister aware that had those institutions been included in the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill it would have effectively subverted the intention of the Loan Council? Is that correct? I wish to point to a further inconsistency and refer to the interpretation of the definition of `new borrowings'. It appears that the global borrowings will now be made up of both general purpose capital assistance-that is Loan Council borrowings-and also global borrowings. I remind the Minister that this has not previously been the case. Will he please confirm that global borrowings to the States have been reduced?</PARA>
<PARA> I go on to provide further support for this proposition by stating that financial assistance to which a State is entitled under this Act is granted on condition that the State will not allow the sum of its new borrowings and the new borrowings of State instrumentalities to exceed the global borrowing limits for the State. I remind the Minister that the Bill interprets new borrowings as being an amount of borrowing that is received in the grant year, but does not include an amount of borrowing for the purpose of refinancing debt outstanding at 30 June 1988. Does it follow that the Bill does not preclude the loan component of general purpose revenue capital assistance from being classified as `new borrowings'? Is it therefore the case that the global borrowing limit will be made up of both general purpose capital assistance-that is Loan Council borrowings-and global borrowings? If it is the Government's wish that the full global borrowing limit is maintained, surely it is necessary to change the definition. Could the Minister please answer those five questions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address one of the areas. I am advised that the clause does not give the Treasurer (Mr Keating) unfettered discretion to decide whether a State's borrowings or those of its instrumentalities are excessive. The Treasurer would be bound to determine what constitutes excessive borrowings in accordance with arrangements agreed with the States. In other words, he can only enforce the terms of the global approach resolution of the Loan Council as accepted by all States-except Queensland, which went off on a frolic of its own after the Premiers Conference. The resolution defines in detail what represents a borrowing, subject to the global limits. The Acting Treasurer wrote to the Premiers recently to reassure them on this specific point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a question to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) concerning State finances, and particularly those of South Australia and Western Australia. Recently, on 12 October, the Premier of South Australia indicated in the South Australian Parliament that there had been a rearrangement of the funding of some $25m which was due by the Commonwealth to the State of South Australia. The rearrangement was on the basis that that would temporarily be paid to the State of Western Australia in place of my own State of South Australia, and that somehow this was normal practice for the Commonwealth. He went on to say that it had occurred in other States from time to time where annual revenue grants payable to the States when not required had been transferred to other States for their more or less temporary use, as I understand the position. This comes as a bit of a shock to those of us who thought that when we pass a Budget and allocations are made that is the State to which payment will be made. However, we now find that there is jiggery-pokery between the various States when it suits the Commonwealth and when it suits the electoral demands of individual States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clear implication from the payment of $25m to Western Australia that was supposed to have gone to South Australia is that it ended up in Western Australia, which is about to face an election, in order to meet some shortfall in that State's budget. This becomes even more important and requires an answer from the Minister in light of recent events. I refer to the Western Australian Government's involvement in propping up the Rothwells Ltd bank. Of course, it is no longer a bank and its shares are no longer being traded on the stock exchange. I also refer to some of the other interestingly creative business ventures in which the Western Australian Government has become involved in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> My question to the Minister is this: Is it usual practice for one State to arrange for the payment of loan moneys that would otherwise be paid through the general revenue grants system by the Commonwealth to a State to be changed in such a way that they are payable to other States when one State finds that it is not in need of that money? In this case, as I indicated, the amount involved was $25m. This was confirmed by the Premier of South Australia in the South Australian Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a continuing misunderstanding that this legislation has anything to do with capital grants. This legislation has nothing to do with capital grants. It concerns financial assistance grants and borrowing limits. Capital grants are moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth-we should ignore the fact that the Commonwealth this year is not a net borrower-money notionally borrowed by the Commonwealth and handed on as loans to the States to be repaid over varying periods. That has nothing to do with this legislation. The point that Senator Messner was making when I entered the chamber shows that he misunderstands the matter. The $25m to which he referred is relevant to the global limits of borrowing and not to the Commonwealth grants per se. I referred to this matter in the paragraph that I read out yesterday.

This advice is subject to confirmation or otherwise from the Treasury official, but it seems to me that, conceptually, the State Bank is borrowing every time someone lodges a deposit with it. Therefore, it does not seem to me that these global limits would apply to a State bank in those circumstances. I am advised that the definition in the legislation does include financial intermediaries because there is no way to distinguish financial institutions in law. The key factor is that the Treasurer is bound by the global approach and therefore it must exclude borrowings by financial institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>

The general purpose capital assistance is money provided from the Commonwealth Budget to the States in the form of loans repayable over variable periods of time. In fact it might be a fixed period of time, but in any case it is repayable over quite a long time. It is actually a direct Commonwealth Budget outlay. Of course there are direct Commonwealth Budget outlays in this legislation too, because of the financial assistance grants, but the general purpose capital assistance is not part of this legislation either in the legalistic sense of its being included in the Bill or in the conceptual sense as it should not be regarded as being within the scope of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Assessment (No. 1) Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill represent the implementation of the Government's announcement in the Budget of measures affecting sales tax. Since the legislation is a Budget measure I indicate that the Opposition will not be opposing it. Nevertheless, we want to move to the second reading motion an amendment which is designed to draw attention to some of the serious shortcomings of the administration of the Government in respect of sales tax, and I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) notes that this Government has presided over an increasingly inefficient and inequitable indirect tax system that abounds with anomalies and inconsistencies;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls into question the Government's misguided priorities in increasing sales tax on a number of products, especially on packaging materials, when Australians are already suffering from the highest tax burden in the peace-time history of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Government to undertake a thorough review of the sales tax and indirect tax system in an endeavour to relieve the burden on long-suffering taxpayers and furnish a system that will increase the incentive to save and invest in Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned, these Bills are part of the overall taxation measures announced in the Budget back in August. They touch on only the indirect or sales tax side of the Budget. But it would be wise in order to set the scene for a discussion about indirect tax along the lines of our amendment to remind ourselves of certain statistics concerning the Budget. We know that total income tax in this Budget compared with the last financial year will increase by some 13.9 per cent, and there will be a 14.4. per cent increase in sales tax collections this year. While that difference in increases is only 0.5 of one per cent-that is, the increase in sales tax collection is only a little greater than the increase in income tax-the fact is that sales tax is still growing faster than is income tax as a whole. That is particularly relevant when compared with last year's outcomes, when we saw income tax increase during the 1988 financial year by 13.6 per cent but sales tax increased by 18.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are seeing is an unheralded, unproclaimed switch in emphasis from the raising of taxes through income tax to the raising of taxes by consumption-type taxes under this Government. The trend towards a greater proportion of taxes being raised from indirect sources is still plainly evident in the Government's program and quite obviously that is having some effects on the cost of living, which I will come to in a few minutes when I talk about inflation. First, we must establish that point clearly in the minds of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make is that when we look at the total amount of taxation collected by the Government in terms of a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country, we find that the Budget estimates that that increase this year will be 8.3 per cent, bringing the total amount of taxation collected on GDP to 27.3 per cent. In the Budget the Government makes the point that that is about 0.4 per cent, somewhat lower than the percentage of taxation revenue to gross domestic product raised last financial year. We need to adjust that a little because no doubt the Government is claiming credit for reduced taxation. One of the reasons that there has been a decrease in total revenues as distinct from total taxation is that a fall of about $1 billion in the take by the Government from the Reserve Bank of Australia has been indicated for this forthcoming financial year, compared with last year. In other words, the Government will get less from the Reserve Bank this financial year than it did last year. If one adds back that $1 billion profit that will not now be available, one finds that the percentage of gross domestic product being taken by Commonwealth taxation is the same as it was last financial year. Indeed, the Government's argument that somehow it has managed to get the taxation schedules over the slope and on the way down and that we are all headed into a far easier time tax-wise is, of course, just plainly nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to some of the questions about sales tax in particular. As I mentioned, an increase of 14.4 per cent in taxation taken by sales tax this year is mentioned in the Budget. That compares with an increase of 18.9 per cent last year. These figures are running well ahead of inflation and well ahead of inflation plus real growth in the economy. Quite clearly the Government is still moving to increase sales taxes and to rely on a higher percentage of its revenues coming from that source. The Budget Papers indicate that about 6 1/2 per cent of the increase last year came from what might be attributable to the withdrawal of sales tax exemptions for Commonwealth commercial authorities such as Telecom Australia and Australia Post. Certainly that will have accounted for large changes. I do not think we can easily dismiss the impact of that on the economy as being just some kind of statistical aberration. Senator Gareth Evans, who was then Minister for Transport and Communications, and who is now in the chamber, would understand only too well that the imposition of sales taxes on the equipment purchased by Telecom and by other Commonwealth authorities, which I think amounted to something like $400m or $500m last financial year, will have to be recouped by those organisations from the customers of those organisations in the general community. In other words, the taxation that will have to be borne by those bodies through the removal of that exemption has to be translated into higher prices for telephone calls, stamps and other government services provided by them. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of any argument about financial accountability and the imposition of proper charges so as to equate the position of Commonwealth authorities with the private sector, the fact remains that the Government is indirectly charging the people of Australia higher taxes by imposing those higher taxes on its own business authorities, which in turn pass those costs on to the community. This is a back door way of imposing taxes on the Australian people and quite clearly has just as inflationary an effect as any other form of taxation which is more directly imposed by the Government on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of sales tax in this last financial year, it is interesting to note some of the increases in the particular rate categories compared with last financial year. For instance, we see that in the most significant and I think the most representative rate class-that is, the 20 per cent rate that applies to most goods and services-the increase in the tax take this financial year will be something like 16.8 per cent compared with the increase last year. I think it is significant to mention that because, as I pointed out earlier, the rate increase this year is somewhat lower than it was last year, but when we look at the area where most items are being taxed, that is, in the 20 per cent rate category, the increase is something of the order of 17 per cent-much higher than the rate of inflation and much higher than the rate of inflation plus real growth in the economy. Therefore, we have a very determined and deliberate action on the part of the Government obviously designed to impose taxes on the Australian people in a way that can be determined or seen only as a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to draw to honourable senators' attention the Opposition's amendment relating to the ramshackle indirect tax system that we have in this country. I point out that again the Government has failed to take the opportunity to reorder the priorities, reorder the system, so as to ensure that we have a proper, more easily understood and more consistent system of indirect taxes, particularly sales tax. That opportunity has been missed again and, quite clearly, if we go on down the track of raising taxes in one category as against others in the way that has been done in this legislation, we are not going to achieve that objective of getting some kind of common sense and uniformity into the multitudinous definitional problems between particular classes of goods. There are quite clearly anomalies and inconsistencies that impose taxes on some things which are only slightly different from others which go free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we should just turn to some of the items which are to be taxed in this legislation and which have not previously been subject to tax. Firstly, I refer to what I call the `tuck shop' tax. That is the imposition of a 10 per cent tax on containers used by retailers for marketing takeaway foods. I shall return to that a little later in relation to the inflation statistics to indicate what effect that is already having in the marketplace. Secondly, a tax will now be applied to thick shakes and ice-creams, also to muesli bars and other health food bars. There also will be an imposition of a 20 per cent tax rate on packaged coffee, chocolate and malt flavoured milk drinks that contain less than 95 per cent milk. It does not sound like a government that has the interests of our children at heart when it imposes taxes on the health food and muesli bars that kids at school buy with their pocket money from the school tuck shop. Obviously it will put more hardship not only on children but also on their families as they have to dig deeper into their pockets to fund their children's lunches at the tuckshops. It is a callous government that would impose such taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes a tax rate of 10 to 20 per cent on wrapping materials for household use. This means that every time we buy something at the supermarket, at takeaway food bars, or whatever, the wrapping material that is used will bear a tax of 10 to 20 per cent. Inevitably that will be reflected in the prices people will have to pay for those products. It means that prices must rise. That is already emerging in the statistics on inflation. The consumer price index (CPI) statistics for the September quarter this year, which came out on 25 October, indicated that food prices rose by 2.8 per cent in that three-month period-a far greater increase than the average for all other commodity categories. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas where there have been significant increases is the very area we are talking about. Prices of meals out and takeaway foods have increased in all cities. As I have said, the imposition of a tax like this on wrapping or packaging material obviously will be reflected in the prices for these foods. Is it any wonder that increased prices will apply to foods as a result of this direct imposition by the Commonwealth on the Australian people? This tax will tend to fall most heavily on those people who spend most of their income on, if you like, the most staple, basic and fundamental requirements of human life-food being amongst the most important of those requirements. Therefore, those who are on the lowest incomes, such as pensioners, those in receipt of social security benefits and those on other low retirement incomes, will suffer the direct impact of the Government's taxation on packaging. That group will be most affected, because the largest part of those people's incomes goes on food or clothing. It is that category-food-which will bear the greatest impact of this Government's tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA> A government would have to be crazy, on the one hand, to say that it is trying to help pensioners by lifting tax incentives and doing things of that kind and, on the other hand, to be taking it out by imposing higher taxes on food. We do well to remind ourselves that back in 1981 the then Labor Opposition, together with the Australian Democrats, I think, opposed taxes on food that might have been applied by the then Fraser Government. Yet this Government is introducing those very measures. I know that Senator Haines cannot wait to dash to her feet to say, `Yes, we still hold that same position, but you in the Opposition are supporting the Government on this Bill'. The reason we are supporting the Bill is that it is a Budget Bill, and we are not going to deny the Government its right to impose taxes as it sees fit. That is a well established principle in this place. It will be only a political stunt by Senator Haines to draw some conclusion that we are supportive in absolute terms of this kind of approach by the Government. She knows full well that we are supporting the Bill because it is part of the Government's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are on the subject of CPI increases, we all know that the quarterly CPI increase announced a week ago indicated a collapse in the Federal Government's Budget strategy. The increase was about 2 per cent-2.6 per cent in Sydney-far greater than the Government estimated in its Budget announced only in August. The increase is almost half of the total CPI increase of 4 1/2 per cent which the Government estimated there would be for the full year. Yet it has occurred in only three months. Obviously, the Government's inflation strategy is in disarray and the inflation is being driven largely by price increases which the Government itself has generated. As I have just pointed out, that has resulted from the imposition of Government sales taxes on the packaging of food and other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area where the CPI increase has impacted heavily is housing. The increase for the three months just ended in rental and mortgage costs associated with housing and the cost of housing itself was 4 per cent-far ahead of the Government's estimate for the full year. If one were to extrapolate that on a simplistic basis-and I know that that is not entirely logical-one could say that the housing costs of this nation are increasing by 15 to 16 per cent per annum. The Government could not necessarily argue that that is not a fact in this case. We face a disaster in terms of rising living costs for Australians because of the rapid increase in building and housing costs generally. This is largely due to the Government's interest rate policies. Interest rates have increased dramatically in real terms since this Government came to power. We are seeing increased costs imposed on the Australian people as they struggle not only to buy their first homes but also to keep them. This has been difficult, given that incomes have not risen very much over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria from 1985 to 1988 housing costs have increased by 40 to 50 per cent. That must have had, and is having, obviously-from the statistics-a dramatic impact on the cost of living for the average Australian. Quite clearly, under this Government housing is getting beyond even the dreams of Australians. The Government is not helping those who are applying to State housing authorities for rental housing. During this Government's five-year period of office the total number of people seeking assistance from housing commissions in the form of rental housing has increased from 108,000 to 285,000, which demonstrates how effectively this Government is dealing with the problems of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The standard of living is falling. As has been pointed out many times by both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, the Australian people would require an increase in their incomes of $56 a week after tax to regain the living standard they enjoyed back in 1983 when this Government came to power. In other words, on average people have lost $56 a week in real terms since this Government came to power 5 1/2 years ago. That is why people are suffering in their pockets. That is why they are finding it more and more difficult to retain their housing. Fifty thousand people are sleeping out of doors these days because they have no housing. That is why 180,000 people are waiting for rental housing through State housing authorities compared with 108,000 people in 1982 when the Fraser Government went out of power. These are the facts. This Government has brought us the lowest living standards since the Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that I would like to touch on relates to retirement incomes as well. Again, I think this demonstrates where the heart of this Government really lies. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that, under the social security legislation, pensioners, retirees who are in receipt of some form of social security benefit, can earn some amount of income without having to pay tax on top of what would already be applicable to their pension. In other words, they can earn an income outside their pension and tax does not apply to that. That amount of money, which would not have attracted tax back in 1982-83-the last year of the Fraser Government-was $999. That meant that nearly $20 a week could be earned without any tax being applied to it. What is the figure today under the Hawke-Keating Government? In this current financial year that amount has fallen to $520. In other words, only $10 a week can be earned-half as much as could be earned in 1983-without attracting taxation. That is seen in dollar terms; that is in nominal money. That does not take into account the change in the value of money since 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding this debate for the Opposition, the point I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate is that those people, those retirees, those pensioners, those beneficiaries, now find that if they get out and earn a little extra money by virtue of part time work or by virtue of careful saving and investment during their working lives, they will suffer taxes at a far greater rate than they did under the former Fraser Government. That is a fact of life and it is a direct result of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talking about social security policy and retirement income policy in this country and saying that we should be encouraging people to have superannuation for investment purposes to generate other income in their retirement. We also hear them saying, `It is advisable for people to work a little longer or to take part time work after their retirement in order to generate a little extra income and so take the load off the social security system'. But, as I have just pointed out, under this system the incentive is not for people to do those things but is entirely in the opposite direction. Taxation is applied at a higher and higher rate to income that people earn on top of their pensions. Consequently, there is no incentive for people to get off the social security system or to lessen the burden on the taxpayer from their drawings of pensions and other benefits. That, therefore, runs completely in the opposite direction to what this Government claims it is trying to do with its retirement income policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this is just more and more evidence of the arrogant, out of touch mode into which this Government has fallen in recent times and which has quite clearly been demonstrated and understood by the people of Australia. Of course, the clear evidence of that is in the recent by-election results in what are and have been called the safe Labor seats of Adelaide, Port Adelaide and Oxley. It looks as though such by-election results will continue while this Government carries on with its misguided policies in handling the affairs of the Australian people. Australian living standards are falling and will continue to fall through this Government's deliberate policies and actions. The sales tax Bills are clear evidence of a continuance of those misguided policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the Senate today implements changes to sales taxes across the board in a wide range of areas announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Budget night. I must say that, listening to Senator Messner, I have been touched by his concern for low income families. I found his reference to a tuckshop tax particularly tender, given that none of this would be happening if the current Opposition took the same attitude to this legislation as members of the Opposition did back in 1981. It is all very well for Senator Messner and others to express concern about low income families and what has happened to them under this Government over the last few years, but he needs to remember that the Government can only implement these proposals if the Senate supports them and that means that it has to get a majority of senators in this place on its side. In most of the legislation that has hammered away at low income families and at some middle income families it has not been the Australian Democrats that have supported the legislation but the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand from a Bulletin article of a couple of weeks ago-and one always believes what one reads in magazines of that calibre-that there are some people within the Opposition parties who are now questioning these inane, if not insane, decisions that they made in 1983 to allow the Government to have all its Budget legislation, however appalling they thought it might be. That is something they are obviously regretting but, in the meantime, it has done quite a significant amount of damage to low income families-damage that will be increased by the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Those families have already been hard hit. This Government cut Austudy payments for 15-year-olds in the last two years of school. We need to remember that those Austudy payments were going only to very low income families, so those students had their final years of education placed in considerable jeopardy when Liberal and National Party senators here allied themselves with the Government to pass that legislation. Widows of 45 years of age on a class B widow's pension suddenly found themselves standing in queues at Commonwealth Employment Service offices because this Government decided, and the Opposition supported it, that once their youngest child turned 16, they should go off that widow's class B pension and go onto the unemployment benefit-and there are not too many jobs around for women who have been out of the work force raising a family for 20 or more years. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners had their pre-Christmas consumer price index related increase delayed by this Government and by this Opposition. Increasingly we are seeing low income families hit as this Government succumbs to business pressure to cut its expenditure. It is cutting expenditure in the areas of health, housing, education and social welfare-areas that are all hitting hardest low income families-while allowing corporate welfare to remain alive and well. So we have on the other end of the scale some of the biggest companies in this country paying little or, in the case of the Bond Corporation, no tax on record profits. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I remember vividly the debate in 1981 on the Fraser sales tax legislation. Of course, we were in the old Parliament House and the Senate chamber was pretty much packed from beginning to end during the second reading debates. It was an important piece of legislation for the Fraser Government because it was facing a hostile Senate. It was an important piece of legislation for the Labor Opposition because it was doing its best to discredit the Democrats. The legislation that was introduced by the Fraser Government introduced sales tax on a wide range of goods such as furs, gold-plated cutlery, jewellery and artificial flowers for goodness sake and the Labor Opposition in those days wanted the sales tax removed from those things as well as from the things that the Democrats were concerned about, the things that we classified in 1981 as the necessities of life-food, clothing, books, building materials for domestic dwellings, educational materials and newspapers. So inconsistency in oppositions as well as, I guess, in governments is nothing new across the board. But when it comes to sales tax legislation I am disappointed that there is less interest, apparently, in the Parliament in these particular sales tax Bills than there was in the monumental legislation that the Fraser Government introduced in 1981 and faced accepting amendments to. That is what happened in 1981. Amendments were moved to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill or, bearing in mind the constitutional requirements, the Senate requested amendments of the House. That Bill went back and forth from the Senate chamber to the House while we argued whether the Government would accede to the request for amendments. Finally, those items were deleted from the sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not crumble in December 1981. Changing that legislation was not the same as what happened in 1975 when a government was denied its right to spend money. It is about time that the Opposition, the public and the media realised that there is a vast difference between the two events; between stopping a government from legally spending money, as happened in 1975 which brought the Government down, and a Senate exercising its legitimate powers as a House of Review and amending what it sees as iniquitous legislation, whether it is brought up as part of a Budget package or not. As a result of the 1983 decision made by the Opposition parties to support all government Budget Bills, whether they are good, bad or indifferent, the Government has now moved to two Budgets a year. We have one in May called the May Economic Statement and we have one brought down in August. So the Government is now guaranteed of getting twice as much legislation through, no matter who will be hurt by it and no matter how anomalous or iniquitous it may be. It is rather ironic that the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) in his second reading speech had the unmitigated gall to make this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Bill will correct . . . a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the various schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>What he set about doing, in all but one or two cases, was increasing those charges. The one monumental exception to that-and I do not recall hearing Senator Messner mention it; I apologise if he did and I did not hear it-was that while the Government was happily putting charges on food containers, on various foodstuffs, on other commodities used by ordinary, average Australians and their families, it took off the sales tax on private jets. I find that a pretty amazing way for a government to sort out an anomaly-to increase the cost of living for ordinary Australian families while making sure that those people who could afford a private jet did not have the additional cost of paying sales tax on it. In the meantime, people with some form of disability-say, a thalidomide child-who wish to use a modified computer are required to pay sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister: Exactly where are the anomalies starting and finishing in that sort of situation? There is no doubt that the sales tax system in this country is in a shambles. Senator Messner was right in that element of his speech today and we will certainly be supporting the second reading attachment that the Opposition has circulated which makes that point loudly and clearly. The sales tax system in this country is full of anomalies. It is a mess. What is worse is that the current legislation further muddies the water by extending the anomalies and I would have thought-and I guess this is a major irony in this place that we are constantly confronted with-runs totally counter to the views expressed on sales taxes by the Australian Labor Party when it is in opposition or when it is appealing to what was its natural constituency, a group of people who must be wondering who now supports them when they are in need. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said back in 1981, when the Fraser Government tried to apply a general sales tax on products ranging from gold-plated cutlery to books, clothing, and so on, the then Labor Opposition rose up in righteous indignation. It said that the legislation was iniquitous and unfair, and that it had to be stopped at all costs. It did not want it amended to take out those items that did affect ordinary people; it had to be blocked in toto. `How wimpy the Democrats are', it said. `How typically dithery of them only to want to amend it to take out the necessities of life. You can't have a sales tax on gold-plated cutlery or on furs. We have to defeat the whole package of Bills', the Labor Party claimed in 1981. It was not satisfied simply with removing those items that would damage Australian families, low income ones in particular. Mr Howard, when he was Treasurer, in introducing that sales tax legislation that year said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Fraser Government-</PARA>
<PARA>decided earlier this year against a major restructuring of the tax system towards greater reliance on broadly based indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that that decision did not rule out later consideration of smaller adjustments within the present system. To this end Mr Howard went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>that is in 1981-</PARA>
<PARA>has decided to increase by 2 1/2 per cent each of the existing rates of sales tax, effective in relation to goods passing the taxing point after tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will also provide for the correction of a significant number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the sales tax law . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government will be bringing in legislation as soon as practicable to tax, at a rate of 2 1/2 per cent, a range of goods that are now exempt-such as clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester; building materials; books, magazines and newspapers; packaging and wrapping materials-</PARA>
<PARA>the very things that Senator Messner today is so angry about-</PARA>
<PARA>hand tools; and certain other goods but not including medicines, food or wine.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Howard said in his Budget Speech in August 1981. The Labor Opposition went out of its collective head at the enormous extra cost that was being placed on people. Newspaper headlines echoed the Labor Opposition's criticisms. No journalists, from memory, in 1981, bothered to ask why the Labor Opposition was opposed to a tax on gold-plated cutlery. No journalists pointed out that the previous Whitlam Government had slapped a sales tax on a range of items, including children's soft drinks. Instead they argued, as Labor did, that the Fraser Government's legislation should be opposed in toto.</PARA>
<PARA> We were not suggesting that then and we are not suggesting that now. We think that this legislation before us today is open to amendment. My colleague Senator Macklin will, in the committee stage, move an amendment relating to a matter that I raised a moment ago, that is, the serious anomaly that still relates to goods not covered by any other item in the schedule that are used as special aids for people with physical or mental handicaps. That includes such things as computer equipment. We are not saying that somebody should simply write a letter and say, `My child has a disability and I need a special computer'. We have hedged the amendment about with protection as far as the Government is concerned so that there has to be a report from a medical practitioner or somebody else in the medical area who is suitably qualified. I am sure that Senator Macklin, when we get to the committee stage, will put a significant argument both to the Government and to the Opposition to deal properly with this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what has happened since the Australian Labor Party came to office, bearing in mind what it said in  1981-82 about sales tax. Far from ensuring that foodstuffs remain free of sales tax as it claimed they should when it was in opposition, this Government has moved to bring more and more items into the sales tax schedules. This is except, of course, as I said, for private jets which have now become sales tax exempt on the grounds, according to the Government, that it is too difficult to administer. It is apparently not too difficult to administer the sales tax on containers for takeaway food, for ice-creams or for flavoured soya milk, but it is too difficult to administer a sales tax on private jets. The Government has seen fit to make certain foodstuffs now liable to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These foodstuffs all incur the rate of 10 per cent sales tax: confectionery; ice-cream; biscuits; savoury snacks and their ingredients; packaged, flavoured milk drinks provided that they consist of not less than 95 per cent milk-any less than that and they get hit with a higher tax-packaged fruit juice products; fermented alcoholic beverages, including wines and ciders but not beverages that contain more than 1.15 per cent alcohol; and beers and spirits about which I will say more later because this has to be the biggest con trick on the CPI we have seen for a while; and containers for the abovementioned goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only will most of these increase housekeeping costs, as Senator Messner said, but for low income families in particular they will force parents to cut back on treats for their children. It will not bother me particularly that confectionery, ice-cream, biscuits and savour snacks and their ingredients have gone up by 10 per cent. Most of the time I do not eat those products. My children are both in the work force and can more than adequately afford to provide their own. But any family living on some sort of pension or benefit, any family living on considerably less than average weekly earnings or indeed any family living on average weekly earnings with several children will find itself saying more and more to those children, `No, I am sorry we can't afford it'. Beer, however, along with private planes, has been the exception in all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get into the gender debate. But it is a fact that when it comes to things like purchasing confectionery, ice-cream, biscuits and what have you, it is the adult female of the household whose housekeeping has to stretch to cover that increase. Very few women, as far as I know, however, own private planes. So they will not benefit from the sales tax cut. I would love to know a woman who did. Senator Reynolds is nodding her head in agreement. I do not know if there is one but I doubt it very much. Beer is not something that most women purchase at 5.30 or 6.00 at night on their way home from work. What do we see happening? The Government has decided to remove the sales tax exemption for beer so that all beer will be subject to a tax at the 20 per cent rate irrespective of the volume of alcohol or country of manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA> However, excises have been reduced. As a consequence the overall price of beer has dropped. Coincidentally, this has affected the CPI which should now drop by around 0.03 per cent. It is an amazing coincidence that this should occur. I might also point out that in some areas this drop in the price of beer has been slow coming in any event as the manufacturers, the publicans, or somebody else has seen the heaven sent opportunity to make a windfall profit in all of this by upping the sales tax but not reducing the excise and not passing the cuts on to the consumer. Where it has happened I guess the cynics in here, of whom I occasionally count myself as one, would say that the action was taken by a government keen to woo the working man's vote again and keen to con the journalists who were interested in such things into believing that the CPI will drop as a result of other actions that the Government has taken to straighten out the Australian economy. We now have hit those confectionery items that I mentioned: muesli bars; health foods; ice-cream mixes; thick shake mixes; packaged flavoured milk and soya milk. </PARA>
<PARA> Plain milk, I would point out, is at present exempt from sales tax although flavoured milk is not. Under the proposed changes beverages consisting wholly or principally of soya milk will be exempt. However, presumably in order not to create an anomaly in the case of packaged flavoured milk the rate of 10 per cent applies. This will also now apply to flavoured beverages consisting principally of soya milk. I do not know whether the Government is aware of the fact that there are an increasing number of children in this community who cannot physically tolerate milk or milk products. Their parents turn to soya milk products as an alternative. Soya milk is not to everyone's taste. It is certainly not to a great many children's taste. Adding a little flavouring sometimes helps the medicine go down. What does this Government do? It taxes it. Presumably it does this on the grounds that if one has a sick child it is one's fault in much the same way as the Government is saying, `Don't blame us for children in poverty. Blame the parents who can't run their expenditure properly'. So the Government allows soya milk to be tax free but the minute it is sold with any flavouring in it it is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to this question of sales taxes on private aircraft because it has, I think-the Minister may care to correct me on this-another interesting anomaly. We are removing this sales tax because, according to the explanatory memorandum, there are in fact very few taxable sales of aircraft and the cost of administering the current law is high. We also find hidden in the sales tax increases things such as bathroom fittings. I would like the Minister to tell me something, just as a matter of curiosity-because of the position the Opposition is taking we cannot do much about it. If a family purchases bathroom fittings for their home, are those fittings liable to sales tax? If, however, the fittings are put in John Elliott's plane or somebody else's private jet so that they have a sumptuous bathroom to go to after drinking all that beer, are the fittings sales tax exempt? If they are, they ought not to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite what the Minister said in his second reading speech, this legislation goes nowhere at all in correcting anomalies. It certainly does not improve the standard of living of low and middle income earners. It goes no way at all to fulfilling a Labor government's commitment to people who, if they are not currently living in poverty, soon will be. It is a further example of the way in which, when it suits governments, they can help their business mates and do it at the expense of their traditional supporters. I hope the Opposition will think again about the only amendment we will be moving during the committee stage. It is clearly pointless for us to try to amend the legislation so that things like flavoured soy milk continue to be exempt, because I presume we are not going to get any support for that. However, there is a very real problem for people with disabilities who need access to certain equipment, including computers, which when suitably adapted for them assist in improving their living standards and increasing their learning capacity. I would ask the Opposition at least to consider that. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out in the second reading attachment to this piece of legislation, the sales tax field is full of anomalies. We agree. We will be supporting that attachment. In return I ask the Opposition to support the one amendment we will be moving, which will make life a lot easier for kids with disabilities and for the families of children with disabilities, and which will remove a most unpleasant anomaly in the current sales tax legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the changes to sales tax which were brought about by the recent Budget. Before I go into that I wish to comment on some of the remarks of Senator Haines. The Australian Democrats show the greatest hypocrisy in this place. We are consistent in that we come in here and talk about reduced government spending and reduced taxes. We complain bitterly about the level of taxation and the complexity of the taxation system. There is a consistency about our complaints. The Australian Democrats come in here and side with the Government or seek to initiate programs which involve the destruction of the wealth-creating industries in this country and at the same time demand increases in government expenditure.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everyone in the country is aware of what has happened to the Democrats in recent years, particularly since the resignation of Senator Chipp. They have become the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. What we have in this legislation is a classic example of taxation by stealth. The Government talks about rationalisation of the sales tax law. What they mean by that, of course, is to pick up things they forgot the last time they amended the sales tax law. As a result, a whole range of consumer goods at the youth end of the market will now be slugged with sales tax. This could be called the `kick the kids' section of the 1988-89 Budget. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), not content with plundering individual taxpayers and businesses, is now taxing children. These pocket-money pinching measures include a tax at 20 per cent, which was not there before, on all pre-packaged coffee, chocolate and malt flavoured milk drinks with less than 95 per cent milk; a tax at 10 per cent on containers used in marketing biscuits, snack foods, ice-cream and take away food and drinks; a tax at 10 per cent on thick shake mixes and ice-cream mixes; a tax at 10 per cent on muesli bars and similar health food bars. It could be said that the Treasurer, Captain Snatch, strikes again. The alterations brought about by these Bills include the removal of beer excise and the reduction in sales tax on some goods such as cosmetics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To pretend that these changes will significantly reform sales tax is plainly ridiculous. The legislation is just a cynical attempt to manipulate the inflation rate by tampering with beer prices in order to restore credibility to the Treasurer's forecast in the Budget that the inflation rate will be down to 4.5 per cent by June next year. As the latest consumer price index (CPI) figures show, the Treasurer's forecast of around 7.3 per cent annualised is like the beer-all froth and bubble. Meanwhile, these changes will create only more problems for Australia's 80,000 small businessmen, who must try to operate within the Government's tangled sales tax web, and what a tangled web it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Complaints against the sales tax system as we know it include a whole range of businesses being inadequately informed of Australian Taxation Office rulings-rulings which are so complex and obscure that business people must regularly seek legal and professional advice to clarify them. Inconsistencies vary from State to State. This is not new; it goes back years. I am aware of that. As an example, Senator Brownhill and I have been trying for months to clarify whether simple things like chainsaws purchased by farmers and agriculturalists are exempt from sales tax. After many letters and phone calls over a period of months, the position is still not very clear. I think it is worth recounting briefly the details of this case because it nicely illustrates what an absolute dog's breakfast the sales tax system is, not to mention the bureaucratic trivia that people trying to run businesses in this country have to contend with. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of this debate, the problem is not just the level of taxation in this country, which is enormously high-too high-and penalises everyone from the lower socioeconomic group right through; it is also the complexity of the tax system. The income tax system is complex enough but the sales tax system is incredibly complex. The saga began when a Queensland business which sells chainsaws predominantly to rural people received a ruling from the Taxation Office branch in Brisbane that chainsaws could be purchased exempt from sales tax only if they were used in manufacturing fence posts for sale. Following representations on the issue this ruling was withdrawn within about a month and a new ruling made that farmers and other primary producers could buy chainsaws exempt from sales tax if they were used primarily and principally for manufacturing fence posts or stockyards, either for their own use or for sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is how one defines `primarily and principally'. What does it mean? Several letters to the Australian Taxation Office later it was established that `primarily and principally' refers to 50 per cent or more of the use of the saw. That clarified the position in Queensland to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, south of the border, in New South Wales, Senator Brownhill was told a quite different story when he made inquiries about sales tax exemptions for these items which are an essential part of the majority of rural properties. He received all the information I did, but the New South Wales sales tax branch also added that in its opinion, while the sales tax ruling permits exemptions to be claimed on chainsaws, it thought it unlikely that farmers would actually be able to do so since few farmers would meet the test of using their saws primarily and principally for making wooden fence posts or building stockyards. This advice is not being given by the Queensland sales tax office, to the advantage of the graziers in Queensland. Subsequently farmers claim and receive the exemption, while their southern counterparts over the border are not permitted to do so. Just in case any problems arise with the Taxation Office, chainsaw retailers in Queensland have now sought legal opinion confirming that the rulings from the Queensland branch imply that they can offer the sales tax exemptions to primary producers. I am told that it is just pot luck when it comes to receiving sales tax exemptions. It depends on whether one is dealing with a sympathetic sales tax officer. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions were also raised about whether a farmer could claim a tax exemption on a chainsaw if he could establish that the chainsaw was used primarily and principally as an aid to manufacture-for example, pruning fruit trees or cutting mulga to feed stock in drought stricken areas, which is not uncommon, as Senator Burns, who is now in the chair, will be aware from his experience in that State. This opened a real can of worms. Sales tax exemptions can be claimed if a hand tool is used as an aid to manufacture, but only if it fits within the Taxation Office's ruling on the definition of the word `manufacture'. Manufacture in this case means severing from the land, harvesting or breeding. A farmer can claim sales tax exemption for a tool that he uses to pick fruit from trees, but cannot claim for a chainsaw which he uses to prune those trees. He could claim sales tax exemption for a tool which harvests his crops, but not for a tool which sows the seeds of those crops; but primary producers can claim exemption for chainsaws when they are used to clear noxious weeds and scrub. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into any more detail, I believe that the worst aspect is that this is inconsistent, anomalous and unfair. If a system that is supposed to be Australia-wide contains such anomalies, I believe that it is drastically wrong. So much for this Government which, four years ago, said that it would set up a summit to look at the tax system and that one of its major aims would be to simplify the system. The Government has not got anywhere near that situation and in fact has gone in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is patently obvious-and I do not have to remind the people of Australia of this fact-that we now have the highest taxing government this country has ever seen outside wartime conditions. To give some examples, in 1983-84 the consumer price index increased by 3.9 per cent. The reason that it was so low flowed from the Fraser Government's wage freeze in the previous year. If we believe the CPI figure in the Treasurer's Budget Speech, as I will for the purpose of this exercise, the total CPI increase for the period 1983-84 to 1988-89 was about 50 per cent. In Japan in the same period the CPI was around 6.5 per cent. However, be that as it may, the sales tax increase over the same period, with an increase in CPI of 50 per cent, has been 147 per cent. I know people will argue that some growth is involved, and that is true, but even when one adds in the growth factor the figure is still incredibly bad. We have an absolute wrong sense of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two areas where we are reasonably successful. One is the mining industry and the other is in agriculture. When we compare the manufacturing industry with industries in the rest of the world, particularly our South East Asian neighbours and the more developed countries, we must conclude that we are a Third World country. One of the major reasons is that the level of taxation imposed by this Government has made it impossible for people to be able to invest in such things as high-tech research and development. Industry is criticised for this, but nobody asks why. There are many answers, but a major answer is that industries do not have the generative income to do these things because the Government rips off their income. In fact, one of the few honest people on the other side, Senator Cook, is renowned for his statement `We are a high taxing government, because we have to be to implement our reforms'. I think the people of Australia are suddenly discovering that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin interjected and asked for one example where the Democrats go out of their way to affect the wealth-producing industries of this country. However, no matter what subject comes up in the mining industry, with few execptions the Democrats find a reason as to why it should not happen. We have heard all the language, whether from Senator Sanders or some of his predecessors; whenever a proposal arises they kick it to death. Yet without that industry our standards of living in this country would be much lower than they are today-and, for God's sake, they are low enough. In conclusion I wish to add my support to the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Messner in relation to this amending Bill in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add `, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) notes that this Government has presided over an increasingly inefficient and inequitable indirect tax system that abounds with anomalies and inconsistencies;</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to hear that, on this rare occasion, Senator Haines and her Democrat colleagues will be supporting the Opposition. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(2) calls into question the Government's misguided priorities in increasing sales tax on a number of products, especially on packaging materials, when Australians are already suffering from the highest tax burden in the peace-time history of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>(3) calls on the Government to undertake a thorough review of the sales tax and indirect tax system in an endeavour to relieve the burden on long-suffering taxpayers and furnish a system that will increase the incentive to save and invest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has a preoccupation with taxing individuals and companies. I am not referring to people who evade or avoid tax, as I believe they should pay their taxes. But I am saying that, while the level of tax imposed in this country continues to grow, there is no way in the world that this country will get itself off the floor, increase the level of its manufacturing sector and thus provide jobs and the wealth needed to be able to pay for government programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had another debate on sales tax legislation-mercifully, somewhat shorter than we have had on previous occasions, but equally as boring. It is true that determining what rate of sales tax ought to apply to a particular item, whether an item should be excluded altogether, so that a zero rate applies, or whether a 20 per cent or 30 per cent rate should apply, are judgmental questions. It will always be so. I am sure that it has occurred to Senator Parer, Senator Messner and a few others that there is one way of resolving the question, which is probably what members of the Opposition have in the back of their minds-that is, to have a uniform rate applying to everything.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but it is at the back of yours. I do not necessarily mean Senator Lewis personally but the Opposition collectively. What was new in today's debate, of course, was an attempt yet again to misrepresent the figures relating to sales tax, the 13.9 per cent or 14 per cent growth-whatever the figure was-which, of course, totally ignores the fact that there is for the first time a sales tax on beer which has been more than offset by the reduction in the excise on beer, at a net loss to revenue of approximately $400m in the first year of its inception and $445m in the second year. I know Senator Messner knows that that is the case, but he still chooses to try to misrepresent the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes, other than the decision to impose an excise on beer, are all relatively minor. So far as I can recall, every year since we have been in government there have been modifications to the sales tax list. As I said before, it is a difficult judgment to make. However, contrary to what is implicit in some of the other comments that have been made, in the changes that have been made to sales tax other than beer in this year there has been a minor loss to revenue, not an increase as has occurred sometimes in the past. I do not recall the exact figure, but I think the estimate was that the net loss to revenue would be approximately $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading, which the Government will not accept for the reasons that I have already stated, among others. Senator Macklin has given notice of an amendment that he will move in the committee stage which I am advised is identical to the amendment that he moved last year, and which the Government will not accept either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time in the Senate yesterday Senator    Sanders asked be about removal procedures of the Bogong moths which have confused this building with the Brindabella Mountains. Honourable senators will have noticed that the situation worsened considerably overnight. The only places inside the building which have been severely affected are the President's walkway and office on this side of the building and similar areas in the Speaker's suite. The cleaning staff, faced with thousands of moths in the walkway early this morning, undertook limited spraying with a commonly available household spray. This operation was carried out by properly equipped and protected cleaning personnel. I have been informed that this technique of dealing with the moths inside the building was necessary for the safe operation of vital functions in the building-especially the air-conditioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The advice received by the Joint House Department from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is that there is nothing which can be done about the moths on the outside of the building. They will be left in peace until they decide to continue their migration. We have been informed that this may not be for some weeks, depending on weather conditions and other variables known only to the moths themselves. There will be no spraying of the outside of the building and any spraying inside the building will be strictly limited and only where the problem is so acute that action needs to be taken for the safe operation of the building. I might point out that the burning smell evident at the moment is caused by the moths falling into the lighting system. I will continue to keep the Senate informed on this matter.</PARA>

Mr Hand approached me, I think last Thursday, to explore the possibility of getting a Department of Finance officer seconded for a period to the Aboriginal Development Commission and possibly to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as well to advise on financial procedures. That almost certainly will be done but the final details have not yet been settled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training seen reports claiming that the Government has made `ridiculous grants' to the trade union movement for educational and humanitarian aid programs? Do these claims have any basis in fact, and in particular are the allegations concerning direct Government grants to the Australian Teachers Federation (ATF) justified?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1802" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume the claims to which Senator Zakharov has referred are those reported in the May-July issue of the Institute of Public Affairs Review, in an article written by Senator Short. He claimed in his article that the Teachers Federation had received from the Government $8,000 for training in the community program for female teachers in Australia; $4,700 for a teacher-trade union seminar; $7,000 for an orientation program for the All India Secretary Teachers Association-that is Secretary, sic; $10,000 to the Pacific Teachers Trade Union Trainers; $5,000 for continuing education for Anglican teachers on the West Bank; $12,000 for an English as a second language training program in Tanzania; and $7,500 for a health worker training program in Phnom Penh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point I make is that the last of those grants, the one relating to Cambodia, was not even made to the ATF. Secondly, and I referred to this point a while ago, a grant was made to the All India Secondary Teachers Association, not the Secretary Teachers Association as Senator Short's article said. Thirdly, and most importantly, the grants mentioned did not come from the Government directly but from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, commonly known as AIDAB. I suppose it is legitimate to argue that governments should not delegate responsibility for the distribution of public money to any administrative body whatsoever; nevertheless it has been the practice of this Government, at least the previous Government and probably many governments previous to that, to administer not only AIDAB money but a number of moneys in an arms length way through an appointed body. The Australia Council is an obvious example in the domestic case. Senator Short, in his eagerness to indulge in a grubby little exercise, has also omitted from his article the fact that the ATF was granted non-government organisation aid status, making it eligible to receive AIDAB funding, under the administration of the previous Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) is holding its twenty-ninth congress in Australia next year. I am sure that the city of Perth is very pleased that it has been chosen as the site for this congress. Given the debate that has gone on in Australia over the past six months, particularly about the role and responsibilities of local government, I think it is most appropriate that the congress is being held in Australia next year. The Office of Local Government is a member of the International Union of Local Authorities. This worldwide representative organisation of local government was founded in 1913 and is based in The Hague. Perhaps the longevity of the organisation indicates quite clearly just how long local government has played a very important role in communities throughout the world, and indeed here in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the recent referendum debate many people were suggesting that local government, with its responsibilities, was somehow a new, challenging and radical proposition. I think that the existence of this organisation indicates just how long local government has been important and how it is recognised in international forums. IULA's objectives are to strengthen the status and capacity of local government, which I am sure Opposition senators would agree with; to raise the standard of local administration; to encourage citizens to participate in community affairs; and to promote cooperation and consultation among councils and, I hope, in intergovernmental relations.</PARA>
<PARA> IULA has compiled a worldwide declaration of local self-government, which is currently under review by the United Nations. This issue was raised at the local government Ministers conference in Brisbane in June this year and I am currently seeking the advice of Ministers in all States before determining what the Australian Government's response will be. As I said earlier, the twenty-ninth congress to be held in Perth next year will be an ideal opportunity for Australia to demonstrate proudly the work it does in local government and, indeed, to learn of local government initiatives in other parts of the world.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, concerns media reports that the Australian Government is considering stationing an Australian Army unit some 20 kilometres from the Papua New Guinea- Indonesian border. While acknowledging the reality that border skirmishes involving the Indonesians will continue for some time, I ask whether the Australian Government is considering a move that could increase the likelihood of the Australian military becoming entangled in future Indonesian Papua New Guinea conflict? Secondly, in his recent visit to Indonesia did the Minister raise with the Indonesian authorities the prospect of Australia moving an Army engineering unit to within 20 kilometres of the Papua New Guinea-Indonesian border and, if so, what was their response? Did he also raise the possibility of a joint Australian-Indonesian effort to improve infrastructure and therefore communications on the border between the two countries? If this question of a joint team was raised, was the Indonesian response positive?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1803" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal to station a unit of Australian engineers to assist in road construction and similar civil projects has been discussed now for some two years. It is not a recent proposal; it is not in any sense a response to recent events on the border or anywhere else in Papua New Guinea, but is just an example of an extended area of possible defence cooperation. There has been such a team of engineers in Papua New Guinea stationed in Mendi and before that in Popondetta for some 25 years. The unit involves some 25 professional engineers and support staff and the concept was to do something the same elsewhere in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument for locating that particular unit in the west Sepik area around Vanimo is fairly compelling in terms of the quality of the road system there and the inadequacy of that road system for the purposes of effective administration of the border area from the Papua New Guinea side. Locating the unit there is an attractive option and is acknowledged as such by the Papua New Guinea Government, as well as by the Australian defence side, but no final decision has yet been made to do so. That decision will certainly depend on the final response we receive from the Papua New Guinea Government. That response will, in turn, undoubtedly take into account the questions of possible sensitivities about the location of the unit in a particular area-not only foreign government sensitivities but also some of the local political sensitivities of those who might be missing out on road construction as a result of its being located close to the border. All those issues remain to be finally talked through and resolved, although they were aired in a very constructive way in the two-day meeting that I have just concluded in Wewak with my colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, and the counterpart Papua New Guinea Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of a likely Indonesian reaction, I did not specifically raise that issue in the course of my extensive discussions with the Indonesian Government because it simply had not come to the point of a decision being made or even imminent on the PNG side as to where it wanted the unit located. However, on the basis of the general scope and flavour of those discussions that we did have about the border issue, I would be very surprised indeed if the Indonesians responded to the location of such a unit in, say, the Vanimo area in anything other than a positive way.</PARA>
<PARA> The Indonesian Government is concerned to improve-as we all are-the quality of communications, both physical and telephonic, in that region in order that there can be a greater focus of resources on both sides of the border on administering that volatile and sensitive area and doing so in an effective way. Clearly, the construction of an effective road system on the PNG side would contribute to that more effective administration. These are no doubt issues that Mr Somare will canvass with his Indonesian counterparts in the course of the visit he proposes to make to Indonesia in the next few days. There has been no discussion of which I am aware-certainly none in which I participated-about any joint Australian- Indonesian exercise being directed towards infrastructure, communications or anything else. I am aware only of the matters to which I have already referred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Treasurer noticed a newspaper article in which Senator Sheil has allegedly `blasted the Commonwealth Government for selling census information to private enterprise'? Is one of the reasons for census collections to allow government and non-government agencies to make future plans based on sound statistical data?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a copy of the article. Indeed, I have it here. The answers to the four questions, in short, are yes, yes, no and yes; but I will say a little more than that. The kindest thing I can think of to say about this little report attributable to Senator Sheil is that it is not nearly as silly as the letters he was writing to Senator Ray a while ago, complaining that his electoral staff were not paid when they had been working in the office for 14 months but Senator Sheil had not bothered to tell Senator Ray, the Department or anybody else that they were so working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plain fact is that the Government spends about $127m a year at present on running the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Senator Sheil seems to believe that no information pursuant to the statistics that are collected should be released to the public. I stress that the Act explicitly prohibits the ABS making available to the public information that identifies any individual. Indeed, it would be a breach of the Act to make such information available to other branches of government, as I recall it. So, on a non-identifiable basis it would make little sense if the large amount of money spent on the ABS was to provide information to government only and not to provide to the private sector information which is useful to it and which assists in the functioning of the economy; for example, such basic information as the current size of the work force and likely changes in the size of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> After Senator Sheil gets through that, he drifts into spurious arguments about privacy-a technique that he picked up, I presume, from reading too many League of Rights publications. But I also notice that that paranoia, as exhibited in the League of Rights publications, is still being parroted, unfortunately, by a number of members of the Opposition, although I note for the record that, with the exception of Senator Sheil, the Queensland National Party seems to have finally realised that the League of Rights was a bit of a viper that it was nurturing-that it was a willing source of assistance in the past but has now become an electoral threat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that I have not seen the article, but I have here a report which supplies some information relevant to it. The Government is pursuing a number of measures to encourage the participation of women in non-traditional trades. To that end, a working group of Commonwealth and State officials, known as the Commonwealth-State Training Advisory Committee on Women in Apprenticeships, was set up in 1986 to consider measures which might lead to the increasing participation of women in that area. One of the initiatives currently being pursued provides for joint Commonwealth-State funding for `tradeswomen on the move', projects designed to encourage young women to consider a non-traditional trade as a viable career option through the provision of role models.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also providing $700,000 in this financial year to State and Territory governments for designated preparatory course places for women.

<PARA> In conclusion, this is an area, like employment areas or qualification and training areas in general, in which the direct role of the Commonwealth Government is necessarily somewhat limited because State legislation usually controls such matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have already said sufficient on that subject while I was away. It was widely reported and there is no need for me to repeat it now. Obviously, I remain willing, as does any Labor Foreign Minister, to take up questions of human rights abuse if we believe there is some kind of sound prima facie case, or some reasonably substantial evidentiary base, on which such a proposition could be put forward. Up until now I have received no such sound prima facie material or substantial evidentiary base, so at this stage it would be quite premature for the matter to be pursued in the form of representations by me of the kind that Mr Lamb was apparently wanting me to make. Nonetheless, if any such evidence comes forward, I would be only too happy to raise the matter. In fact, I foreshadowed in my discussions with the Indonesian Foreign Minister that, just as we systematically and consistently raise human rights issues with other friendly and less friendly governments all round the world, so too we would continue to do so in the future; and we discussed ways and means and channels through which such representations and requests for information could be made. Of course, that is a practice that I intend to follow in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the gross value of rural production in Australia this financial year will be $21.6 billion. It is because we have a clean herd and a very healthy and clean crop that we are able to realise that sort of income. One of the key aspects of guaranteeing that we can earn that type of income is for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to conclude memorandums of agreement, such as the one we signed in Wewak yesterday when I was with a delegation of Australian Ministers, led by Senator Gareth Evans, at a ministerial forum taking place between Papua New Guinea Ministers, led by Michael Somare, and Australian Ministers as a consequence of a joint declaration of principles between our two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Papua New Guinea, like Australia, is free from rabies, foot and mouth disease, Newcastle disease and pork measles in terms of cattle, chicken and pig diseases. From a grains point of view it is also free of khapra beetle, the moko disease which affects bananas, blister blight which affects tea, and fruit fly. It is in the interests of both countries that we jointly cooperate, particularly in the Torres Strait, to make sure for both our sakes that we remain free of those diseases; and indeed, because across the border in Irian Jaya Newcastle disease and examples of pork measles have been found in their virulent form.</PARA>
<PARA> The memorandum of agreement that we have concluded with Papua New Guinea guarantees that we will have a regional quarantine strategy to protect ourselves in the cases of all of those diseases; that we will run joint surveys to identify problems, particularly in Torres Strait; that we will harmonise our quarantine procedures so that the indigenous peoples living in Torres Strait, on both sides of the border, can be under a simplified and understandable regime and know what that regime is, and be able to go about their normal subsistence fishing and continue their lifestyles without undue delay; and that we will exchange information on pests and diseases as they occur. From a quarantine point of view it is quite an important development for Australia and one that I would hope to emulate with Indonesia when we seek later to conclude a similar memorandum of understanding with that country from a quarantine point of view so that our forward defences on quarantine are intact.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles asked me what other matters of a resources nature were dealt with at the forum. I think a number of important issues were canvassed between me and the the Papua New Guinea Ministers. Just to name a few, we discussed under what circumstances the vessel Rig Seismic, our offshore seismic surveying vessel, might be able to be used in Papua New Guinea waters, particularly in areas where there is thought to be high prospectivity for oil and gas. We talked about the possibility of sharing greater information between our two countries-both of us are major resource countries-on what the market holds for resources, and that is an important aspect for Papua New Guinea from a gold as well as a copper point of view. We talked about sharing the environmental package that the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory have in place for offshore drilling so that that environmental package could be used by Papua New Guinea, if it so chooses, in any offshore work done in its waters on the Continental Shelf. I was able to say that, from discussions with a number of major Australian companies, there is a great deal of interest in resource exploration in Papua New Guinea, and indeed, in the case of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and the recent riots that occurred at Ok Tedi, that company, as the company that has now taken over the operation of the Ok Tedi goldmine, has recognised some of the underlying problems that gave rise to those riots. BHP, as a good corporate citizen in Papua New Guinea, is keen to address those problems to remove that type of friction that might occur in a remote mining settlement. I thought it was a very useful and productive exchange, and it must strengthen the cooperation between our two countries.</PARA>

Further, how does the Government explain to the people of Australia the calculations of the Australian Local Government Association, which has compared current construction and maintenance spending on roads against vehicle density in the mid-1980s, clearly showing that road spending is now half of the mid-1960 levels, and all this at a time when local governments are being forced to spend almost $300m more on roads than the Commonwealth Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is the case that road funding is describable in the way that Senator Calvert puts it, the explanation that I would offer is that the funding is proportionately lower now because we have spent so much money, and we have spent it so effectively and so much better than our predecessors did who wound down so dramatically the proportion of funding that was being devoted to national roads and highways. It is simply not necessary to spend the same amount of money as it was in our earlier years of government. No doubt, my colleague Mr Robert Brown is full bottle on this matter as always.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the South African Government has announced the suspension for a month of a Johannesburg English language newspaper, the Weekly Mail. The suspension was made under the draconian censorship laws which exist in that country and which are aimed squarely at gagging the media. They are laws which have been used to stifle other newspapers critical of the Government, including the Catholic New Nation, whose editor is currently being held in detention without trial. These developments offer ample rebuttal to those apologists for South Africa who are so often reminded these days to claim that the situation in that country is improving, that somehow there is some greater evidence of sensitivity to the abomination of apartheid than was the case previously. Manifestly that is not so and, here again, is living proof and evidence of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government deplores the harassment of the Weekly Mail. It is a respected newspaper which is well known for its depth of coverage of events in South Africa, including human rights issues, for its balance and for its integrity. The gagging of press freedom in South Africa will not make that country's political problems go away. What is needed is not less information but more open debate, and genuine freedom of expression, so that the ongoing conflict in that country can be resolved by peaceful political means.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins is correct. This matter has been going on for a long time. In fact, I wrote to Senator Jenkins about the matter on 18 November 1987. I pointed out in that letter that on 21 August 1984 Mr Ritter was arrested by the Australian Federal Police and charged with offences under section 39 of the Export Market Development Grants Act. Following a jury trial, which was held in February 1986, he was found guilty on four counts of attempting to obtain a grant that was not payable, and sentenced to a total of three years imprisonment, the non-parole period being 18 months. Mr Ritter appealed to the Western Australian Full Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction which appeal was unanimously dismissed on 5 August 1986. Mr Ritter subsequently sought leave to appeal to the High Court. I said in that letter to Senator Jenkins that in all the circumstances I believed that if Mr Ritter and others wanted a review of the case the best course would be for Mr Ritter to pursue his formal legal options to finality by continuing with his application for leave to appeal. Such a course would necessarily also involve a review by his own counsel of the evidence, the information Mr Ritter has available, and the cases which have already been held.</PARA></TALK.START>

Encouraging the use of alternative transport fuels is one part of the Government's policy response to the challenges arising from the decline in domestic production of liquid fuels which is expected over the period to the year 2000. Australia, as honourable senators would know, has large resources of natural gas which provide a major potential source for alternative transport fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Natural gas as a direct substitute for gasoline and diesel is receiving from us the highest priority because of its short term potential. We also attach a very high priority to research, development and demonstration of other alternative transport fuels such as methanol. Australia is also well advanced on the technology needed to use natural gas as a transport fuel. Last week the first international conference on natural gas vehicles was held in Sydney. Indeed, I understand that on Friday of this week a Trans-Perth bus, that is a bus that takes passengers around metropolitan Perth which is fitted with natural gas fuel injection, will be available in Canberra for inspection. Last week through the Department I announced a package of eight grants totalling $2.65m for projects on natural gas in transport. Those projects are aimed at further developing the technology and demonstrating it to a wide range of potential users. I am particularly pleased at the level of contributions from the private sector and from State governments for the recipients of these grants of some $6.4m, making an all-up total of $9.05m which will be spent on this sort of research. It gives me confidence that the technology we are developing in Australia will lead quickly to tangible results. Increased use of natural gas also has significant environmental benefits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 October Senator Alston asked me a series of questions about Australian assistance to Afghanistan in which reference was made to a $20,000 contribution to the Australian Red Cross Society to assist in providing the services of an Australian surgical nurse for a Red Cross hospital treating war victims in Kabul, Afghanistan. He asked me to explain on what possible basis my predecessor had claimed that the hospital would be open without discrimination to all those wounded in the present conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can confirm that the Government has provided these funds and, after initial difficulties in getting the operation under way, the hospital commenced operations on 1 October 1988 with the services of Sister Margaret Staff of Wodonga, Victoria. I can also inform Senator Alston that the hospital is being run solely by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); that the ICRC has a written understanding, in the form of an exchange of letters with the authorities in Kabul, about the operations of the hospital; that the ICRC regards patients seeking treatment at the hospital as under its protection and therefore entitled to return whence they came unimpeded; and that although ICRC would not refuse to treat any wounded person who arrived at the hospital, ICRC expects that combatants from either side would be treated elsewhere. The ICRC has advised that so far only civilian war wounded have arrived seeking treatment.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Alston also asked me whether it was a fact that the Government did not expect to spend any of its $20m contribution, which has been allocated to phase one of the United Nations returnee program for Afghan refugees, in the current financial year. I would like to reiterate that, on the information currently available to us from the United Nations and other sources, there are good prospects that Afghan refugees will start returning en masse in the next northern spring, around April 1989. Accordingly, subject to satisfactory coordination of international arrangements for the resettlement program, we expect to start spending our $20m contribution to the returnees program this financial year. As Senator Alston may recall, the original announcement of Australia's contribution indicated that the funds would be provided for the first two years of a UN resettlement program.</PARA>
<PARA> I did not say in my answer on 18 October in so many words, and I certainly did not intend to say, that we shall spend all of our $20m contribution by June next year, but I do acknowledge that the words I used may have conveyed that impression. The reality of the situation is that phase one of the UN returnees program is envisaged to cover the first two years of operations. Our funding is likely to be drawn down during this period, commencing around March 1989, and may therefore extend over three of our financial years.</PARA>

Australia's position is that we are encouraged that the Soviet Government is taking a more tolerant approach to the legitimate aspirations of the Baltic peoples. The convening in October of congresses of the popular movements in each of the Baltic republics without official opposition is a positive indication of this approach, but clearly there is a long way to go before these aspirations are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports the right of minority and ethnic groups to use non-violent means in pursuit of legitimate rights.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the report of the Australian Electoral Commission dealing with election funding and financial disclosure related to the last general election. The report highlights the complexity of the public funding system which was introduced by this Government-a system which is opposed by the coalition and which the coalition parties have indicated will be terminated on our return to government. The report shows that expenditure of over $10.2m was incurred by way of payments in the nature of public funding for the last Federal election. That $10.2m, together with the $40m which was spent on the referendum campaign, represents the sort of expenditure which the Opposition parties believe should well have been applied to purposes other than for the promotion of the Government's own particular partisan political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to examine the report and the number of instances in which the Electoral Commission has cause to draw attention to the failures of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to observe the proper principles established under the Electoral Act and under that section which deals with public funding. For instance, we read at paragraph 3.11:</PARA>
<PARA>Two branches of the Australian Labor Party had to be reminded that parliamentarians' levies were required to be reported unless the branch's rules provided that such levies were to be used for non-Commonwealth election purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Two branches of the very party which introduced the system had to be formally reminded of their reporting obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 6.26 criticism is made of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for failure to provide a return as required under the Act for advertising which took place during the prescribed period of the election between the issue of the writ and the date of the election-advertising which was designed to promote what was alleged to be the Government's achievements in Aboriginal affairs from 1983 to 1987. One sees from paragraph 6.29 that advertisements were placed in regard to Medicare and that the author was taken to task for failing to provide returns to the Commission because the advertising relating to the Medicare system and the Medicare rebate was properly taken to constitute electoral advertising for the purposes of this Act. It is apparent that, just as we have seen the whole animals fiasco in terms of the National Media Liaison Service, here the Electoral Commission is drawing attention to the fact that there was advertising during the election period out of public funds by the Government in relation to Medicare and to Aboriginal affairs which it did not properly disclose to the Electoral Commission. The Commission recommends a change to the law so that video promotional material is also made subject to the disclosure provisions of section 309 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report, in paragraph 3.25, refers to the notorious Harris-Daishowa donation and to the fact that charges have been laid against Mr Stephen Loosley, the agent of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Because this matter is pending before the courts and will be heard in April 1989, I believe that it would not be proper for me to go into the details. The matter is before the judicial authorities at the moment, but I draw attention to the fact that the ALP in this document is criticised for two branches failing to comply with the provisions of the Act, for two Government departments or authorities failing to put in returns in accordance with the Act, and for one of the most senior servants of the ALP now being charged with serious breaches of the Act. This report clearly demonstrates the extent to which the ALP is prepared to rort the electoral system and the Act, to make use of public funding provisions in the way in which it made use of the public purse to promote its referendum campaign. This report from the Australian Electoral Commission draws the attention of the people of Australia to the Labor Party's attitude to the conduct of fair and decent elections. It is a condemnation of the Labor Party's approach to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, to the observance of its own Act, and the cavalier disregard which it has for the duties which lie upon it and its servants in the electoral system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on election funding and financial disclosure by the Australian Electoral Commission makes very interesting reading. The overall impression one has from reading the report is nothing like the one that Senator Puplick put in his remarks. The report shows that the system is working well and that the number of problems is remarkably small, given the very large number of people involved in the exercise, from the point of view of not only those people standing as electoral candidates but also those people who are required under the Act to furnish publication details, details of advertisements, time considerations and the like. In terms of the very small number of legal actions required, which were the subject of selected reading by Senator Puplick, the Liberal and National parties seem to me from a reading of the report to loom just as large as the Australian Labor Party but he mentioned none of those matters. The only major political party in this place that does not get a mention is the Australian Democrats, and I am thankful for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In acknowledging the difficulties in this area, my overall impression is how fair and diligent the members of all political parties are in seeking to abide by their legislative obligations under the Act. Those obligations are fairly extensive, as those honourable senators who are familiar with the legislation know. I sat on the committee which drew up these proposals and which amended them twice, and I am very cognisant of the large amount of pressure on officials of political parties to follow the complexities of the law-complexities which are necessary. One is thankful that the proposals are working so well, and enjoy such a large amount of compliance as to require only a small number of prosecutions. Many cases have not gone forward to prosecution because of lack of evidence, or where something has been proven-for example, in regard to a couple of the items mentioned in the report relating to the 1984 election-essentially the judges have judged the breach of the Act to be so minor as to merit the imposition of a very small fine or good behaviour bond. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential element of the public funding exercise can be seen from the current United States presidential election, particularly in regard to those areas that are outside the public funding exercise in that country. Essentially one needs to be a millionaire to engage in the political process in that country. On every occasion that I have had the chance to have discussions with United States senators and members and members of other legislatures within the United States, an item arises on which they say they are fearful for the future of their democracy because of the vast amounts of money which are required to be able to participate within that democracy. I hope that Australia never reaches that situation. That is why it is very important that this type of procedure in Australia in terms of public funding of political parties, which provides the backbone of Australia's political life, is seen to be a fair and reasonable means of containing those enormous costs and not allowing vast moneyed special interest groups to buy the government of their choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to make any partisan comments in this debate on the report of the Australian Electoral Commission on election funding and financial disclosure. I intended to pursue the line that was essentially pursued by Senator Macklin, first in congratulating the Australian Electoral Commission on the excellent job it does and to note how well the system is working in protecting our democracy. But the rather petty and pathetic attempt by Senator Puplick to read a few selected clauses into the record in the hope that he might create the misapprehension that in some way such rorts are perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party has provoked me to make a few other comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the record, I state that the only person who has been prosecuted under the Act is an official of the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory. It is under investigation again. The report also refers to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, the Queensland National Party and the Western Australian Liberal Party. I had time to read only a few pages of the report once Senator Puplick started to make his unfortunate and unwarranted remarks. Of course, his comments about Medicare were 180 degrees wrong. I assume that he will apologise to Medicare when he discovers that he was wrong because he is literate enough to be able to read the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have in Australia for the first time an electoral funding system that is fair and reasonable, and the parties opposite do not like it. They are so used to having had 83 years of unchallenged advantage and privilege that they do not like the fact that suddenly electoral funding is reasonably fair. I am not surprised that they are trying to undermine it; I am not surprised that they are proposing changes to it. It is what I would expect would occur. Their principles do not extend to giving back the $5m of taxpayers' money that they received under the Act. I would not expect that to occur. It is called double standards, but who is surprised? People say one thing and act in another way. I am not allowed to use the word that describes people who say one thing and act in another way because it is unparliamentary, but it is what they do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to mount an attack on the Liberal Party's administration of its finances. Overwhelmingly, it has been found to have acted properly. But anybody who represents the New South Wales Liberal Party in this place and who talks to us about the propriety of electoral funding takes saying one thing and acting in another way to new heights. In the last New South Wales State election the New South Wales Liberal Party, on its own admission, took liberties with the law and liberties with propriety and proper practices to new heights. It is tearing itself apart because some of its officers had the temerity to express some demur about the abuse of the public purse and the misuse of taxpayers' money that has taken place. I know that Senator Puplick is very concerned about his preselection, but it seems to me that he has taken that concern a little too far in this case. I hope we do not have a contribution from Senator Bishop in the interests of equal time. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that when somebody like Senator Puplick carries on in the way in which he has, he diverts attention from the fundamental fact, which is that Australians can be very proud. They have an electoral system that is free of corruption, a fair electoral system. Overwhelmingly, everybody acts fairly. Overwhelmingly, everybody acts honestly. With only one possible exception-I do not refer to my party-any mistakes that have taken place have concerned oversights, minor procedural problems and a misunderstanding of what is a relatively new system. I am not trying to score cheap points. I am trying to say that we have a system that we can value. It is never advantaged by selective interpretation, pathetic attempts and errors, in the way in which Senator Puplick went on. I believe that nobody advances the cause of Australian democracy by using this opportunity to make cheap attempts to score points. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to be proud of the way in which our political parties operate. I am proud of the way in which the Labor Party operates. I think that the representatives of the other parties in this place overwhelmingly are entitled to be proud of the way in which their parties operate. Our democracy is a valuable thing. We are here to uphold it, not to score cheap points at its expense. I regret that Senator Puplick-who so often speaks in ways with which I agree-should have done so today. I hope that none of his colleagues follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by congratulating the Australian Electoral Commission on its fair and reasonable conduct of elections. I welcome the fact that Australia continues to have such a cherished democracy which is enhanced by a fair electoral funding system. </PARA>

The Australian Electoral Commission certainly does, and it is reported here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another area touched on by Senator Puplick concerned expenditures by a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. That matter has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That occurred on 2 October 1987. Having been requested months earlier to provide a return, on 18 January 1988 the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs eventually furnished a return to the Australian Electoral Commissioner. The fact is that no return was submitted and the Government pretended there was no need for a return to be furnished, even though the Electoral Commissioner reported that this clearly fell within the definition of `electoral matter' set out in the Act and the Commission sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether the Minister or the Secretary of the Department was the appropriate person to furnish a return. The question of prosecution was then referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that public money-taxpayers' money-was deliberately diverted by a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for what the Electoral Commissioner says was clearly an electoral matter. The Attorney-General's Department confirmed this in October last year. It was another three months before the former Minister reluctantly came clean. I would like to know, of course, how much taxpayers' money was spent by way of deliberate contributions to the Australian Labor Party's funds by a Minister of the Crown in a way which breaches the law. That is the simple problem. I want to know what has happened to the request to the Director of Public Prosecutions for information as to what is to be done about that deliberate breach of the electoral law by a Minister. Once again, the Labor Party has been revealed with its fingers in the till of the public purse. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that this year's Steel Industry Authority report is relatively optimistic, despite the major problems experienced by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) earlier in the year. Raw steel production fell over the year by almost 6 per cent, due mainly to plant commissioning problems and equipment failures at Port Kembla and Newcastle, but the Authority expresses optimism about the recovery in production in the second half of the year. Productivity averaged 267 tonnes per employee per annum compared with 270 tonnes in the previous year and 288 tonnes in 1985-86. BHP is proposing to increase productivity by shedding about 3,500 employees by December of this year. Industrial disputes were lower-I think this is one of the most welcome things in the report-dropping to a little over 69,000 man hours lost compared with 426,000 in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter worthy of note in this final period of the steel industry plan is that there do remain significant problems-not just the production problems I have referred to but also significant delivery problems as well as ongoing quality problems. Senator Button conceded in Estimates committee hearings that there was significant room for improvement in quality. The report points out that there has been a marked deterioration in BHP's delivery performance because of the production difficulties which have caused disruption of the operations of many downstream users of steel products, and poor delivery performance is continuing in the current year as production levels have worsened. In addition, the report notes:</PARA>
<PARA>While some steel consumers advised the Authority during its Review of the Plan that problems with regard to quality remain, the upgraded facilities at Port Kembla, Newcastle and CPD's plants has, and will continue, to generate improvements in productivity across BHP's product range. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see those matters acknowledged in the report because I must say that the anecdotal evidence one gets from frequent visits to industry is of a fairly high degree of dissatisfaction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, from the letters and the various communications we get from industry obviously all is not as it should be. The lesson which has to be drawn from this by the Government and indeed by the Opposition and people in the industry is that there is no substitute for permitting competition if we are to have the sort of development of manufacturing industry that is desired by all sides in this Parliament. On 3 August 1988 the Australian Financial Review referred to an inability to deliver steel on time, and some say to a satisfactory level of quality, and suggested that that was having major repercussions in the manufacturing industry. I just wish to say in the brief time one has to comment on these reports that it is extremely important for Australia that the very considerable efforts which have been made by BHP and which are reflected in the considerable capital investment it has undertaken over the last five years and its considerable attempts to improve industrial relations, training and communications-things which are evident when one visits BHP plants-be translated into a far higher standard of service to Australian manufacturers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with the report, which says that there needs to be sustained efforts to improve industrial relations. It would be unfair to say that all of the difficulties in that area lie with BHP. Certainly in discussions I have had with representatives of steel industry unions it is clear that significant attitudinal change is still needed within some elements of the trade union movement, although there has been a good deal of movement over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry is very important to Australia. It is an industry in which we enjoy enormous natural advantages in terms of our resources of both iron ore and coal. We should be a world beater in steel production. In some respects we are, but the sort of complaints touched on in this report and to which I have referred are complaints which we should not be hearing at this late period of the steel industry plan. I believe we should proceed without the benefits of a plan from this point, but with a clear indication from all sides of politics that we will encourage the most competitive market possible for steel products in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comment made by Senator Chaney that the annual report of the Steel Industry Authority is an optimistic one. But it is optimistic in relation to what has happened in the past. If we compare what it says with the performance of our near neighbours, it is far from optimistic. In fact, it should be a source of great concern to almost every Australian. I want to repeat some of the figures mentioned by Senator Chaney. Australia's raw steel production last year was 5.7 million tonnes, we employed 30,783 people in the industry and we had a productivity level of 267 tonnes of raw steel per employee. In industrial disputes 69,462 man hours were lost. No-one can be proud of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a big improvement on the previous year, I agree, but recently I visited the newest steelworks in Korea-after all, we are part of the same region and steel is an international commodity these days-and I could not help draw the conclusion from the state of the art steelworks in Korea that the Koreans apply the same sort of efficiency to their industries as they applied to their handling of the Olympic Games. We all realise what a wonderful job they did with the Olympics. To give just one example, the Pohang Iron and Steel Co. is the third largest producer in the world, having come from a zero position 15 years ago. So in 15 years the Koreans have gone from zero to being the third largest producer in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> To produce 5.4 million tonnes at Kwangyang Bay, 4,500 people are employed. We employed 30,783 people to produce 5.7 million tonnes of raw steel. Is it any wonder that we have problems in this country? Our productivity of 267 tonnes per employee is a slight fall on last year, although it is certainly an improvement since the steel plan came into effect, but it compares with a productivity level at Kwangyang Bay of around 1,000 to 1,200 tonnes of steel per man. Senator Button is leaving; he should go to Korea and have a look. Even though I appreciate what he has tried to do with the steel industry, he is playing around with paper clips when Australia is compared to places like Korea and Japan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite correct. One would think that with the years of experience we have had we would be up with the state of the art, but again I make the remark that although our productivity has improved when compared with the rest of the world it is a disaster. Industrial disputation in the steel industry caused the loss of 69,462 man hours last year. My understanding is that at the Posco works there was no industrial disputation. In the section on future developments, it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Authority concluded that the progress made by the Australian steel industry since the early 1980s has enhanced its ability to meet the challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>I question that because I think that even Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, though it may not admit it, has recognised the fact that it is all just too hard, no matter what it spends. It has spent a lot of money, I understand some $600m since the steel industry plan came into effect. I read in a newspaper yesterday that it has agreed to go into a fifty-fifty joint venture in Thailand, involving a $1.6m investment in the new steel plant to be built there. I am not surprised that it has done that because when one looks at the productivity of Taiwan, Korea, and now the emerging country of Thailand, there is no doubt that unless there are dramatic improvements within the steel industry in Australia there is no way in the world we will be competitive. That is a great shame because, as Senator Chaney mentioned, we have great resources of coal and iron ore. People from other countries ask us how they are producing all this steel while we are the source of their raw materials. It is a good question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to congratulate elements of the steel industry employees who have conducted themselves properly and rationally under the steel industry plan in recent times, particularly in Newcastle and Whyalla. However, I note that at Port Kembla the industrial lesson has still to be learnt. Around 75 per cent of industrial disputes in the steel industry took place in Port Kembla, according to the Steel Industry Authority report, but only about half the steel in Australia is produced there. The industrial relations at Port Kembla are somehow different from the rest of Australia. It is the same employer but it is a different faction of the union that is in charge in Port Kembla. I think it is clearly evident that despite the employer's enormous endeavours, which have been so successful in other parts of the steel industry around Australia, the situation in Port Kembla is still atrociously bad because of the leadership of that faction of the union movement in the Wollongong area, which has yet to learn a sense of responsibility concomitant with its duties under the steel industry plan to provide work. After all, the management is providing massively increased expenditure in new plant and equipment and all the unions had to provide was genuine and conscientious work. They have done so in other centres but not in Port Kembla.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for calling the quorum to enable me to come in to speak on this report and I apologise for any inconvenience I have caused. I understood that the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges was to report prior to its being handed down so I thought we would have a series of speeches before this item came on. I thank the Chairman of the Committee for her courtesy to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not a lot that I wish to say about this report, except that it is a matter of very great disappointment to me that the technique which was adopted very successfully by Senator Collins in this place effectively prevented the issue which I sought originally to have put before the Privileges Committee from being determined. Honourable senators might recall that the matter was originally raised by me on the basis of a specific complaint about the action of ex-Premier Burke being referred to the Privileges Committee. The actions related to the threat of legal proceedings by ex-Premier Burke to a citizen who had circulated a petition, resulting in the withdrawal of the petition and the payment of costs by the citizen concerned. It was a difficult matter which raised the question of conflicting principles-the principle that a person's reputation is entitled to protection and gets that protection from the law of defamation as against the right of a citizen to petition the Parliament. In my speeches when I was seeking the reference of this matter I made it clear that I thought there were competing principles and it was a difficult issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins, having listened to the Australian Democrats' speeches, very cleverly moved an amendment which sent off a general inquiry and I specifically raised in the Senate the fact that this would prevent the examination of the particular matter. I remind the Senate that when we were debating it we had statements from a number of people. I shall quote from Senator Robert Ray, and Senator Macklin for the Australian Democrats, to illustrate how it was thought that we might get a quite different approach from that which the Committee chose to adopt. For example, Senator Robert Ray said that he did not want the inquiry to go ahead. In Hansard of 16 March 1988 on page 816 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if it does go ahead, I will not be bitterly disappointed. I look forward to Mr Strickland coming to give evidence. I hope he is truthful; I have no reason to believe otherwise. I want him to give evidence and I want questions to be asked. I will not be able to ask them because I am not on the Committee, but I hope someone will. </PARA>
<PARA>He listed the things that he wanted to hear about this incident. More importantly though, when one looks at how the Australian Democrats reacted to the amendment moved by Senator Collins, one finds Senator Macklin making it clear that he believed that there would be an approach by the Committee which involved its calling evidence from that relevant party. I had already pointed out in the Senate that I did not think Senator Collins's amendment was the best way of ensuring that the Privileges Committee looked at the real difficulties which the particular case raised. I said that it would be far too easy on a generalised reference to take the simple view that if something was defamatory it should not be circulated. That is far too neat for the issues raised in the present case. We have a situation which requires that we ensure that somebody is not denied his rights to come to this Parliament by the use of the threat of legal proceedings which economics preclude being determined by the courts. I put very squarely before the Senate that that was the danger of this approach. Senator Macklin responded on that and answered my point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I note that his motion did not require the Standing Committee of Privileges to call either Strickland or Burke. In fact, the Committee can do what it likes. It would be very odd not to have them called, I admit, but it would have no obligation and no requirement to call them. In fact, it would not even have a requirement to tell them that a hearing was being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA>That is his reference to the original motion I had moved-that there was no specific obligation on the Committee to call Strickland or Burke. Senator Macklin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the members of the Committee have been sitting in the chamber throughout the entire debate and are very much aware of what the issues are. I believe it would be very odd to go into a general inquiry without looking at that specific item. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the attitude adopted by the Australian Democrats. What happened is that when the Committee sat-all this is contained in the report-Senator Teague moved that the Committee of Privileges invite Mr R. M. Strickland to appear before the Committee. Senator Durack and Senator Teague voted in favour of that. Senator Giles, Senator Childs, Senator Coates and Senator Powell of the Australian Democrats voted against it. So, the particular issue was not dealt with. The questions that Senator Ray suggested might be asked of Mr Strickland could not be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> What this enabled the majority of the Committee to do was to avoid completely the issue which I raised in the Senate. I did not raise the issue that there should be some general justification of the circulation of defamatory material under the guise of a petition. I raised the issue of what the position is if a citizen of limited means circulates a proper petition but is pushed off course by the threat of legal proceedings from a person with a much longer pocket, someone who is richer. I suggested to the Senate that we should be concerned about protecting the rights of citizens. I admitted that there was a conflict of two principles, but I said that it was worth examining how those principles ought to work and that the Committee of Privileges was the appropriate body to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the fast footwork of Senator Collins. I make no imputation against him in using that expression. He very cleverly diverted this matter from an examination of a particular and difficult point which gave rise to the issue I have just described into a general inquiry. The Committee then chose not to deal with the complexity of the issue which had been raised. I very much regret that. This is one of those occasions when I express my personal disappointment at the performance of the Senate and at the attitude of the majority of the Committee. I think it is true that in an increasingly complex society it is more and more difficult for the ordinary man or woman, the person of limited means, to raise a case against the powerful. This is a matter which, I would have thought, would have brought forward the natural concerns of members of the Australian Labor Party who once were concerned with such matters. But I think that in this case party politics have triumphed and the issue simply has not been dealt with by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have considered whether there is some alternative action that I can take. I do not believe that there is. But I say, in particular to the Australian Democrats and Senator Powell, who is in this chamber at the moment, that it is a matter of enormous disappointment to me that she did not follow the very reasonable approach which was adopted by Senator Macklin when he supported the Collins amendment. I believe that she was, therefore, a party to ensuring that this matter was not properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not mind Mr Strickland being put to the test. Mr Strickland sought some advice from me and he got it, as any constituent would have got it. There were inferences and suggestions that he was not bona fide. That could have been put to the test. All I say is that he has not had his day in court. He did not get his day in court when the ex-Premier threatened him with legal action, because he could not afford it. He did not get his day in court here because we took a partisan attitude to a matter which I think should have been dealt with quite differently. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, as a long time defender of the Senate and as somebody who has opposed constitutional amendments which I believed would have diminished the standing and capacity of the Senate to do its job, this is one of those occasions when I am not proud of the Senate at all. I thought it was a very second rate performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In closing this debate I would like to recapitulate a few of the circumstances which brought this matter before the Senate in the first place. The petition which was the genesis of the whole reference effectively questioned the fitness of the ex-Premier of Western Australia to be appointed to the position, which he now holds with distinction, of Ambassador to Ireland and to the Holy See. However, as Senator Chaney has explained, this was not the question which was before the Committee of Privileges to determine. The Committee had the benefit of the wisdom of the Senate in the course of the debate which resulted in the reference that came to us. The Committee had the responsibility of determining just how that reference would be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We dealt with the matter without acrimony. Although there was a minority report, it was a thoughtful report. The majority of the Committee believed that it was mistaken. We agreed to differ in the best tradition of the Senate, without any histrionics or ill-feeling. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when the Committee reported on the last night of sitting in the provisional Parliament House, to find that we came under quite vicious attack from Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I seriously considered asking for Senator Chaney to be called to order for the intemperance of his criticism of the Privileges Committee and the way in which we had carried out the reference. It is not surprising that Senator Chaney rejected the conclusion of the Committee, but for him to be so critical of the manner of our deliberations seemed to me to be bordering on the unparliamentary. His language again this afternoon has been somewhat pushing the bounds of the conventions, at least, of this chamber. Our last night of sitting in the provisional Parliament House was not one for recrimination. Once again, the agile wit of Senator Collins helped good humour to be retrieved, and good sense prevailed. The closing stages of those sittings of the Senate were conducted with a considerable amount of tolerance and a capacity to work together which so often characterise this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had the option of dealing with the principle involved which certainly was the matter before us, and which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whether the circulation of a petition containing defamatory material for the purpose of gaining signatures and subsequent submission to the Senate is or ought to be privileged and how such issues should be determined and in what forum. </PARA>
<PARA>It had the option of doing a case study of the incident which engendered the reference. It had the option of doing both. The debate in the Senate, as Senator Chaney has quite correctly observed, canvassed the way in which the matter might be dealt with. It is gratuitous, however, for any member of the Senate to assert that a debate of that nature should be taken as part of the reference, as it were, that was before us, which seems to me to be the position which Senator Chaney has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the submissions that we received addressed the principle, taking the view that the principle was the matter that should be dealt with. But more importantly, the majority of the Committee was persuaded by the fact that the Senate, given the choice of supporting the original motion, which would have been the study of that particular case, or Senator Collins's amendment, had opted for the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps a case study would have provided a more compelling theatrical performance, a three-ring circus, with lots of press attention and endless telephoto opportunities for various members of the Senate. But the Committee, in its wisdom, decided that the substance of the question was worthy of serious consideration-that it was of considerable importance-without the distraction of partisan politics and colourful personalities to the extent that this was possible, and ably assisted by the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, I believe that we produced a useful and non-partisan report which makes a contribution to the specialised field of privileges law. A number of those who have taken part in subsequent debate in the Senate have mentioned that previously privileges law has been based on cases. I do not believe that that fact makes any difference to the value of our report. The way in which we dealt with this matter of principle was totally correct. It produced a well thought out and well expressed report, one that has received a considerable amount of favourable attention. I believe that the conduct of the Committee was totally correct. I believe that to question that conduct is totally beyond the bounds of Senate convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish this debate on a very positive note. As I have said before, the conduct of the Committee itself was positive and constructive. The Committee dealt with the substance of the matter that was before it in an honourable and effective way. I would like to pay tribute to those people who were involved in the Committee and who made the report the useful precedent that I believe it is. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report arises from a responsibility imposed upon Senate committees by clause (18) of resolution 1 of the resolutions of the Senate concerning parliamentary privileges carried on 25 February 1988, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a committee has any reason to believe that any person has been improperly influenced in respect of evidence which may be given before the committee, or has been subjected to or threatened with penalty or injury in respect of any evidence given, the committee shall take all reasonable steps to ascertain the facts of the matter. Where the committee considers that the facts disclose that a person may have been improperly influenced or subjected to or threatened with a penalty or injury in respect of evidence which may be or has been given before the committee, the committee shall report the facts and its conclusions to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Although this has been a difficult matter, I believe that all the Committee members-there were representatives from the four parties-took their responsibilities with regard to this matter very seriously, and I am pleased that eventually we have come forward with a unanimous report. But I must say that that unanimity was not easily achieved. I understand that this is the first time that a matter has come before the Senate arising from this resolution. I want to explain briefly how I, as Chairman of the Committee, saw our role, and I think this is a view that was accepted by the Committee as a whole. I saw our role as conducting a preliminary examination of the matter to determine whether an arguable case existed. I do not want to be excessively legalistic in this matter but I think that was the approach we took, and, as the resolution states, we then had to report to the Senate. I saw the purpose of our exercise-and I think the Committee as a whole did-as assisting the Senate, and in particular Mr President, in the task of determining whether a matter should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. We dealt with the matter by looking at written material-and we would have looked at other sorts of records had they been available-but not by calling witnesses. We did not believe that it was appropriate that there should be, in effect, two privileges inquiries into this matter-one by the Senate Select Committee and, if we so concluded, a subsequent inquiry by the Privileges Committee itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I am concerned about some parts of the conclusions that the Committee has come to, and I will make some comments about the nature of the precedent that they might create, I believe that it would have been worse to have had a partisan division in the Committee in regard to this matter or to have left the way open for allegations that Government senators were endeavouring to conduct some sort of cover-up. Although this report in itself is a fairly minor document, it occurs within the context of some major controversy taking place in related areas and, therefore, it is relevant that we should be cognisant of that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some brief comments on the merits of the matter. There were two separate questions that the Committee had to deal with relating to two witnesses that came before it. The matters are related politically but they are not related in terms of their substance for potential consideration by the Privileges Committee and for the consideration of this report. The second in time sequence but the first in terms of the consideration of the Committee and the presentation of the report relates to Mrs Shirley McPherson, who is called by the quaint name of Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). On 2 September she came before the Committee as a witness and, although she indicated on that occasion that she was Chairman of that Commission, she appeared as an individual and that was made clear to everybody present. At a subsequent ADC Board meeting on 10 October a resolution of no confidence was carried. That is outlined in the report. The relevant extract in paragraph 12 refers to Mrs McPherson making public comments, notwithstanding a resolution of the Commission which required her to notify the Commission prior to making public statements. I think this indicates quite clearly the confusion that underpins the subsequent actions of the ADC which led to the need for this report. The resolution of the ADC Board of 23 May, which is referred to in that no confidence motion, does not refer to the question of prior notification at all; it refers to the requirement for prior approval of the Board of Commissioners before a submission or public statement is made. Of course, for the purposes of our consideration today there is a significant difference between notification and approval. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is a great deal of doubt that any organisation is entitled to require people to notify it about public statements they may be going to make. But it is entirely different to say that, before one proceeds, one has to seek the approval of this Board, particularly in the circumstances where it could be seen as limiting an individual's right to appear in an individual capacity. I think it is perfectly open to interpret the decision of the Commission as in no way intending to limit the rights of individuals, and it has subsequently indicated that that is what it meant. Nevertheless, it is an interpretation that is open. I am not aware of anybody saying that it is not the right of any organisation to require approval of any submission made in its name. Any organisation with which I have ever been associated would always require a report made in the name of that organisation to have the approval of the responsible body authorised to give such approval. But it would not indicate the right to limit my or, in this instance, Mrs McPherson's, right as an individual to appear as a witness before a Senate select committee. So it is open to being interpreted as improper interference in terms of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be no sufficient penalty or constraint involved in the actions concerned as to constitute substantial obstruction in terms of the resolutions of the Senate, nevertheless it is capable of some other interpretation. In fact, it is capable, as I have said, of quite straightforward explanation. The ADC's letter of 20 October referred to the resolution passed at the sixty-second Commission meeting, which it forwarded to the President and which Mr President tabled. It informed the Senate that the resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>was not intended to in any way encroach upon or limit the powers of the Senate or any Parliamentary Committee;</PARA>
<PARA>was not intended to prevent or in any way affect the right of individuals to appear before the Senate or such Committees;</PARA>
<PARA>was purely an administrative mechanism designed to ensure that papers and submissions presented on behalf of the ADC contained information that was accurate and reflected the views of the Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think it was a resolution carried after the event. Perhaps it is not such a surprising resolution for it to carry but it is a perfectly logical and straightforward explanation of how the circumstances could have arisen. The Committee had to accept the obvious fact that the sequence of events was capable of an interpretation which would lead to an arguable case of breach of privilege. Whether we thought it might have been a minor breach or a technical breach it was certainly an arguable case that it could have been a breach of privilege and therefore there was no difficulty in the Committee obtaining agreement that the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Brien's case was different. He appeared before the Committee as a witness some two months earlier on 19 July-ultimately as an individual. Although it is not relevant for the purposes of this discussion, he did seek at one stage to appear as the General Manager but that was subsequently not approved. He appeared, as I said, on 19 July. The ADC met on 22 July and no action was taken, although it must have been aware that Mr O'Brien had appeared as it was well publicised. The ADC met again in August and no action was taken in regard to Mr O'Brien's appearance. In October, at the third meeting after his appearance, Mr O'Brien was transferred to another position. Technically, he was transferred at the same level, to a position of equal rank, but I think-this is not a point we need to resolve for the purposes of this report-it is arguable that he suffered a penalty in the terms of the privileges resolution of this Parliament. I would not want to be called upon at this stage to make that determination, but it is an arguable proposition should it become relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is in my view, and I think in the view of my colleagues on this side of the House, no evidence at this stage of a link between Mr O'Brien's appearance before the Committee and the subsequent decision of the ADC. If my very vague recollection of the Latin saying is appropriate, it is what is called a post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy-because it followed something therefore it was caused by it. I do not believe that that argument has as yet been established. But there is a clear determination by some senators to pursue the matter and they put forward their arguments in a reasonable and cogent manner before the Committee. There was indeed an unsatisfactory-it might be described as a too smart by half reply-by the Aboriginal Development Commission in explaining the decision which it made which was of no assistance to the Committee in trying to resolve the matter. So on the basis of those two events, to ensure that not only is justice done but also it is seen to be done, at a meeting this morning the Committee unanimously agreed to refer the O'Brien matter as well to the Privileges Committee. I take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator Devlin for agreeing to that proposal. It was not easy for them, given their views on the question, which I think are similar to mine, but I appreciate their action on it. It led to a unanimous decision which was worth while and appropriate, and served the interests of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to say some things that might assist future committees in their consideration of similar matters. As I said, I understand that this is the first time a matter has come forward in this way by way of a committee exercising its responsibilities arising from the Senate's privileges resolution earlier this year. I think it would be the unanimous view of all senators, past and present, that privilege is a very serious matter. For citizens, referral of their actions to the Privileges Committee is a very substantial step, and not one that should be taken at whim or lightly. There should be at least some evidence before a committee refers a matter to the Privileges Committee for further examination. I am not proposing a change in the process. I believe the process on which we agreed is appropriate, that is, that we conduct only a preliminary inquiry, but the level of connection needs to be of sufficient substance to warrant a referral. I do not believe that citizens take lightly the question of having their actions referred to the Privileges Committee and I would never want to get to the situation where they might. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate that any future committee should look at our action and the statements that have been made about it and in some way interpret that it is appropriate to refer to the Privileges Committee matters so that the Committee might conduct some sort of fishing expedition just in case there is a bit of evidence floating around somewhere. I make those remarks while supporting the Committee's recommendations that both matters should be referred to the Privileges Committee. As I have said, I think the ADC letter of 20 October which I read to the Senate earlier sets the context in which this matter should best be examined. I suspect that it is probably more of a misunderstanding than anything else. But to ensure the very important protection of the privileges of this Parliament, to ensure that no-one is in any doubt that he cannot interfere with the right of any Australian citizen to appear before any parliamentary committee, the Committee recommends the referral. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs is not reporting today on the reference given to it by the Senate to investigate certain matters in relation to the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That report is due to be brought down on 23 February 1989. We are reporting now on certain matters which have occurred during the taking of evidence by the Select Committee. The issue was simply whether two witnesses who came before that Committee have been penalised subsequently in ways which constitute a breach of the privilege of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has set out in the report, which the Chairman of the Committee tabled a moment ago, the relevant statutory provisions which cover the protection of witnesses and which make certain behaviour towards witnesses an offence. It is not the function of the Select Committee to determine matters of privilege; rather the Committee is required by resolution of the Senate to make known to the Senate any occurrences which it thinks might constitute a breach of privilege. The Senate, as honourable senators know, altered its procedures last year and this is the first occasion on which a committee has reported on a matter as provided for under the new arrangements and therefore requiring appropriate action by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The function of the Standing Committee of Privileges is to inquire into and report upon complaints of privilege which may be referred to it by the Senate. It is to the Committee of Privileges that this matter will go for determination. I do not intend to try to determine it. It is common ground within the Select Committee that certain matters in relation to the treatment of Mrs Shirley McPherson should be referred to the Privileges Committee for determination and report. The Chairman has outlined what they are and I hope that such a reference will be made. It is in relation to the treatment of Mr Mick O'Brien, also a witness before the Select Committee, that opinions vary. The Liberal and National party senators and the Australian Democrats senators believe that there is sufficient doubt about the treatment of Mr O'Brien by the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission to justify his matter being referred to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Government senators have agreed to this course of action being taken as the Chairman has set out and the Committee has so recommended. I believe that the case in relation to Mr O'Brien is stronger than would have been indicated by the Chairman in his remarks a moment ago. The facts are that Mr O'Brien gave evidence to the Select Committee and that he provided documents which were prepared under a delegation he held. They were documents which had been approved by the Chairperson, Mrs Shirley McPherson. The facts are that these were challenged by certain acting commissioners and that they were withdrawn. Later, Mr O'Brien was removed from his position as General Manager of the ADC and transferred to a new and artificial position in a process which itself is now the subject of legal proceedings. It is a fact that Mr O'Brien is now on special leave, that he is unlikely to return to the ADC and that these are all matters for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend further to refer to the matters which may be the subject of legal action. We assert that, on balance, the commissioners of the ADC, most of them acting commissioners, link Mick O'Brien and Shirley McPherson in their criticisms. We further assert that they were furious with them both for appearing before the Senate Select Committee, that they dealt with Shirley McPherson one way and with Mick O'Brien another way. The real reason, we believe, for removing Mick O'Brien from the job of General Manager of the ADC was to punish him, inter alia, for appearing before the Senate Select Committee. We asked the ADC for an explanation of the move. The explanation, a copy of which is attached to our report, was in Public Service jargon. It answered nothing and it was an insult. I believe that Mick O'Brien still has much important evidence to give to the Select Committee whose work is far from complete. He can only give evidence, as can Shirley McPherson, if the Senate in turn gives to them the protection they require and deserve against crude reprisals. It is necessary that Mr Mick O'Brien's matter also be referred to the Privileges Committee for its attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I observe that an apology like that sent to us by the ADC in relation to Mrs McPherson in no way vitiates any original breach of privilege. As I said, this is the first time that the new Senate procedures have been used and will be tested. Many potential witnesses will watch the outcome closely. There are many Senate committees carrying out their tasks and many potential witnesses who have to make a decision as to whether it is proper and safe for them to offer themselves to give evidence before a Senate committee. Our duty is to offer protection and to respond to breaches; especially breaches against employees and individuals who have acted bravely and in the public interest. I commend the report of the Select Committee on this matter. I indicate that we hope that appropriate procedural steps will be taken by Mr President to ensure that both these matters go to the Committee of Privileges as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague, Senator Peter Baume, on this very important report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs entitled Protection of Witnesses. As the Senate will recall, last week the President of the Senate commissioned the Senate Committee to produce a report as to whether there was any breach of privilege in relation to two witnesses, Mrs McPherson and Mr O'Brien. It is important to note that the Committee has brought down a unanimous report although Senator McMullan has some slight differences with the report. Nevertheless, irrespective of Senator McMullan's comments in the Senate, the report was unanimous-agreed to by all the senators who were involved on that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee has agreed that both the Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), Mrs Shirley McPherson, and the General Manager, Mr Mick O'Brien, could have some penalty inflicted on them in retaliation for their appearance before the Senate Select Committee. In the case of Mrs McPherson, who is the Chairperson of the ADC, a motion of no confidence was moved against her at the meeting of the Aboriginal Development Commission which met in Adelaide on 10 to 14 October. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs McPherson appeared before the Senate Select Committee as a private individual. She made it very clear that her appearance before the Senate Select Committee was as an individual. Yet on 14 October at the Adelaide conference of the ADC a motion of no confidence was carried against Mrs McPherson. It began by saying that the Chairman appeared before the Senate Select Committee on 2 September 1988 and it then went on to other matters. That, I would have thought, could have been a breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator McMullan indicated, we unanimously agreed that that case of Mrs Shirley McPherson should be investigated by the Privileges Committee. At the same ADC meeting in Adelaide a resolution was also passed creating a Senior Executive Service (SES) level 3 position. A temporary position was established at an SES level. It was recommended that the current General Manager, Mr O'Brien, be placed in the created position forthwith. Mr Cedric Wyatt was to be transferred to the position of Acting General Manager. A decision to create a temporary SES level 2 position was taken and so forth. I will table that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that constituted a very similar case. Whereas on 14 October a vote of no confidence was passed in relation to Mrs McPherson, Mr O'Brien at the same meeting was removed from his official position. Mr O'Brien believed that he was wrongly dismissed or wrongly removed. He has taken legal action against this decision. The ADC also provided an explanation as to Mr O'Brien's transfer. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the Board regard Mr O'Brien as being the most suitably qualified ADC officer to discharge effectively the duties of the newly created position. This placement was considered by Members of the Board as a show of confidence in Mr O'Brien. </PARA>
<PARA>One could not get two more conflicting statements. Mr O'Brien believes he was denied natural justice by this move and the ADC said that he was given the carrot because he was the most qualified officer. That is a decision that the Privileges Committee must look into. It is not one that we on the Senate Select Committee were given the right from this Senate to investigate. We were merely asked by the Senate to establish whether there was a prima facie case to bring before the Privileges Committee. We believed that there was. On this side of the House the Australian Democrats, the Liberals and the Nationals believed that there was a case to answer. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 October 1988 Mrs McPherson, acting as chairwoman, in answer to a query from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Gerry Hand, told the Minister in writing that Mr O'Brien no longer held his position with the ADC. Yet I understand that Mr O'Brien is still the General Manager of the ADC. The matter of Mr O'Brien's sacking and reinstatement to his present position is absolutely confusing, to say the least. I understand that he has been sacked or removed-whichever term one likes to use-reinstated, replaced again, and at the moment he is on leave. This also is a matter that the Privileges Committee must investigate. I do not believe it is up to the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to establish whether Mr O'Brien was sacked, transferred or paid a penalty for appearing before the Committee. That is a matter for the Privileges Committee to establish, and it is my personal belief that the matter can be determined only by the Privileges Committee and by moving to ensure that Mr O'Brien's account of the events is fully available to the Senate and his rights in this matter fully protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated that we in the Senate are debating today a most serious matter, one of a type that rarely comes before the Senate, and I believe we have to be extremely cautious. We have to make sure that when people appear before a Senate committee to give evidence their position is absolutely protected. We in this Parliament represent the people of Australia and we, in turn, in the interests of public disclosure and public interest, must give those people who wish to give evidence the ultimate protection. I believe this cause can be served only if Mr O'Brien and Mrs McPherson have the right to have their case considered before the Privileges Committee. I also believe that this matter should be investigated with the utmost haste so that a conclusion can be reached by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up one item Senator McMullan mentioned. He dwelt considerably on the gravity of referring an item to the Privileges Committee, pointing out that this very significant step was not one to be taken lightly. I reinforce the remarks Senator Boswell has just made and point out that as this is the highest parliament in the land, as this Parliament has seen fit to set up Senate select committees and standing committees to investigate a wide range of matters of public importance, it is absolutely vital that those committees not be impeded in any way in the carrying out of their functions and that therefore there should be an absolute guarantee of protection for witnesses who appear before those committees. I would weigh against the matter of gravity Senator McMullan has raised the equally important matter of gravity of the protection of witnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just placing emphasis in a slightly different direction. I think this matter is of considerable importance. I think there is a prima facie case, as has been indicated by the two Opposition speakers so far. I think there is a sufficient case to answer in this matter with respect to Mr O'Brien and that his case should be referred to the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One item which greatly impressed me was the motion passed through the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) that witnesses appearing before Senate committees-in one case the wording was `should notify the Commission of their intention to give evidence' and on another occasion the wording was `should obtain the permission of the members of the Commission'. If the wording had been restricted to giving evidence as officers or employees or members of the Commission I could find no fault with it, but it did not contain those words. So on the face of it, the passage of that motion through the ADC may well constitute a breach of privilege because it could constrain witnesses appearing before a Senate committee as private citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been indicated, the two witnesses at issue appeared both as public witnesses and as private witnesses. If the action the ADC took against those two persons was in relation to their appearing in their capacity as private witnesses, it seems to me that that clearly is a matter which falls before the Privileges Committee and quite rightly should be so referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a comment about the context in which the Aboriginal Development Commission took the action which brought this matter to the attention of the Parliament. I refer to the original resolution that was carried at the main meeting of the newly appointed Commission relating to its servants or officers making public statements that clearly related to matters that might be canvassed before this Parliament. I agree with the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that it is not unreasonable to believe that, because of the context in which these resolutions were put, the Commission could well have been doing no more than taking the prudent action that any organisation would take to ensure that public statements that were made, and certainly something as serious as a submission to a parliamentary committee on behalf of the Commission itself, received the prior approval of the Commission. The difficulty is, of course, that the resolution does not say that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I said at one point during our discussions that that was possibly because they did not have the services of the Parliamentary Counsel, although I have seen some errors in my time made by that erudite group of people. I do not think the fact can be escaped that, prima facie, there is enough concern to warrant a recommendation from the Committee to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. I say again that a common sense and reasonable interpretation of the resolution of the ADC could well come to the conclusion that if there has been a breach of privilege it may well have been simply that the new Commission, having only recently been appointed, was not very familiar with the standing orders relating to privileges of the Parliament. </PARA>

I have no hesitation in saying that, in terms of consistency with the decision we took with Mrs McPherson, and again in the context in which the circumstances occurred, I have no difficulty in supporting the unanimous view of the members of the Committee that there is sufficient concern about these matters to warrant its proper investigation in the proper place, and that is by the Privileges Committee of this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have not been able to scan it or to read the various letters which make up the bulk of the document which has been tabled today. I welcome the fact that the Committee has found in the way it has and, given that I have raised the matter with the President, I now look forward to hearing from the President, presumably tomorrow, in response to the letter that I wrote requesting referral of these matters to the Committee of Privileges.

The Committee will have a heavy obligation simply to look at the facts on relevant dates-it will have difficulty of all others in doing that-and will have to rely on evidence adduced. I have little doubt that what will now follow is a reference from this place to the Committee of Privileges. Any further consideration of this report prior to that probably will be unnecessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to this debate because I regard it as very important indeed. Having been around this place for many years, I am conscious of the importance which senators and others-by `others' I mean the general public most importantly-attach to their right to make submissions, then to give evidence to parliamentary committees, and to do so without fear or favour, without fear of being discriminated against in any way. After all, we are today talking about our right to exercise our representative function through the committee system. It is not possible for each and every one of us to go into the detail of each and every piece of legislation or matter that comes before this Parliament. That is why frequently we refer matters to committees. A number of members who are elected by this chamber can constitute a committee, can examine the subject matter, call for submissions, receive them, interview witnesses and then finally make a report to this Parliament, on which there is subsequent debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have served on many such committees. They are time-consuming, but nevertheless rewarding. Such committees are informative to ourselves as members of committees, to our colleagues in the Senate, and indeed to the Parliament and the public. Therefore, we are talking about an important function of an elected member of parliament, namely the representative function. That function enables us to represent the interests of persons, the electors. Many people will look carefully at what the Privileges Committee does in the matter that we hope will be referred to it. It is important for the general public, and more importantly for public servants, to be readily assured that they can give full information to committees of this Parliament without fear of any direct or indirect penalty. Therefore, I support the unanimous recommendation made by the Committee to refer these two questions to the Privileges Committee. I shall look forward to hearing the Committee's views on this important matter. </PARA>

I hope and believe that when the members of the Senate Committee of Privileges come to look at the case that is being referred to it, they will have very much in mind that they will not simply in their deliberations be determining whether a breach of privilege has occurred in the case of these two individuals whose case will be examined. The members of the Committee will not be examining that matter from any party political point of view because, as everyone in this place is well aware, the position of the Australian Labor Party on the one hand and that of the present coalition parties on the other hand varies in this chamber with the passing years. Sometimes we are on one side of this chamber and sometimes we are on the other. The determinations of the Privileges Committee, with major implications for the future functioning of this place, will have as much significance for the future operations of the Parliament viewed from the standpoint of one party as from the standpoint of other parties in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadow that I will move some amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1988. Prior to doing so I want to raise an issue which has been raised with me by a number of people and I suspect that it has also been raised with other senators-that is, the question of the 20 per cent sales tax on hand tools and outdoor portable petrol-driven tools. There is concern among members of the small business community that, with what they claim is the significant devaluation of the Australian dollar over the last two years, they are suffering considerable economic hardship as a result of the price increases of imported hand and power tools, and that this additional 20 per cent sales tax, on top of the higher prices, is a further burden for them because consumers are simply not in a position to pay this additional cost. I know that the attitude of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is that we should curb consumer spending, that we should get our balance of payments in a little better shape than it currently is, and that one way to do so is to discourage people from buying imported goods. That will not be terribly useful if we put people out of work and/or out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A letter that has been sent to me by a number of people who are involved in selling these goods claims that unless they are able to obtain some assistance in the form of lessening or eliminating the sales tax they fear quite genuinely that a continuing downturn in consumer demand for the product will occur. This means they will have to lay off staff and also consider winding up their businesses. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) whether he considers that the revenue that will be raised from this sales tax is justified in the event of loss of jobs occurring, in the event of businesses winding down. I also ask whether this is part of the Treasurer's program of discouraging the purchase of imported goods. I understand in any event that these goods were taxed by the previous Liberal Government, so it is not a new tax; it is simply an increase. Is this increase part of the Treasurer's plan to balance our trade problems by discouraging people from buying these sorts of imported goods?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move the following amendments in respect of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Page 4, the Schedule, Part I, proposed amendment of sub-item 119a (1), leave out the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Page 5, the Schedule, Part II, proposed new item 4aa, leave out the proposed new item. </PARA>
<PARA>I indicated during my speech on the second reading that the Australian Democrats would move some amendments to this legislation. My colleague Senator Macklin intends to move an amendment with regard to removing sales tax from certain items that, after adaptation, can be used by people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> One of my amendments relates to subitem 119a (1)-that is, that part of the legislation which removes the sales tax on private jets. I raised this matter during my speech on the second reading. I said I thought it was somewhat anomalous-despite the fact that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) claimed in his second reading speech that this legislation would remove anomalies-to place sales tax on all sorts of items that many families regard as essentials and not luxuries, while at the same time removing it from a commodity which most of us do not have the good or bad fortune to own, cannot afford to own and probably would not use if we did own them. Nevertheless, it is rather strange that significant levels of sales tax are being imposed on foodstuffs and children's drinks, yet we are removing it from private jets. My first amendment which has been circulated would leave out that proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> During my speech on the second reading I also raised what could be regarded as another anomaly whereby a sales tax is to be applied to bathroom fittings. I asked only half frivolously during my second reading contribution whether the Minister could say in just what circumstances that sales tax applies. For example, if ordinary families put bathroom fittings into their homes, as most do in Australia, one presumes that the sales tax would apply. If somebody puts similar bathroom fittings, goldplated or otherwise, into an executive jet, or a private jet which is now exempt from sales tax, are those bathroom fittings also exempt from sales tax?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe it is correct that executive jets will be exempt, although there may be an exemption for some light aircraft. I think the answer-I can check it later-is that no, those fittings would not be subject to sales tax because such expenditure would be regarded as part of business as distinct from household expenditure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not actually expect that the Government would enthusiastically, or even grudgingly, support these amendments but I do hope that the Opposition, even if it does not support the first amendment, will consider seriously my second amendment which relates to flavoured soy milk. While that does not sound like a terribly exciting item, an increasing number of children in this country cannot tolerate ordinary cow's milk and their parents are forced to put them onto soy milk. I know it has been a long time since many people in this chamber have had to deal with very small children, but getting them to consume plain soy milk is not an easy task. It does seem rather unfortunate that when one has a child with the sort of disability, allergy or whatever that requires the child to take soy milk as a substitute for ordinary milk, the one item that makes it palatable-namely the flavouring-is the item that increases the cost because of the sale tax that now applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept that the Government has introduced this provision in a spirit of removing anomalies, because flavoured milk also attracts a higher sales tax. While I am not exactly thrilled about that, I think we can probably tolerate it. But what is a serious problem is anything that increases the cost to a family in which there may be one or more children who have a problem with physically tolerating-not just disliking, as they might not like to eat broccoli-milk so that in order to give the children the proper balance in their diet their parents turn to soy milk. If the only way they can get their children to drink it is in flavoured form, it is very unfortunate indeed if we make it more expensive by applying a tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I will raise some other evidence. We are talking about two separate commodities here-milk which may or may not be flavoured, and soy milk which may or may not be flavoured. I can quite understand that administratively it is probably simpler for the administrators of these things if both plain milk and flavoured milk are dealt with in a similar fashion, but the problem we have here is not whether plain milk and plain soy milk should be exempt from sales tax for administrative purposes and whether flavoured milk and flavoured soy milk should be dealt with in a similar fashion through the sales tax system because it suits the administrators that that should happen; all we are talking about here is an additional detrimental factor for some fairly ordinary Australian families who are already facing a problem with their child's diet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to say this is a humanitarian matter; it is a simple case of understanding what it is like to have a child in one's family whose diet has to be watched constantly. I happen to have one. We do not have to feed her soy milk but we have had to do all sorts of other things. It is a constant challenge when families have one or more children whose diet has to be restricted in some way. One is constantly looking for substitutes to give them an interesting diet, a healthy diet and one which will not cause them additional problems. Children are children. One can argue that they should drink plain soy milk and be grateful they are not going to be sick as a consequence, but childhood does not last all that long and I would have thought it was not asking a great deal simply to let them have some flavouring in the blasted stuff so that they can consume it with some enthusiasm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a valid point. Senator Messner has raised a matter which a number of us should take to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). At the moment soya milk, whether it is flavoured or not, is taxed at the rate of 20 per cent. This Bill reduces that to nil for plain soya milk. In the case of flavoured milk it reduces the tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. I think the argument that has been advanced by Senator Haines is valid. I do not know how the Government and the Opposition take these things on the run, but it seems to me to be a fairly minor matter economically and fiscally but a very major matter for many of the people involved, small in number thought they may be.

<PARA>``After item 123, the following item is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA> `123aa. (1) Goods, not covered by any other item in this Schedule, for use as special aids, and not for sale for that purpose, by persons who are disabled or physically or mentally handicapped, in respect of whom a medical practitioner or a qualified or registered occupational therapist has certified that the use of the goods as special aids is necessary, in such cases or circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as are prescribed. </PARA>

<PARA> `(2) Parts for goods covered by sub-item (1)</PARA>
<PARA>Nos. 1</PARA>
<PARA>to 9' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>The argument that I wish to present here is one which, as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has been advised, I have presented before but which I intend to present until I get some satisfactory response from the Government. The circumstances I am talking about are ones which tend to arise more and more. The reason for this is that up to now those goods which are sales tax exempt and are being used by disabled people are essentially chosen by the Department, but they are also goods which have been specifically manufactured for disabled people. I am not talking about that category of items; I am talking about a totally different category of items. I ask honourable senator to think about the research and development costs which are necessary in the development of a specific item for disabled people. Those costs are large, and because the number of sales is relatively small the item itself is very costly. It makes eminent sense-and every government has done it-to remove sales tax there. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is another series of items which are not manufactured for disabled people but are manufactured for all-for example, computers. There is no way in the world that a research and development program will be undertaken by any company in relation to specific computers for disabled people. Some of the major companies such as IBM Ltd, Apple Computer Pty Ltd and others have undertaken specific research and development projects on peripherals for disabled people in the use of computers. However, the essential computer item which is necessary still has sales tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline some of the situations in which people might find themselves. The example that first kindled my interest in this matter was that of a child who was born with thalidomide problems, with his hands attached to his shoulders. His hands were operational. That child-and thank goodness this is now the case in our society-attends a normal school, not a special school. But obviously he has enormous difficulty in doing the other things that kids in the class do, such as painting, drawing and writing. A number of people from universities and various associations concerned with disabled people, banded together and actually came up with a method of dividing a standard keyboard into two and mounting it on special brackets so that that child was able to use the machine. The child used that machine for a few months prior to school and then wished to take it to school. That was also accomplished and that child is now doing well in school. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, the commercial operators who sold that computer to the parents took no profit because they discovered that they could not sell it to that disabled child without sales tax being imposed. The reason I mention the way the commercial operators reacted is that they had that gut feeling that it was really a pretty low exercise to impose the tax and they were willing to forgo their own profits so that the family could get that device for the child. Retailers are in the business of making profits and I do not want to knock them for that. I think it is interesting to note that they were willing to forgo that profit because of a gut feeling about this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department on previous occasions has come up with a number of reasons why this might not be able to be done. The chief one amongst those is that the Department believes that it is a better judge of what is useful for disabled people than those people are themselves. I totally reject that and, interestingly, the Government itself has rejected it. As a result of legislation passed in this place, I think three years ago, under the then Minister for Community Services Grimes, a new philosophy on disabled people was put in place. That was not the previous patronising philosophy but a philosophy whereby, at the direction of disabled people, we would try to make sure that they could live their lives as independently and productively as possible in the way that they wished to live them, not the way that some Department wished them to live them. </PARA>
<PARA> So, my amendment involves a philosophical approach. The approach is in keeping with the new Act, which is now operational and which will have completed its implementation phase by the end of next year. My amendment is completely in keeping with the philosophy the Government espoused through the Department. I believe that the Australian Taxation Office ought to espouse the same philosophy. It is the Tax Office which decides which items are useful to disabled people and which are not-not the Department of Community Services and Health, or anybody else. It is the officers in the Tax Office who make the decisions as to disabled people, rather than following the new philosophy which the Government has implemented-and quite rightly implemented-and which the Democrats wholeheartedly support, whereby the disabled themselves take control over their own lives and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain computer software-almost totally commercially available, not specially written software-is widely used now in many of the organisations which work with the learning disabled. It is used in many schools by students with learning disabilities, and in special schools. Some types of software are used for cause and effect activities, for example, with severely intellectually disabled students. Many new adventure packages are coming onto the market which enable people to move individually through learning courses. I suggest that honourable senators, if they have the opportunity, visit some of the places that are using computers with the learning disabled. They will see the remarkable progress those people are able to make by being able to work individually with the computers. At the end of the exercise they often produce a high quality document-quite unlike anything else they have been able to produce before. It is an enormous boost to their morale. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sensory disabled, computer speech in association with pictures on screens is now available, as are braille-to-print or print-to-braille conversion mechanisms. Many of these items are not specifically devised for blind people. Most of the hardware and software in a braille-to-print or print-to-braille conversion mechanism is commercially available. Only a very small part of the software component is specifically written for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already raised one matter with regard to the physically disabled. A major point is that most of the peripherals and technologies which are being used seek, in whatever way they can, to fool the computer into thinking that it is being controlled by some other mechanism, such as a keyboard, a joy- stick, a mouse or whatever else. Computers are being operated by voice commands or by the movement of the head, the eyes or some other part of the physically disabled person's body. A great deal of work is being done in this area. I have raised this matter before. Last year the Opposition said that it wanted some time to consider the proposal. It has had a year in which to do so. I circulated my amendment to the Opposition about three weeks ago so that it would have forewarning that the matter was being raised again. It is a matter which we have to come to grips with. It is no good any longer simply to say, `We will let the Department make up its mind as to what it will do in these areas'. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the debate on this issue last year I have discussed it exhaustively with various community groups that work with disabled people. I have the unanimous support of those groups. They are all very much aware that, with the development of technology, we will see coming onto the general public market more and more items which may be used to enormous advantage by disabled people. It will not involve just computers. There will be many other technological developments. We are in a new phase. We are not talking about a small company somewhere developing specific goods for a specific clientele. We are talking about enormous amounts of money being spent on developing high tech products that will be of enormous benefit to disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am asking is that, in a Budget in which this Government has been willing to lose $400m on what I have characterised as the promotion of alcoholism, we could very well consider my proposal, a proposal which would have very small and very controlled cost consequences. It would involve only those items whose use as special aids a medical practitioner or qualified or registered occupational therapist has certified as necessary. In other words, it would leave the way open for medical practitioners to be able to say in respect of one of their patients, `This person would benefit enormously from having access to and use of these goods and the family is able to purchase them'. Under those circumstances I do not believe that we should be seeking to make a profit out of the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I cite the instance that got me involved in this area in the first place. It was interesting to note that in that case the commercial operators also did not want to make a profit out of selling the goods. They believed that that was not the type of thing that ought to be done. I appeal to honourable senators yet again to give serious consideration to this proposal. It is a very moderate proposal and well in keeping with the Government's own philosophy on the delivery of services to disabled people. My amendment has been couched in a form which complies with all the other provisions in part 1 of the schedule concerned with the delivery of goods to disabled people and the removal of sales tax from those goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition could not be unmoved by the case which Senator Macklin has made out on this issue. I recall his raising the matter in relation to the sales tax Bills, if not last year, may be the year before and in other years. It is a matter with which I think all honourable senators would feel some empathy. The problem is that we are flying blind on this matter. We have no information as to the cost of such a proposal; nor do we know exactly how it would be administered and in what way it could be controlled. I am sure that even Senator Macklin would agree that opportunities could be opened up for undermining the sales tax law and that the proposal in operation would have to be strictly governed. The Opposition is not prepared to support the amendment on this occasion. But I believe that, as this is a matter of some concern, given that it has been raised in the Senate over a long period, the Government ought to produce for us a detailed examination of it so that we can, perhaps, consider in the Parliament a future proposal which may very well meet Senator Macklin's requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all of us would be most concerned if, with the developing technology affecting disabled people, proper consideration were not given to their special circumstances. We should do all in our power to assist their becoming whole people, or as near whole as possible, by the provision of technology so that they can use their talents fully. Of course, the costs of this needs to be taken into account. But I believe that the Government should take note of Senator Macklin's points and the Opposition's concern about this matter. It should try on a future occasion to come forward with a proposition which we can properly debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Government is already aware of the rapidly developing technology in this area affecting disabled people, whether they be blind, people with hearing problems, or those afflicted with problems of the limbs. Certainly all those people would benefit tremendously from a government initiative in this area. It may well be that assistance for people in this area could stem from some form of benefit other than the taxation exemptions of the kind Senator Macklin envisages. Nevertheless, the Opposition believes that there is a case that could be examined and we look forward to future action by the Government in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us assume that the case put has the merit that Senator Macklin claims it has-and I stress the words `let us assume that'. His proposal would reduce by 10 per cent or 20 per cent-or actually slightly less than that-of the sales tax inclusive price the cost of a certain number of aids. I am informed that it is more likely 20 per cent but sometimes it is 10 per cent. Of course, that does not address the question of where the other 80 or 90 per cent or 81 or 91 per cent comes from. If the case is as compelling as Senator Messner claims, I would have thought that it would have been more properly addressed with some sort of means tested or income tested subsidy, or whatever, rather than providing an exemption from sales tax which, by its very nature, is likely to be skewed in favour of the people who can provide the 81 per cent or 91 per cent and to whom the sales tax cost is a marginal item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there are a number of other problems with the proposition. As has already been acknowledged, there are a number of items of specialised equipment which are free from sales tax and which are explicitly named. The proposal here though, of course, is to exempt from sales tax certain goods that are used by people other than the disabled-goods that are in general use. The proposal is to put some control over it by having a certificate from a medical practitioner, or an occupational therapist, and so on. Obviously that complicates the administration quite significantly and, as Senator Messner suggested, it is not entirely free from the prospect of abuse. Let me make it very clear: this is not a comment about the medical profession in general, but there are doctors who will sign almost anything that is put in front of them in regard to compensation. Of course, doctors, including officials of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), privately acknowledge this, although I understand that they are reluctant to acknowledge it publicly. If there are doctors who are willing to do that, those same doctors would be able to establish a bit of a profitable sideline by also signing these sorts of certificates for anybody who asked them-and this is in addition to the administrative complications. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, unpopular though people who are specialists in tax policy may be, the tax policy questions are better left principally to the Australian Taxation Office or the taxation policy division of the Treasury rather than the AMA. Senator Macklin's proposal would not leave it to the AMA but would leave it to individual medical practitioners, which I suggest would be even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already covered the equity provision. Let me recapitulate briefly. If the case is as compelling as Senator Macklin suggests, this is fiddling around at the margins and it does not address the core issue anyway. In addition, it complicates the administration of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and it is open to abuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister's response appears to be dealing with another area, not with the sales tax legislation or the principles on which that is based. We are dealing with the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Already under this legislation there is the recognised principle that we do not impose a taxation burden on persons who are already disadvantaged in a way different from that of the normal population. We are talking here about persons who, for one reason or other, are physically or mentally handicapped. What the Minister's response is really going to is another area altogether, I agree with him: whether support should be given specifically to persons with handicaps in another way. But here we are talking about the exemptions that ought to apply. Those exemptions already apply in respect of disabled persons. Surely all we are doing is seeking to extend that logically to have regard to modern technology. In those circumstances it is a matter that deserves the support of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a couple of points that the Minister raised are worthwhile taking up. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) alleged that if these amendments were passed, it would simply be tinkering around the margins-I think he used the words `fiddling around the margins'. In fact, this whole Bill tinkers around at the margins. That is the purpose of this exercise. Every time we have a sales tax exemptions and classifications Bill before us it is because we are tinkering at yet another margin. Sooner or later I hope that we run out of margins or out of the capacity to tinker. We keep talking about getting rid of anomalies and we just introduce more of them. We talk about not making life difficult for people who are already in difficulties, and we keep on doing it. Even if we were just tinkering at the margins, surely this margin is worth tinkering at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Essentially the Minister said that if people can afford to pay for a computer, they can afford to pay the sales tax. He said that 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the ultimate purchase price is sales tax, and, presumably, if people can afford the 80 per cent to 90 per cent, they can afford the additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent. That is true of everything. Even if it were not, it is hardly a justifiable argument. Maybe-just maybe-for some parents who are not on the incomes that people in this place are, that 10 per cent or 20 per cent is just too much for them to be able to afford that item. Caring for a child with that sort of disability is an expensive process-in case nobody in this chamber has ever noticed it. I would have thought that if the Government were going to take that line of argument anyway, it would at least be consistent about it. If people can afford a private plane, I am quite sure that they can afford the sales tax that was applying but which, under this legislation, will no longer apply. The Minister says that the sales tax is coming off private planes because it is too complicated to administer. He then tells us that it cannot come off computers and other equipment that have been adapted for people with disabilities because it is too difficult to administer. Please, could we stop watching Jim Hacker operating in Yes, Minister and get around to a little consistency, if not a little compassion. I am rather surprised that after all the years that we have been bringing this up in this place at least the Opposition is not prepared to support this proposal and see some merit in it. It is not too complicated to take the sales tax off. We do it for other items. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposition that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) put a little while ago regarding administrative difficulties quite frankly is false and can be shown to be false, which I will proceed to do now. In the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act there are several items which necessitate the certification of a handicap to be produced before exemption from sales tax on certain goods is allowed. In other words, the procedures-whether the people who happen to be advising the Minister in the chamber at the moment know it or not-happen to be there already. Item 123a, which is the first schedule, provides exemption for interactive and broadcast videotex systems, broadcast teletext decoding devices, and similar decoding devices of a kind used in or in connection with television receivers where the system or device is for use and not for sale by profoundly deaf persons or persons taken to be profoundly deaf. Exemption for this equipment is on a restricted basis and available only to persons to whom a certificate as to the extent of their hearing disability has been furnished. This is a clear case where the mechanisms are already in place within the department. That is why I said that my amendment was couched in terms of something that is already operating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at another item, item 135a of the schedule, which has provisions which requires evidence of a handicap before sales tax exemptions are offered to the persons seeking them. Under this item motor vehicles, and parts thereof, for use in the transportation to and from the gainful employment of a person in respect of whom the Director-General of Social Services, or an officer appointed by him for the purpose, has certified that he has lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he is permanently unable to use public transport are also exempt. In other words, we go through these mechanisms to deal with these particular issues. There is no administrative difficulty. If there were the Government would be taking certain items out of the legislation before us today for the reason it has given in respect of sales tax on aeroplanes, that is, that it is administratively difficult. The Government did not do it. Therefore it is accepting the proposition that these mechanisms are administratively available. My amendment fits into that category. There is nothing different. It is exactly the same mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> Item 42 (17) refers to wigs and hairpieces for people who are clinically bald, provided there is certification that the person has lost his or her hair due to sickness or disease. The items go on and on. It is utter bunkum to suggest that this is administratively difficult because if it were the Government, following its line in terms of taking things out which are administratively difficult, would have sought to remove them long ago. It has not sought to do so. It has left them in there and it knows why it has left them in there. There is a very good case for those particular exemptions to be in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate a point that Senator Haines made about the dry economics that the Minister put forward-that if someone can afford 80 per cent of an item he can afford the 100 per cent. That is not a proposition which can endear itself to anybody--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the opposite of what I said. I said that it does not address the question of those who cannot afford the 80 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly does not address the problem of the 80 per cent. The suggestion now is that the Government is opposing this because it does not help everybody. I admit that it does not help everybody. I have been talking about this for years and the Government has not come forward with any proposition which will help everybody. I am trying to suggest alleviating part of the burden on those people. That is all. All I am suggesting is that we should not be making money out of those people who have a disability. I do not think anybody else in the community wants to take money out of their pockets. I do not think the community wants that tax. The community may have wanted a tax on executive jets which it just lost, but it certainly does not want a tax on equipment used by disabled people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister wants to debate that, I would be quite happy to go out to any group in Australia to see how many people he can get on his side. It stands to reason that people do not want us to put a tax on these items. We want to alleviate the burden somewhat, and that is all we are doing. I am not suggesting that this is the be all and end all, or somehow or other a magic panacea for those people. I have seen what goes on in those circumstances. I have had personal contact with such people. I know that this is only a very small amount of assistance to those people and their families, who suffer every day and who put in almost a 24-hour day. I know that it does not do everything. The Minister does not have to preach to me about that-I know full well. But it might assist people somewhat in acquiring the things that they need or that their children need to give them the best life they can have in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting that this is becoming more and more urgent because we are dealing with matters of a technological kind. More of those devices are coming onto the market. They have been developed and research has been done on them by multinationals. They are developed for a mass market, not for a specific market. I find it odd that provided a company will actually develop specific products at a very high cost-almost every product available to a disabled person is a very high cost product because of the very small group of people who will be using it-we will take the sales tax off but we will not do the same with lower cost products which are mass produced even though they are often incredibly effective. I have seen people suffering from quite severe cerebral palsy doing printing work. Sometimes it takes them hours to set up a page, but once they have set it up and got it out their enormous satisfaction is something that everybody should see. They can present to the world, in a way in which they have never been able to do before, a top class A1 product. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people in Australia are attempting to develop products and employment opportunities for disabled people. We need to give people those opportunities at a much younger age. We need to follow the philosophy that the Government put in its own Act regarding disabled people. We should allow disabled people to make the decisions-not some bureaucrat in the Australian Taxation Office-about which goods will or will not be of use to them. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment is couched in that philosophy. While I may agree with the Minister on a number of items-we often find ourselves on the same side with regard to some of the things he says about medical practitioners-to bring that into this debate is a pretty poor argument. An argument about an industrial matter or one about pay is quite out of place with regard to the relationship between the patient and the medical practitioner or the occupational therapist. It has nothing to do with this particular item at all. The people working with disabled people are the people best qualified to suggest what is in their best interests. Whether at some other stage the Minister wants to debate whether they should be getting the type of remuneration they are getting is a totally different matter. I do not think that disabled people should be dragged into a brawl that the Minister may be having with the Australian Medical Association. Although at the end of the day I could very well end up agreeing with the Minister's attitude to the AMA, I do not agree that it has anything to do with this particular proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I would urge honourable senators to look again at this. If they are unable to support it now could I at least ask that somebody look at this in more detail than has obviously happened to date. I cannot get anything out of the Department or anybody else. Yet on the other side in terms of the various groups who are working with disabled people they see this as the way ahead. They see this as a mechanism whereby they can get into a lot of the items that come on to the market. It may very well be-and I am indebted to Senator Hamer for making a suggestion on this and I hope he does not mind my saying that it was his suggestion-that it is possibly the kind of item that could be looked at by a Senate committee. I happen to think that if we are getting nowhere down this track perhaps we should do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps in these particular Acts we should not only look at this item but also look at all other items with regard to disabled people. The Acts must be riddled through with inconsistencies and they are certainly in no way commensurate with or in any way reflective of the philosophy that the Government has put in its own Act. I am merely I suppose expressing my exasperation with this particular exercise. It takes so long to address what I think is a relatively simple issue. I will accept the proposition that Senator Haines accepted. It might be tinkering at the edges. I am quite happy to tinker at the edges if that is all we are allowed to do because that tinkering to some of those families is mightily important, I can assure honourable senators. They have put it to me time and time again that it is important to them in their lifestyle and in the type of support that they are able to provide to their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I want to pick up on a comment that was made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), this time by way of interjection, on something that Senator Macklin said. Apparently the partially motivating force behind the Government's refusal to accept this and to see reason is that not everyone will benefit so the Government does not let anybody benefit. The Government believes that not everybody can afford to pay the 80 per cent and, therefore, it will not let those who can afford to pay the 80 per cent benefit from the fact that they do not have to pay the additional 20 per cent. If we are talking about fairness and equity and arguing that 100 per cent of people have to benefit from something or we do not do it, that if we offer a concession or a benefit or exemption or whatever and argue that unless 100 per cent of the people in the group can get some measure of assistance out of it we do not do it, then we will have to scrap most of the legislation that we deal with in this place. Why do we have group specific tax deductions, for example? Why do we have tax concessions that help some people even though they do not help everybody? Why do we allow tax concessions for rates, for example, when not everyone pays them? I have not heard the Minister argue that we should not offer certain tax concessions to companies which would allow some of them to get their tax payable down to zero cents in the dollar just because not everybody can get their tax payable down to zero cents in the dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To argue that we cannot pass an amendment like this that will benefit people who are already behind a variety of eight balls, including an economic one, because not everyone will be able to take advantage of it is probably the weakest of the arguments that I have heard put before us. Any government operates on a system where items are means tested, where concessions are offered, where deductions are provided, where there may be benefits to some and not to others, where need is taken into account and, indeed, in far too many areas in the tax system where need does not even rate a mention. The more one has the better off one is quite frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> To argue that we cannot do this because not everyone will benefit, because not everybody will come up with the 80 per cent, is simply not on. I accept Senator Macklin's generous words about Senator Hamer for suggesting that maybe we refer this to a committee. But I for one, and I suspect families with children who have disabilities and indeed adults who have disabilities, are getting a bit tired of being committee reference material. We do not send off to committees the question of whether we can have negative gearing on foreign financed takeovers continued even though we know that is pushing up the foreign debt, even though we know it is depleting Consolidated Revenue because some companies can take advantage of it and some cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> Sending this matter to a committee means delaying a decision. There may be a decision and a useful decision at the end of it. But I ask the committee how many families and how many children will lose out while we sit around in this place and tinker around the margins in a committee debate? How many youngsters will miss out on the educational advantage of the sorts of items that Senator Macklin was talking about? How many families are going to watch their children not develop their potential because they cannot reach a keyboard? What is wrong with this place that we cheerfully accept the fact that Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd pays no tax on its $354m record profit because of the tax concessions that are available to it and yet we cavil at passing an amendment that is in keeping with the Government's own guidelines in this area and that provides a token amount-10 or 20 per cent-of offset to items that may mean the difference between a child developing sufficiently to operate as a complete, well-educated human being who may even get a job and become a taxpayer, and that child not doing that at all?</PARA>

I should make it quite clear to Senator Haines that my purpose was not to delay any action in this area. My purpose was to try to achieve action in this area. I think it is a somewhat more complex problem than Senator Haines has recognised. I notice the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Community Affairs already has a reference given to it two months ago on the subject of the employment of disabled persons. This might well be extended to deal with this sort of area, that is, how we can assist disabled people with assistance and equipment which will enable them to live as normal a life as possible. It is a complex area. Senator Walsh annoyed and antagonised Senator Haines by saying it. It is a question not merely of reducing sales tax. There may be other needs. This is probably an area where a Senate committee could perform very valuable work and would, as a result of its recommendations, command support of the whole Senate. I put it to the Australian Democrats in that light; not as a means of delaying but as a means of achieving something.</PARA></TALK.START>

That applies to various public servants across the board. The debate that has taken place in the committee stage has been useful and I am very hopeful that there is common ground now for ensuring that handicapped persons are able to live their lives in the completest fashion possible-very often that is far more complete than we are able to achieve in this Parliament-and that, as an assistance in that objective, we do not burden those persons with the taxes that we now burden them with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of clause 7 of the Bill, which is the clause under discussion, is to provide a means by which the global borrowing limit that was agreed at the Premiers Conference by all States except Queensland can be enforced. Those limits are set out in subclause 7 (2), together with the limit proposed by the Commonwealth for Queensland. Borrowings are defined as having the same meaning as in the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Act, which answers one of the specific queries Senator Watson had this morning. This Act defines borrowings in the same way as the global approach resolution of Loan Council to include both conventional borrowings and other means of raising money, such as leases and deferred payment schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I expect that Senator Watson and others probably will recall that some years ago a number of States were devising means by which they could effectively get around the global limits that had been agreed, or the predecessors to the global limits. The term `borrowings' in that Act relates to borrowings otherwise than from the Commonwealth. Hence, as I have stated before, it does not cover the general purpose capital payments to the States which are provided as an outlay in the Commonwealth Budget in the form of loans to the States that are repayable. The borrowings covered by the Bill include any borrowings by a State, its semi-government and local authorities, government-owned companies and trusts. This includes borrowings by or on behalf of State financial institutions. However, the Commonwealth's legal advice is that in forming an opinion as to whether a State has exceeded its global borrowing limit the Treasurer would be bound to act in a way consistent with the arrangements agreed with the States and, in particular, the global approach resolution, which would clearly exclude any borrowings from the Commonwealth or by State financial institutions. The Government has assured the States in writing that the clause would be interpreted in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> A broad definition of the bodies whose borrowings were subject to the clause was included because there is no straightforward difference in legal structure between the financial institutions and other State authorities; because the global approach relies on informal agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, based on the definitions used for statistical purposes as to what constitutes a financial institution; and finally because some authorities combine the functions of financial institutions with other functions in the same legal structure. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in summary, the clause is worded as it is essentially for technical reasons, but for those who fear that the intention of the clause may be exceeded because of the way it is worded, that fear is addressed by the guarantee given in writing by the Commonwealth to the States that that will not be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume from the Minister's answer that he does not propose to make changes to the legislation but proposes to issue a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the States as to how he intends to interpret inadequate and inefficient legislation. I put it to the Minister that there is no place for a Treasurer to issue a statement of intent as to how he is going to interpret legislation which is clearly deficient and defective and when amendments to the Act are required. I put it to the Minister: if after hearing my reasoned proposition to him that there is scope for tightening up the provisions of the Bill, which must include a clarification-simple words, simple amendments-perhaps we might have to report progress until next Monday to enable the Committee to remedy defective legislation and to improve something that is essentially a highly contentious area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there has been a problem. Unanimous agreement for the global resolution was not achieved because Queensland walked out as a result of the high-handed treatment it received from the Treasurer at the May Premiers Conference. If it be a lesson to anybody, surely it should be a lesson to the Treasurer that the States must be taken note of and their concerns acknowledged in some way, and that one should not ride roughshod over the Premiers. To get agreement, I understand-and I stand to be corrected-that unanimous agreement is required. In the circumstances Treasurer Keating was unable to get unanimous agreement as the Queensland representatives walked out because of the way they had been treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill does not relate to borrowings otherwise than from the Commonwealth. Those words specifically need to be included to tighten up this area. After all, we are dealing with often contentious negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States. Misunderstandings occur and there has been a failure, as I pointed out in my speech of the second reading, by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to honour previous commitments and undertakings. It is inadequate to adopt a procedure requiring the Treasurer to issue guidelines as to how he will interpret legislation. The function of the Senate is to ensure that we get the legislation right rather than relying on a letter from the Treasurer as to how he will interpret the words `global resolution'. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that there is scope in three areas to tighten this legislation. We will be satisfied if the Minister undertakes to come back with a tighter resolution. Otherwise I am afraid that we shall have to report progress to give the Minister until next Monday to get the legislation right by including some simple words to put the matter beyond reasonable doubt. The Minister acknowledges that there is doubt since he has said that there will be an undertaking by the Treasurer, or indeed he may have already given it in a letter to the States. We acknowledge a need to pay general revenue grants. I think they are paid weekly or fairly regularly. We do not intend to hold up these payments, which are very necessary to the States, but we are giving the Minister a reasonable time to put his house in order. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be said that this is annual legislation and it is unlikely that there will be difficulty or infringement enabling the States or instrumentalities to exceed the global limits. In that case the matter will not come up before next year and there will be new legislation on the books. But perhaps the Minister's successor next year will say, `We will rely on this legislation as it was good enough last year' and it may not be corrected next year. Certainly the present position is not good enough. The Minister has the facility to bring forward appropriate amendments in a statute law revision Bill, but certainly a global resolution requires unanimous agreement, as the Minister must acknowledge. There was confusion last night when the Minister said that the definition of `State instrumentality' according to the Attorney-General's Department did not include State banks and State institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we were advised by the Treasury that it did. I ask for clarification as to how the conflict between the two is to be resolved. I am advised that the legal argument referred not to the definition, as the Minister implied last night in respect of State instrumentalities, but to how the Treasurer's discretionary powers could be interpreted. I think that the Senate is entitled to know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further point arises on this Bill. If we accept the Treasury's advice in terms of the definition of State instrumentality as to whether it includes State banks, if it does so-and I believe it does and the Treasury advice says it does, although the Minister says that the Attorney-General's opinion says it does not-and if we are to proceed on that basis, surely it will subvert the intention of the Loan Council. That is unsatisfactory and only legal change of the definition will overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's definition of `new borrowings' creates a problem as it remains unclear how the loan component of the general purpose capital assistance has been precluded from being classified as a new borrowing. A simple amendment is required to include the words `otherwise than from the Commonwealth'. It is technical but it is necessary. If the Minister is trying to push through sloppy legislation, it is up to the Opposition, including the Australian Democrats, to make sure the Minister gets it right, that he dots the i's and crosses the t's. After all, we are still in a federation. We are dealing with States, with regular payments and revenue grants from the Commonwealth to the States. It is a contentious area and must be got right. Is the Minister prepared to change the legislation, or does he intend to push it through and rely on a discretionary letter of intent as to how the Treasury will apply defective and inadequate definitions for the purpose of reimbursing the States? How does the Minister intend to proceed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the point on which my colleague Senator Watson concluded, I trust that there is no intention by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) or the Government to push this legislation through this evening in its current unsatisfactory state. There would be no excuse or basis for any such action other than the discomfort which the Government is currently feeling as a result of the fact that it has placed before the Parliament, and pushed through the House of Representatives, legislation which, on examination in this place, proves to be technically defective. It would be a gross abuse of what the Government no doubt would call the application of numbers if it were simply to use its numbers-and I presume that it would hope to obtain the numbers of the Australian Democrats-to achieve that purpose. I do not accuse the Government of that intention, but in view of Senator Watson's concluding remarks I thought I should begin by addressing myself to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of another comment made by Senator Watson, I would point out that in case the Government is thinking of arguing that it is necessary to get this legislation through because it is necessary to make these arrangements as soon as possible and not hold up the payment of these general revenue grants to States, then as the Minister is well aware, there is full power under the legislation in the preceding Act of 1985 to continue to make advance payments for the succeeding year, that is to say, the year we are now in. That is as I understand the position, and if I am wrong no doubt the Minister will correct me. There is certainly a comparable provision in the legislation for this year in respect of 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the clause of the Bill which is causing the problem. It is a clause to which I referred at some length in my speech yesterday evening in the second reading debate when, as Senator Watson said, the Minister gave some responses both to Senator Watson's remarks and to mine-responses which he now concedes were based on a misunderstanding of what we had been referring to. I accept that the Minister's responses were given in good faith at the time and I make no further criticism in that regard other than to say that the record will now show that the responses given at the time were in error. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct the attention of honourable senators to the extraordinary situation that now exists. Last May the Commonwealth met in Loan Council with the Premiers and Treasurers of all six States and the Northern Territory. A resolution was reached with five of those States to govern the so-called global borrowing limits for 1988-89. The Queensland Government did not agree with that resolution and has continued to differ with the Commonwealth on it. As a consequence, this punitive clause of the Bill, clause 7, seeks to give power to the Treasurer to impose a penalty upon any State which, in the opinion of the Treasurer, at the unfettered discretion of the Treasurer, exceeds the global borrowing limit imposed upon that State-and, indeed, all States-by the Commonwealth last May. Be that as it may, the imposition at that time of those global borrowing limits was in the framework of a resolution of the Loan Council-I have forgotten what the precise title of the resolution was-governing the global borrowing limits of the States. In terms of that resolution there are certain definitions as to what is and what is not covered by those global borrowing limits; in other words, by the term `borrowings' for that purpose. Yet the Bill contains a different definition. That is the nub of the Government's problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has been good enough during the day-and I acknowledge his courtesy-to circulate to me, Senator Watson, and possibly other senators, some points which he read into the record this evening which seek to bridge this gap between the two quite diverse definitions-on the one hand, the global borrowing limits resolution of the Loan Council and, on the other, the definition of what constitutes borrowings in clause 7 (1) (a) of the Bill. I will not go over the ground again because it has been covered by both Senator Watson and me, last night and again, to some degree, a little earlier by Senator Watson. Let me raise a few points for consideration by the Minister and honourable senators as to the effects of passing this legislation in its current form. I imagine that the Minister will urge that we do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider first the example that I touched on briefly last night: a borrowing by the State Bank of Victoria. There is no doubt that such a borrowing constitutes a borrowing by an instrumentality of the Government of Victoria and is therefore covered by the definition in clause 7 (1) (a) of the Bill. Such a borrowing, however, would not be a borrowing for the purposes of the Loan Council resolution governing the global limits. It is not included within that coverage for the purpose of that resolution. What we have been told today by the Minister-it was read into the record a moment ago-is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has made it plain in correspondence with the State governments that, notwithstanding what might be contained in the Bill, borrowings of that kind would not be counted as borrowings for the purposes of penalty clause 7 (1) (b). </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it that, in itself, is a sufficiently strange situation to warrant considerable comment, but that is not the entire point that I want to make. In that case the State of Victoria, by having one of its instrumentalities make such a borrowing, would actually exceed the borrowings shown in the table in clause 7 (2) beside the name `Victoria', but it would not be subject to a penalty for doing so. It would endure no penalty, even though, clearly, it would be in breach of the provisions of clause 7 (1). </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the other example, involving the Government of Queensland. I remind the Committee that this whole apparatus is directed towards that Government. Queensland does not have a State bank, so let us assume that one of its financial intermediaries, Suncorp-which, for the benefit of non-Queensland senators, is the equivalent of the State Government Insurance Corporation in most other States-borrows in the financial markets and uses the proceeds to buy a parcel of mortgages from the State Government Housing Commission. The State Government Housing Commission is perfectly entitled to sell its assets. That does not constitute a borrowing on the part of the State Government Housing Commission, although it does involve a borrowing by Suncorp. With the proceeds of that sale of assets the Housing Commission can then proceed to build some more houses, thereby undertaking the kind of economic activity which I presume the Government has set out to stop it undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be open to the Treasurer, in terms of this Bill, to say that Suncorp, as a Government instrumentality of the State of Queensland, has made a borrowing-there would not be any doubt that that was so-and that because it had made a borrowing he proposed to implement the punitive measures open to him and entirely at his unfettered discretion under clause 7 (1) (b) of the Bill. Of course, if he were to do so, he would be operating totally differently from the manner in which he operated, by turning a blind eye, in the case of the Victorian example. Both of these hypothetical borrowings-on the one hand by the State Bank of Victoria and on the other by the Suncorp instrumentality of Queensland-constitute borrowings by financial intermediaries. There is no difference between them in that sense. The only difference so far as I can see is that one is made by a government which the Treasurer does not want to punish and the other is made by a government which he does want to punish, for purely political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The point on which I focus, leaving aside the political question, is that this would involve totally discriminatory treatment between the two States-treatment that is entirely out of accord with the text of the legislation. This piece of legislation is supposed to apply-indeed, for good constitutional reasons, it must apply-without any discriminatory basis between the States. It must apply equally between the States. Yet the only way in which the Treasurer in those circumstances can make his writ run, to impose the penalty which he is hell-bent on imposing on Queensland-otherwise we would not have clause 7 in the Bill; that is the only reason that it appears-is to discriminate between the two States in his treatment of a borrowing by two financial intermediaries in the two cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a situation would be quite extraordinary. It would take the actions initiated at the May meeting of the Loan Council to a further depth of iniquity on the part of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I trust that that will not be the case. This situation is intolerable. The piece of legislation has been drafted in such a way that it states one thing, but we are told by the Minister that the Treasurer has already given certain assurances to the States by letter that it will not be interpreted in terms of the plain meaning of the language of the law. </PARA>

I make one further point before we hear what the Minister has to say in response to these remarks. I have already expressed my thanks to the Minister for his courtesy in providing a couple of senators on this side of the chamber with some explanatory notes as to where the problem lies. We actually knew where the problem lay before we received the explanatory notes. I would have to say, without wishing to make a derogatory remark, that to some degree the notes seem to have been provided more for the information of the Minister than for our information. But be that as it may, I would also have expected the Minister at the very least to have produced and laid on the table in this chamber a copy of the letter which the Treasurer is said to have written to each of the State governments saying what he will do and what he will not do and how he will in fact interpret the legislation as enacted, if it is enacted, by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that I think this situation is reaching the Gilbertian stage. We are being pressed to pass a piece of legislation which the Minister, in his capacity of representing the Treasurer, and the Treasurer have already told the States is unworkable in the terms in which the Parliament is being asked to pass it. There may have been other examples, but I certainly do not recall, at least in the financial field, a piece of legislation structured like this and to be implemented in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are ways around that, of course, as Senator Messner knows. Senator Watson said that this is a technically defective Bill and the Government has to fix it up. Senator Stone has now spelt out his real objection. Clause 7 provides the mechanism to enforce the agreement reached at the Premiers Conference by the Commonwealth and every State other than Queensland. That includes the new Liberal Government of New South Wales and the Liberal Government of Tasmania. It was agreed to by every State except Queensland. So Senator Stone's real objection to clause 7 is that it provides that mechanism to ensure that that unanimous bar one Loan Council agreement is actually implemented. Of course the States can borrow what they like but clause 7 provides that if they exceed that unanimous bar one Loan Council agreement they will have their payments from the Commonwealth reduced accordingly. As I said, Senator Stone had already shown what was in the mind of the Queensland Government before he had a chance to curb his tongue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the allegations of technical defectiveness, I have already said that some authorities combine the functions of financial institutions with other functions in the same legal structure.

Frankly, I am a bit sick of having to stay in here. The Government has been threatened-I can only interpret Senator Watson's comments as a threat-with the Opposition moving to report progress. That is fine by me. Frankly I would be relieved to get away from here. I think I can confidently make on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), firstly in regard to the specific point Senator Watson raised, the offer that that will be examined by the Attorney-General's Department, and I think I can also confidently offer Treasury officers and the parliamentary draftsmen to discuss any specific amendments to the legislation that the Opposition believes are necessary.

<PARA> Senator Stone referred to a letter from the Treasurer to State Premiers. I have a copy of the letter, which was sent on 7 October. Incidentally, it is not signed by the Treasurer but by John Dawkins, the then Acting Chairman of the Loans Council and Acting Treasurer. I want to read the most relevant paragraph of the letter; and it is similar to paragraphs that have been read before. The paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>In exercising the discretion given him under the Bill, my understanding is that the Treasurer would be bound to act in accordance with the terms of any relevant binding agreements entered into by the Commonwealth, including the terms of the Global Approach resolution. This would extend to defining the terms in the Clause in the same manner as in the Global Approach resolution and relying on the procedures embodied in the resolution for consulting with other members of Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the whole letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>7 October 1988</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Premier</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter to the Treasurer of 22 September 1988 concerning the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988, currently before the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis for the payment by the Commonwealth of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance grants that were agreed to at the 12 May 1988 Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> As you will recall, at the Loan Council meeting held on the same day, all States except Queensland agreed to continue to adhere in 1988-89 to the Global Approach to authority borrowings, observing global limits on new money borrowings agreed to at the meeting. In response to Queensland's failure to accept these arrangements, the Treasurer indicated that the Commonwealth would reduce payments of financial assistance grants to Queensland to the extent the State's new money borrowings exceeded a limit of $793 million in 1988-89. This undertaking was reiterated in the Treasurer's letter to the Premier of Queensland of 29 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 of the Bill is designed to place the Commonwealth in a position to give effect to that undertaking in 1988-89, should that become necessary. As is usual in Commonwealth legislation, it is drafted in a non-discriminatory manner to apply to all States. The clause provides that the Treasurer may, if in his opinion a State has exceeded its global borrowing limit for 1988-89 (including the amount of $793 million for Queensland), reduce payments due to a State under the Bill by not more than the amount of the excess. </PARA>
<PARA> In exercising the discretion given him under the Bill, my understanding is that the Treasurer would be bound to act in accordance with the terms of any relevant binding agreements entered into by the Commonwealth, including the terms of the Global Approach resolution. This would extend to defining the terms in the Clause in the same manner as in the Global Approach resolution and relying on the procedures embodied in the resolution for consulting with other members of Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this will allay your concerns about the possible implications of Clause 7 of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, what Senator Stone said about the money is partially correct-that is, that payments can be made to States without the legislation being passed. It is correct for as long as the money in the Supply Bills lasts. I do not know off the top of my head, and I have had no reason at this stage to inquire how much of that is left, but I understand from the Treasury officer present that it runs out some time before the end of this month. If the Senate wants to play games and delay the passage of the Bill beyond that I, as Minister for Finance, can see some advantage to the Commonwealth. If the payments are not made to the States on the monthly basis that is provided for in the legislation, then there will be savings to the Commonwealth Budget on public debt interest. If the Senate wants to do that it is welcome to do so because, firstly, there would be fortuitous savings to the Commonwealth Budget, and secondly, there would be a bit of trouble back in the States which were not getting any money because of the action being taken here. </PARA>

All too often in this place, the Opposition has had to carry this Government's defective legislation with appropriate amendments to get it off the hook. The Opposition has changed its tactics. It is now saying to the Government: `You have the resources of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Attorney-General's Department, the Treasury, and your own special knowledge.

Indeed, the Government was highly critical of the Opposition for suggesting changes to the grants scheme, even suggesting the abolition of the scheme, accompanied by very substantial tax changes. In any event, after severely criticising the Opposition and making all sorts of undertakings to exporters, the Government found itself able to change its mind and to announce the changes that are to be made by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The major changes are as follows: The Bill will raise the threshold for eligible expenditure from $5,000 a year to $10,000 a year. This change is likely to affect smaller businesses, the people who are at the beginnings of export and who may have relatively small amounts of expenditure. The Opposition has never opposed the idea of there being some cut-off point because, obviously, administratively that is very sensible; but this change raises the threshold for eligible expenditure from $5,000 to $10,000 a year. In addition, the maximum annual grant payable to exporters who have received eight grants will be reduced to $150,000, and to $100,000 for those who are in receipt of a tenth or subsequent grant. This will wean comparatively successful importers off the scheme. Maximum grants to exporters after two years will also be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes changes to the treatment of affiliated companies so that they are treated as one unit in the assessment of export grants. That is to reduce the capacity of any related businesses to get grants not subject to those various cut-offs. The change will prevent the restructuring of companies merely to increase access to grants. Finally, because of the development of the single market between New Zealand and Australia under the closer economic relations agreement, the Government has proposed that Australian exporters should not receive assistance in developing New Zealand markets. The Bill provides that export promotion expenditure in New Zealand will no longer be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not propose to oppose this legislation. In the main, we have taken the stance that where the Government moves to reduce expenditure-we have been saying virtually throughout the whole of the life of this Government that it has been spending more than Australian taxpayers can afford, that it has been adding to our debt too much and keeping taxes too high-we will not oppose legislation which reduces government expenditure, even though the changes made may not be changes which we, in government, would make. In other words, we have not sought the capacity to remake the Government's Budget here in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. That commitment, which is very convenient and helpful to the Government, is entirely appropriate, given the economic difficulties that Australia has faced and the difficulties that the Government would face in economic management if there were a substantial remaking of the Budget in dealing with this sort of legislation. So, for that reason, whilst we are highly critical of what the Government is doing, we do not propose to amend this legislation or to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing which needs to be said is that the Opposition, as part of its approach at the last general election, proposed to do away with the export market development grants as part of its own process of expenditure reduction. We took the view that it was far better to significantly reduce government expenditure across the board and to very significantly reduce the tax burden at the same time than to have the churning effect of collecting higher taxes from businesses and individuals and returning those same taxes to them as benefits, with the accompanying losses that are occasioned by the process of both collecting and disbursing the money. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the context of our promise to remove this form of assistance to exporters was that contemporaneously we were proposing to introduce very significant cuts to the company tax rate, initially from 49c in the dollar to 42c, from 1 July 1988, with the intention of getting it down to 38c in the dollar. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember the cries of `Irresponsibility!' that were levelled at the Opposition when we suggested that, although since that time the present Government-I often wonder, Mr Acting Deputy President, how honourable senators like you feel about this-from 1 July 1988 reduced the company tax rate to 39c in the dollar. So, what in the election campaign had been called an act of economic vandalism became something that the Government did itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has financed the reduction in the taxes which are paid by business by increasing the effective tax rates on individual wage and salary earners. So your constituents, Mr Acting Deputy President, are paying an ever higher proportion of their incomes-often meagre incomes-in taxation. That is why they are feeling such a squeeze in their standard of living. That is why they see this Government as being arrogant and out of touch. It can deliver a 10c reduction in the company tax rate from 1 July, but it can say to the wage and salary earners of Australia, `You will have to wait for your tax cuts until just before the next Federal election'. That is the sort of reason why the voters in so many seats which have been such safe Labor seats have chosen to vote for the Liberal Party or the National Party in preference to their traditional allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the offers that were contemporaneously made to exporters by the Opposition was a reduction of the company tax rate. That reduction was not to be accompanied, as this Government has done, by the removal of the very favourable depreciation provisions which business enjoys and which will recoup some of the tax reduction which has been given to them by this Government. It was also part of the Opposition's tax policy to abolish the capital gains tax; to abolish the fringe benefits tax in its entirety, subject only to provisions which would prevent abuse of that; to restore reductions for legitimate business expenses incurred in earning assessable income; and so on. So a very generous package of tax reductions was proposed by the Opposition which would have delivered very considerable benefits to business at the time the export market development grants were being removed. </PARA>
<PARA> We faced at the time a very strong campaign by the Government which sought the votes of exporters by making the point that it certainly was not going to interfere with the export market development grants program. All sorts of statements were made by Government spokesmen prior to the last election, expressing alarm at what the Liberal Party was proposing. For example, the Minister for Trade at the time, Mr Dawkins, chose to write to many businesses on Government letterhead-I do not know who paid for it; perhaps the Labor Party paid for it, but it was obviously a blatantly political letter-expressing his alarm at the Liberal Party's plans for the EMDG and expressly quoting the Liberals' tax policy. That is fine. Mr Dawkins said, `Boosting our exports is vital and scrapping government help for exporters is folly'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) bought into this argument. He gave an assurance that funding for Austrade and the export market development grants scheme would remain intact if the Labor Government were re-elected. The Prime Minister, in his Australian Financial Review luncheon speech in Brisbane on 16 June 1987, attacked what he described as a `visionless statement by the Liberals' to reduce export assistance and quoted the Confederation of Australian Industry. He said, `What Australia desperately needs now is more exports. The export market development grants scheme will give these exporters a vital helping hand, and that is why the third Hawke Government will retain them'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, in trying to understand the scope of the government's commitment to exporters, to refer to a further statement by Mr Dawkins-as I said, the then Minister for Trade-who, in a media release headed `Dawkins Reassures Industry on Hawke Government Support for Export Drive', said on 22 June 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>I have also assured them-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning exporters-</PARA>
<PARA>that we will not undermine their effort by chipping away at the spearhead of Australia's export drive-Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>In that statement we have a commitment to the continuation of the export market development grants scheme. It is in that context that I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Government has misled exporters;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the amendments in this Bill constitute fundamental changes to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) as such, they are a breach of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Trade during the 1987 election campaign, that the scheme would be allowed to run its full course''. </PARA>
<PARA>On this issue, the Labor Party then campaigned in a way which was designed to make it quite clear to exporters that they could rely upon the maintenance of this program. In the May statement, just 10 or 11 months after those statements of the Prime Minister and Mr Dawkins to which I have referred, they found that the Government was not going to keep that promise after all. I think that is typical of the hypocrisy that has been displayed by this Government and its contempt for the electorate. Again, it is the sort of behaviour which has led to the strong electoral backlash which has been experienced by the Government over the last 12 months. Just as the Prime Minister promised that there would be no capital gains tax and later he brought one in, he promised that there would be no whittling away of the scheme and, of course, that is precisely what this legislation is now doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Can it be said that the need for government assistance with respect to exports has come to an end? Is it a fact that the export crisis is over? In 1986 Mr Keating told us that Australia was headed towards the status of a banana republic; and that was because we had this booming growth of our imports and our exports were not keeping up, we had a great trade gap, and our dollar was plunging as a result. Of course, since that time the Government has gained some advantage and Australia has gained some advantage from the change in the terms of trade. Through 1986 we heard nothing from Government Ministers other than that the difficulties Australia faced were difficulties which were caused by the fact that our terms of trade had declined-in other words, people buying our goods overseas were not prepared to pay as much for them as they had paid the year before, and this was giving rise to our great difficulties-ignoring the fact that that has been a continuing difficulty throughout our history. Indeed, since 1951, if we look at that period of very high export prices, we see a graph where there are many dips in our terms of trade. Mr Keating was complaining at one stage of a 9.8 per cent loss in our terms of trade in one year, forgetting that there had been a loss of a very similar magnitude in 1978 during the period of the Fraser Government. I do not remember Mr Keating or the Labor Party regarding that as anything other than an excuse at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> But the really significant point is that the terms of trade have improved since 1986. They have turned down a bit since the middle of this year and that is a worry for Australia as we know that our commodities are essentially very volatile, but we have had a year and a half of good prices. There has been some slackening off since June but we have still had comparatively good prices. In fact, the loss of the value of our exports that Mr Keating was complaining about has been made up. But when we actually look at what is happening in terms of physical trade in goods and services, we see that the position has worsened since 1986. The tragedy is that the period of ease, the period of relief which has been given to Australia by the improvement in the prices which have been paid for our major commodities has been utterly wasted by this Government, because whilst in real terms we have had a growth in the exports of goods and services, we have had an even larger growth in our imports. So in terms of the physical trade in goods and services things are not getting better; they are getting worse. Of course, that means that the export crisis is greater today than it was in 1986. When we look at the physical goods and services we see that any reversal of our terms of trade today will be a far more serious matter because the actual gap between what we sell abroad and what we buy from abroad has widened. </PARA>
<PARA> In real terms exports grew by 5.8 per cent in 1985-86, by 8 1/2 per cent in 1986-87 and by 5.8 per cent last year, with the budget predicting a growth this year of about 6 per cent. Real import growth has been strong, especially last year, with a 9.1 per cent growth, and the Budget forecasts an increase of 9 1/2 per cent this financial year. So in the last financial year we have had a growth of 5.8 per cent in what we sell abroad-that is, in physical terms-and imports go up by 9.1 per cent. There is a 6 per cent increase in what we are likely to sell abroad this year, with the Government predicting a 9 1/2 per cent increase in our imports. So if we combine the two, exports minus imports, the net export growth was negative and the contribution of net exports to gross domestic product (GDP) growth was minus 0.5 per cent in 1987-88. In other words, the net export position made a negative contribution to our GDP and the Budget forecast for 1988-89 is the same. We will have another reduction of half of one per cent in our GDP because of that gap. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in nominal terms-that is, in terms of present value money-the trade balance on goods and services has improved, falling from a deficit of $7 1/2 billion in 1985-86 to a deficit of $3 billion in 1987-88, if the value of the terms of trade improvement is added to this latter figure, the nominal deficit is around $6 billion. Without the pick-up in commodity prices there has been little improvement on the goods and services trade account as confirmed by the net export figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of all that to this legislation is that this Government is reducing assistance to exporters without providing accompanying tax relief, which, of course, is the proposition that we were providing, without many of the measures that we were putting forward at the same time, in breach of its clear undertakings to exporters; and the country is facing continuing difficulties. There are a number of difficulties for exporters in what is proposed. Take, for example, the removal of assistance to people who are exporting to New Zealand. I have had direct representations from constituents on this. The truth is that if people were relying upon what the Government had said and decided that they were going to open up their export trade to New Zealand and they were prepared to budget-as certainly one constituent who came in and showed me the figures was; the figures showed that a market in foodstuffs could be opened up in New Zealand and, provided the grants were paid, the whole thing looked like a reasonable economic proposition-and they set down that course and went down that track, they would wake up on the morning after the May statement and would find that their budget had been invalidated. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is not retrospective in a technical sense but it certainly alters the basis on which people were carrying out their commercial planning when they were expanding exports relying on the promises of Mr Hawke and Mr Dawkins. At the moment there are some very sour exporters in Australia who did rely-I do not know why they did, given Mr Hawke's record on breaking promises-on the undertakings of Mr Hawke and Mr Dawkins and who now find that their budgets have been invalidated and that the basis on which they went into exports will certainly not be as good for them as it would have been had the Government not made these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> So our concern about this legislation is that it is typical of the mishmash, episodic way that this Government goes about so much of its legislation that impacts upon business activity. It is not only in this field of exports. Look at the absolute plight of so many people in the motor industry over the last three years-an industry which, over the last 12 months, has happily seen a lift in sales. Look at the pain which has been imposed on many of the people in that industry by the fact that, on the one hand, the Government has produced a motor plan which has opened up the industry to greater competition and which is aiming to provide cheaper vehicles for Australian people and, on the other hand, the Government has turned round and imposed increases in sales tax, changes to the arrangements with respect to the fringe benefits tax and so on and an interest rates policy which is absolutely punishing, which has contributed to the smashing down of the market for motor vehicles over several years. It is that lack of consistency, that lack of a framework which overall can be relied upon, which is at the heart of our criticism of this legislation. This is a Government which in our view has maintained unconscionably high taxes. It has, over the course of its life, been unconscionably high spending. It is not the role of the Opposition in our view to force up government expenditure in this country. For that reason, as I said earlier, we will not be voting against this legislation, but I believe that the Senate should record as its view that the Government has misled exporters, that it has fundamentally changed the export market development grants scheme, and that it has breached the undertakings of both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1988. I do this bearing in mind the increasing importance and necessity of Australia and its position in export trade. I need to start at the beginning because export potential is totally tied to the country's overall economic position. The discussion has to proceed on the basis and in the light of our current overseas balances, our interest rate, our taxation policies, our currency values, our employment levels, the seasonal conditions, our industrial relations, and so on. All those things have a bearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to pick out only one of those at this stage. Two reports have been produced this year, one by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) and one by Price Waterhouse. Instructions were given in January 1988 for these two organisations to complete their reports. There has been a considerable change in the economic situation since then. There has been a considerable change in the value of the currency since then. There is a lot of difference in how we view the world and how the world views us. It makes a lot of difference, for instance, whether our dollar is worth US65 cents or US70 cents or whether it is pumped up to 82 cents, as it is now. Even the changes that have occurred since January this year would make a lot of difference to anybody seeking to be in the export market. We also need to consider initially the import question. Senator Chaney, my leader, spoke on this matter. I have today's figures from the Daily Commercial News. The news article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Imports increased by $192m to $3,825m from $3,632m in July and $3,232m in June. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first two months of the 1988-89 financial year, the value of imports increased by 15.8% to $7,457m from $6,439m in July and August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> For the three months ended August 1988 imports increased by 11.0% on the same period of last year, which was nearly double the rise of 5.9% recorded for exports. </PARA>
<PARA>How long can we go on with a rise in imports or a rise that is twice as steep as the rise in exports? Can we continue on this basis? How can we ignore the value of the American dollar at the same time? That seems to be the currency by which we are gauged around the world. If we continue up this road how close are we to going out backwards and hanging the sign on the door saying that we have gone? We must build our exports and we must produce new exporters, and lots of them. I ask the Government: Will this Bill do that? Is it what is required to be done? Were the people who did these reviews instructed to move in and see by how much they could cut the money?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the indicators from the history of the scheme. In the review of the Bureau of Industry Economics table 2.1 demonstrates that in 1978-79 there were 3,918 claimants. In 1986-87 there were 3,530 claimants, actually less than in the first year I mentioned. That was, of course, after we had been through years like 1982-83 when there were 6,535 claimants and 1983-84 when there were 6,387 claimants. Those were years when we were trying to build up exports. Now we are on the slippery slide and going down rapidly. The number of people who are eligible to claim under this new scheme is also going down rapidly. This is before the latest reductions. All we know is that the scheme is due to be wound up on 30 June 1990. It looks as though we will try to wind it up before then. The circumstances have changed since the Government decided to take this action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that table 2.3 on page 8 of the same publication demonstrates that of the 3,530 claimants, 2,007 were in manufacturing, 745 were in wholesale and retail, and 286 were in finance, property and business services. It also shows that of the groups which carry the Australian export market, agriculture had 97 claimants and mining had 52. Although those sectors produce in the order of 80 per cent of exports the numbers of claimants is very small. Over the period I have mentioned the average claim has risen from $15,300 to $50,500. Who is exporting?</PARA>
<PARA> We need to have a fresh look at the whole system. If we are to increase our export effort we have to have new exporters, new markets and new products. Those questions were identified by the two groups that did the investigation. Both commented on the same points. I will read from a couple of areas of the publication by the Bureau of Industry Economics. On page 18 it referred to new exporters in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>If the measure of the extent of assistance provided to new exporters is taken to be the number of claimants who have received less than three grants, then this objective has been met quite well. More than 40 per cent of the claimants in 1986-87 fall into this category. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional indicator is that some 2,500 firms have been encouraged into attempting export market development through the Scheme in the last nine years. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to talk about new markets on page 19. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The data suggests that, on average, more new markets are entered by firms in their early years in the Scheme than in later years. Average new markets appear to be greater for firms in their first year, as would be expected, but from the second year to the eighth year, an average of one new market per year per claimant appears to be being developed. After the eighth year new market development, on average, declines markedly. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on about new products. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Encouragement of new products is not achieved very well by the Scheme. The data suggest that development of new products appears, on average, to be minimal after claimants have been in the Scheme longer than one year. </PARA>
<PARA>It shows that the scheme, whatever its intentions, is not working to get to the people we are really after. I am sure that the changes we are proposing will not bring in a new group of exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions, also on page 19 of that report, briefly are:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, assistance has been provided to:</PARA>
<PARA> established exporters who were not developing new markets . . . </PARA>
<PARA> exporters to areas such as New Zealand which are little different to Australia for the purposes of market development; and</PARA>
<PARA> exporters who are not as committed as is necessary for success in exporting. </PARA>
<PARA>It is rather unfortunate that we seem to have reached the position where we are paying many of the people who, according to these reports, did not need the money or were not using it wisely. But back to exports. The aims of any export stimulation scheme very clearly have to be to encourage industry to export; to achieve export income; to expand Australia's productivity; to extend the skills of Australians; and to improve the living standards of all Australians. Looking at the same list of desirable objectives of the BIE report, it summarises them quite well. I again quote those:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . objectives which the EMDG Scheme should possess can be developed. These are that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Scheme should concentrate on new exporters and on small to medium-sized firms;</PARA>
<PARA> firms should spend a significant amount of their own funds on market development;</PARA>
<PARA> an export performance test should be applied that provides an incentive for the firm to export after a reasonable time spent in market development;</PARA>
<PARA> assistance should be given for the development of markets in countries about which potential exporters have the greatest difficulty estimating the costs and benefits of export market development;</PARA>
<PARA> firms should be required to provide an export plan;</PARA>
<PARA> the external benefits generated by exporters should be readily available to potential exporters;</PARA>
<PARA> the Scheme should be administratively efficient for both claimants and the Government;</PARA>
<PARA> the Scheme should complement other AUSTRADE and Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce Industry Programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> enough information should be collected from those using and administering this Scheme that its effectiveness can be readily measured. </PARA>
<PARA>That is good. These guidelines are most reasonable. How do we achieve them? To achieve what we are trying to do must lie basically with new exports, because once in, the problems are somewhat less. The encouragement of new exports is vital. Most of all, continuity is absolutely essential. Knowing what the Government will do is absolutely fundamental. Of course, we do know what the Government will do because it has told us over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney made mention of what Mr Dawkins said that the Government would do. I do not wish to repeat all of the excellent material that Mr Dawkins has provided us with. He did say that scrapping Government help for exporters is folly. I completely agree, particularly when one has promised them one will not-it is folly. Then, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) saw fit to quote Mr Daryl George, the Chief Executive of the Confederation of Australian Industry, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Stability and certainty in the formation and implementation of industry policies are crucial. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said, `Good old Mr George, we support you totally'. But did he support him totally? Of course he did not. Before the ink was dry he said, `Oh no, the election is over. We've won that. We don't have to run for the train once we've caught it. We'll see what we can do to rip the rug out from under these exporters. If we play our cards right we can save $52m'. That is what the whole program has been about. So much for that. </PARA>
<PARA> To get new exporters requires, of course, the best market information that one can provide. It requires researching of the niches and the opportunities all over the world. It requires appropriate credit and insurance facilities. These have to be easily operated. It requires the availability of literature, staff, seminars, et cetera to aid the decision making and to reduce the high initial costs and risk that are associated with going into something that is unknown, and the meeting of costs adequately through tax issues and other means. The package that we in Opposition and in coalition put out at that time covered all of those things. What has the Government done? I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally I do not rise on the adjournment but I ask the indulgence of you, Mr President, and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). I will be raising a couple of topics but I will be as brief as I can. They are two quite different cases. One involves a woman who, after being left a widow, remarried in 1964. The couple went to live on her property. In 1977 she was diagnosed as having a brain tumour and her condition was regarded as terminal. While under treatment in hospital and heavily sedated at the time, she signed over to her husband the property and her other funds so that he could administer them. She was not, I remind the Minister, expected to survive this operation. However, in some ways perhaps unfortunately, she did. Senator Patterson is laughing but she will find out why I suspect this woman would have preferred not to have lived given the problems that occurred thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She arranged to return home to convalesce. When she did her husband told her that he did not want her to come back to the property which now belonged to him and that furthermore he had, `another woman in her bed'. There was not a great deal that she could do apparently. She was sent some money by her only daughter and son-in-law to go and recuperate with them overseas, ultimately in the United Kingdom. Some months later in 1978 she returned to Adelaide to find that her husband had divorced her and claimed ownership of all her property. She then went on a pension. In addition, she took presumably part time casual postings as a teacher in a local high school and filled out the rest of her time with some voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA> Friends of hers, who were somewhat angry at her husband's behaviour and use of her property, persuaded her to take action to repossess that property or at least get half its value, with the help of legal aid. With the help of the Legal Services Commission in South Australia, a law firm was eventually appointed to take up her case. As sometimes happens, it apparently did not seem too enthusiastic about it and after a couple of years passed the case on to an associate law firm, which a year later-by this time it is 1988-presented the case, allegedly incompletely, advising her to say nothing in court. Meantime her husband, who was quite significantly wealthy, managed to get the services of a barrister who put his case well, arguing among other things that, as the case had not come up in court within a year of the divorce, it was not admissible. There being no apparent objection from the Legal Services people representing her, the judge dismissed the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The woman is now over 70, living in a little flat and making as much of her life as she can. Her friends have asked a series of questions which, if the above information is accurate, deserve some kind of answer. When she was in court, why did her legal adviser not stress that this appeal limit of a year was quite unrealistic under the circumstances? Why did her legal adviser not hold out for the usual fifty-fifty settlement in marital divisions, given-I remind the Senate-that she was divorced when she was out of the country and was not able to be present? Why was not any emphasis placed on the conditions under which she signed the original documents giving her husband jurisdiction to administer her property?</PARA>
<PARA> I would be grateful to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) if he could give some advice or recommend some way of solving the problem. I am personally at a loss to see how anybody can help this woman. Clearly an injustice has been perpetrated, and if the Minister knows of any way at all in which she can be helped, I am quite happy to give him the name and address of the woman concerned. I certainly do not want it to be put in the Hansard records. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case is a more general one. I guess it is one that a lot of other senators would have run into from time to time. It concerns a loophole in or a misuse of Australia's overseas students program and our immigration system. The particular case involves a young woman who arrived in Australia in 1984 with her husband and two children to enable her husband to commence postgraduate studies at an Australian university. Shortly after the family's arrival the husband became involved with another woman, an Australian citizen, whom he subsequently married following the couple's divorce in 1986. After his remarriage the man applied for and was granted permanent resident status in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> He then withdrew from his course of study-the reason, I remind everybody, that he was granted permission to come into the country in the first place-and has, I have been told although I have not been able to verify this, left his second wife. His marriage to her, of course, enabled him to obtain permission to remain as a permanent resident, having got in here in the first place as a PhD student at an Australian university. In the meantime, of course, his former wife and their children automatically became prohibited non-citizens upon dissolution of the marriage and have been advised that they must leave the country. For some time the woman has been trying to gain permission for herself and her children to remain in Australia but, fairly obviously, to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot be held responsible, obviously, for the breakdown of the marriage and the subsequent difficulties flowing from such an occurrence, but I think it can take some responsibility for, or at least it ought to be concerned about, a situation which allows individuals to work the system to their own advantage with such apparent ease. Marriage is the major ground by which overseas students apply for change of status under section 6a (1) (b) of the Migration Act and the majority of applications are granted. The process is very simple. The applicant fills in the relevant application form and presents his or her marriage certificate, along with four statutory declarations from people supporting the fact that the couple are living together in a marital relationship. Evidence of bank accounts and so on is also required. If the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is made aware before the application is approved that the marriage has broken down, then the application will be refused. However, once approval has been granted for a change of status on the basis of this marriage, as far as the Department appears to be concerned the matter is closed. If it does come to the notice of the Department after a person has been granted permanent resident status that the relationship has not turned out to be ongoing, there is apparently nothing anybody can or will do. The only way that person can be returned to his country of origin is if he has knowingly not declared an illness or if it is found that he has a criminal record. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened here is that the law as it stands has enabled this man to shirk his responsibilities as a parent, leaving his former wife to return to the country of origin to support and raise the children alone, while he on the other hand settles down to life in a country where presumably there are greater advantages open to him than in the country of his birth. In a way, I suppose, it is a shame that his wife is not to be granted the opportunity to share in those advantages, but I guess this is a double bind for the Government. If she is granted the opportunity to stay and is given permanent resident status, then presumably the man is at liberty to divorce his second wife, remarry the first one, and they both, with the children, have got permanent resident status. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two financial years 952 overseas students have been granted permanent resident status by reason of marriage. I do not have any available statistics prior to 1986, because they were not computerised until then, but I believe that that is an extraordinary number of students suddenly discovering a romantic attachment that leads to marriage, which then leads to permanent resident status, and that there is no requirement at all for there to be any proof that the relationship was sufficiently bona fide for it to be a lasting one. I do not know what we can do, but it is obviously happening more often than the Government would want. Again I would appreciate it if the Government could take this on board and have a look at some way by which two good systems-our overseas students program and our immigration system-are not joined together and rorted, as is obviously happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Requests for Tender were issued to two Australian based consortia for the construction of up to 12 ANZAC frigates (8 ships for Australia and 4 ships for New Zealand). Tenders are to be submitted by 19 January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The project is on schedule, it is planned that the production contract be awarded in mid 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A joint project was established for the ANZAC ships between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the respective Ministers for Defence of the two countries on 6 March 1987. The MOU is a memorandum of intent, it is not binding on either party.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the MOU New Zealand had the right to withdraw from the joint project at two milestone decision points in the project, i.e. after ship design selection, (February 1988) and after evaluation of tenders for the construction contract (about the second quarter of 1989). New Zealand did not exercise the right in February 1988 and is still in the joint project.</PARA>
<PARA> If New Zealand does not continue its participation in the joint project there would be a consequential effect on the work in Australian dockyards, as well as New Zealand industry. These cannot be quantified until tenders are received and evaluated.</PARA>
