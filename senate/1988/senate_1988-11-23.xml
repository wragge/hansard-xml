<TITLE>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Australia is one nation which comprises people from many different racial and cultural backgrounds;</PARA>
<PARA> That a Treaty with one of these peoples-the Aborigines-would be divisive and would be equivalent to the setting up of a separate nation;</PARA>

<TITLE>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That it be recognised the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill is a public, legal acknowledgement that Australians who are non-aboriginal do not have sovereignty in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the Australian people are opposed to the idea of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Australian people who are non-aboriginal and those who are aboriginal, and the Government has no mandate or authority to pursue it.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the proposed legislation and treaty</PARA>
<PARA> will damage Australia's position under international law and in any conflict,</PARA>
<PARA> will cause distrust and conflict between our aboriginal population (1%) and the non-aboriginal population (99%),</PARA>
<PARA> will extend aboriginal land rights, contrary to the wishes of the Australian people,</PARA>
<PARA> will not be acceptable to the aboriginal people themselves,</PARA>
<PARA> will solve none of the problems of aboriginal people who need housing, health services, education and employment.</PARA>
<PARA>That therefore, the Senate reject absolutely the announced proposals for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, and the negotiation of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Commonwealth and aboriginal people.</PARA>

<PARA> That we strongly object to the contents of the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' on the grounds that it is blasphemous, offensive and obnoxious.</PARA>
<PARA> It is deplorable that the Commonwealth Films Board of Review downgraded the film's classification to ``M'', mature audiences.

<TITLE>General and Recreational Aircraft: Charges</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled, we, the users of Archerfield Airport and Electors in this Senate, humbly petition and respectfully request:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the F.A.C. be restrained from imposing the proposed charges against General Aviation and Recreational Aircraft at certain Secondary Airports and that the existing levy on Aviation Fuel be used to finance any shortfall between F.A.Cs. expenditure and income. The following facts show why that restraint should be imposed on F.A.C.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Total cost recovery as outlined in the Bosch Report, was to be achieved over a period of Ten Years, this cost recovery has already been achieved and exceeded at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The levy on Aviation Fuel was, after consultation and agreement by G.A., implemented to take the place of A.N.Cs., which covered landing fees, parking, etc., for which F.A.C. now proposes to make a charge.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) D.o.T.C., C.A.A. and F.A.C. provide services and maintenance that, largely, is neither required nor wanted by the majority of Secondary Airport Users, rationalisation of these services and maintenance would allow portion of the fuel levy, now paid toward this overservicing, to be allocated to F.A.C.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The exaggerated proposed expenditure figures as presented by Mr. Barry Thompson of F.A.C. to meetings of Airport users are clearly not based on fact; An honest assessment would show greatly reduced figures which would more closely approach the current income that F.A.C. now obtains, without the need for any additional charges.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Implementation of further charges against G.A. Aircraft at Secondary Airports will inevitably effect the viability of business operating at these Airports, as aircraft will be removed to satellite Aerodromes. (eg) Maintenance organisations and flying schools</PARA>
<PARA> (7) If Secondary Airports were to have charges almost comparable to Primary Airports, then certainly, congestion at Primary Airports would increase; Therefore some form of cross subsidisation from Primary to Secondary Airports, is both warranted and desirable.</PARA>

<TITLE>Graduate Tax</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament the petition of the undersigned shows that we oppose the introduction of the graduate tax, recognising it as a discriminatory piece of legislation which will, in particular, greatly disadvantage women, that it will act as a disincentive to women's participation in Tertiary Education and set back women's battle for equal opportunity, that Women Graduates are lower paid and therefore will suffer this flat rate fee disproportionately, and that the whole economic approach of the green and white papers and the Graduate Tax will discourage the development of those areas of study where women are now concentrated, which are of such great cultural and social value. Your Petitioners therefore ask that you reject the proposals contained in the white paper and specifically, that you reject the introduction of the graduate tax.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) takes cognizance of the fact that, while Mr Hawke says that the bases are for verification purposes, it has been clearly established that they play an essential part in the USA first strike capability;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) condemns these moves by the Government which, instead of serving the interests of ourselves and our partners as the Prime Minister would have us believe, effectively tie Australia to the vagaries of the USA foreign policy for another 10 years and ensure that Australia remains a Soviet military target for that time and, therefore, do not represent Australia's interests at all;</PARA>

<PARA> (f) condemns, further, the Prime Minister's statement that nobody seriously committed to peace could argue for the closure of the bases, and expresses concern at these attempts to undermine and denigrate the work of the Australian peace movement and its success in bringing the public's attention to the real functions of the defence facilities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) urges the Government, if it is seriously committed to peace and to serving the interests of Australia, to close the bases or, as an acceptable alternative, to open them up completely for international verification and staff them with the many experienced and highly trained scientists in this country who are skilled in the science of verification so that Australian may truly contribute to the diminishing of nuclear weaponry in this world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Casino Control Ordinance 1988, as contained in Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No. 4 of 1988 and made under the Christmas Island Act 1958, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Christmas Island that we are concerned with is the one near Indonesia, 360 kilometres from Java Head, and is not its namesake, which has been used for nuclear testing. It is a volcanic island which rises out of the ocean. There are cliffs, rich topsoil and a rather depleted area of unique rainforest. Until the mid-1970s the island was simply a source of cheap phosphates for fertilisers. This changes because of two things: the decline in international phosphate prices and the unionisation of the Christmas Island work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The story of the Union of Christmas Island Workers deserves to be told and is relevant, as said the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Indeed, this story has been told. The quotation from the Prime Minister comes from the dust jacket of a book by Les Waters, lecturer at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the story of how a small union in a remote and little-known Australian territory changed the status of its members from that of indentured labourers on Asian rates of pay to employees enjoying permanent residency and mainland pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> This revolution was not achieved easily. In the end, however, solidarity, resolution and intelligent campaigning over a long period and a tough, competent and committed leadership won through. </PARA>
<PARA> The Union of Christmas Island Workers story deserves to be told. </PARA>
<PARA>R. J. HAWKE. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from a book which was published in 1983 and which relates the whole complex story of the Christmas Island phosphates mine: how it was closed by the Government, how the workers set up a fund to reopen it, and how it was adopted as a speculative enterprise by one of our beer barons-not even a Western Australian beer baron but a multinational and Victorian beer baron. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to bear this story in mind when we look at the question of a casino on Christmas Island. The people of Christmas Island, just like the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), once had a form of elected self-government in traditional Australian style; that is, they had an assembly which was elected by Senate-style proportional representation, which, of course, is what the Australian Democrats and most people of political goodwill would argue is the most appropriate for the ACT. However, the Assembly on Christmas Island bucked the Government and protested loud and long-in the first place about `Australian labour at Asian rates'. It protested about the running of the island by the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd for the benefit of the company. The Assembly's members asserted their rights as Australians, and they objected in particular to the exploitation of particularly sensitive areas of rainforest on the island. It was for this dangerous display of independent thinking that the Christmas Island Assembly was duly dissolved. </PARA>
<PARA> This meant that the people of the island now have no elected voice. There is no way they can currently express their opinion through their elected representatives. I would like to quote from newspaper articles written in 1986, more than two years ago. The first is from the Canberra Times of 22 April 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>Christmas Islanders have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a $30 million casino resort. </PARA>
<PARA> In a referendum at the weekend, 93 per cent voted Yes to the proposal, which would provide about 350 jobs directly and another 200 in secondary services. </PARA>
<PARA> The island's Assembly called the referendum after islanders signed a petition to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But the 1,000 islanders are optimistic that a casino can make their homeland a tourist attraction, if it is included in a package tour including perhaps the Cocos Islands . . . and Bali or Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in the Australian Financial Review of 24 April 1986, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Christmas islanders are becoming increasingly incensed over what they see as delays in approving new projects for the island. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the island's governing body, Mr Gordon Bennett, said on his way to Canberra yesterday that the Federal Government's apathy smacked of racism-`if a European community was involved, action would have been taken long ago'. </PARA>
<PARA> The islanders want approval for a $30 million casino and tourist complex that they hope will reduce unemployment, when phosphate production is cut by half at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Without a new venture, 300 of the island's mostly Chinese population of 2,500, will be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> He-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Bennett-</PARA>
<PARA>was critical of long delays in the Department of Territories, over several major development applications for the island. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In the past five years, the Federal Government had conducted three inquiries in the island's future; All had advocated tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in the Australian Financial Review of 18 June 1986, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is expected to approve a $30 million casino-hotel complex for Christmas Island next week. </PARA>
<PARA> The island, long a major source of phosphate for the Australian farming industry, faces economic ruin as this resource is exhausted in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to build the complex has been approved by a Cabinet sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Canberra sources it will be considered by Cabinet on Monday. </PARA>
<PARA> The casino, a 262-room hotel, and a small marina will be built by a Perth company, F. P. Woodmore Pty Ltd, funded through the Benwood Property Trust, and operated by Federal Pacific Hotels Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>We are looking at a history of events dating back two years. We are now two years down the track. This proposal has not been set up. And there is no longer an assembly of elected representatives for the people of Christmas Island. It seems that the Government has embarked on a deliberate policy to depopulate the island while at the same time seeking to maintain a presence on the island. The contradiction can be overcome only by removing the present permanent residents and replacing them with selected mainland employees. There is some hard evidence to the effect that former Minister Brown regarded this somewhat inhuman policy as desirable. I will quote from a departmental memo dated June 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Former Minister Brown agreed to an extension of time to commence and complete construction of the hotel-casino on the basis of:</PARA>
<PARA>the upheaval on Christmas Island with the abolition of the Christmas Island Assembly and the closure of the phosphate mine; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Department's wish to slow down development to ensure that the existing population could be persuaded to leave earlier rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me remind honourable senators that these people are Australian citizens on Australian soil, however remote from the comfortable suburban gardens of Canberra. I wish to quote as well from a letter I received not too many days ago from a social worker on Christmas Island who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I ask that you support us in requesting the Government continues to provide English language classes for the majority of non-English speaking, long term residents of Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to explain that the English language program was introduced in 1986 and was run by the technical and further education sector. She said that now the program is being discontinued because the Islanders are being told that funds are no longer forthcoming. So I ask: Is this too part of the plan to depopulate the island, or at least remove the old employees of the phosphate mine with their troublesome union and independent-minded Assembly and replace them with a more biddable group of hotel or casino employees?</PARA>
<PARA> The citizens of Canberra are indignant because they feel, and quite rightly so, that the Federal Government is attempting to impose a casino on them before they have their elections for their own assembly-which we all hope will be early next year. The citizens of Christmas Island are similarly indignant. We in the Australian Democrats do not contest the need for Australia to maintain a presence on this far-flung outpost of our empire. However, we contest most strongly the bringing forward of the Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance at a time when there are no elected representatives of the people of Christmas Island to monitor the setting up of any potential casino development. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an alternative to the casino proposal which I wish to put before the Senate. Christmas Island is a beautiful tropical island. Geographically, it is a part of Asia. The people there are of Chinese and Malay origins and some are of European origin. The Muslim Malays, incidentally, are strongly and traditionally opposed to casino gambling for religious and cultural reasons. They have exotic customs and eat exotic food, but they are all Australians. One does not need a passport to go there, there are no international hassles, there is no need for travellers cheques and there is no need for international incidents. It is, in fact, one more Australian territory. I have had quite a few conversations-and they were very courteous-with Mr Frank Woodmore, the proposed developer. When I quoted a paragraph in his proposed development brochure back to him recently he said that the paragraph was written for the sole purpose of encouraging would-be investors. If he could stretch the truth to would-be investors, can we not believe that the facts are so? We in this place are concerned not just with the future of developers but with the future of an island and its population. I quote from Mr Woodmore's brochure:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . even without a casino licence, Christmas Island Casino Resort would be an attractive proposition. The potential for general tourism is great. The visitor will discover many fascinating features on Christmas Island which cannot be found elsewhere. As a resort, the project is financially attractive.</PARA>
<PARA>What future do we advocate for the island? Clearly, in the first instance, the Islanders themselves must be consulted. The Christmas Island Assembly, which was dissolved by the Federal Government, through the Minister, should be re-established. As with the current spate of referendum proposals for Canberra, it is no use having polls or elections if the voters are kept uninformed. It is the view of the Democrats that no new mining should take place on the island but that the mine tailings should be worked out until they are of no further value, at the same time as a serious program of rehabilitation over the previously mined areas takes place. The national park area of the island must be extended to include all the known habitat and especially the nesting sites of the endangered species on the island-that is, the frigatebirds, the boobies and hawk-owls. We are sure that, in the long term, sensitive tourist development will enable Australia to maintain a presence on the island, enable the endangered species once again to flourish, and provide work in the industry and ancillary services for the residents of the island. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be a casino on the island, it is not appropriate for the Senate to impose that on the people while they do not have their elected representatives to monitor it. As I pointed out in my speech on the proposed ACT casino, the one small business which has come to flourish in my home city of Perth since the establishment of the casino there is that of the pawnbroker. The drugs, prostitution and street crime are accepted by independent and searching inquiries such as the Connor Board of Inquiry into Casinos to be par for the course. On Christmas Island we could perhaps delete the street crime and add fauna smuggling. Christmas Island, like the Australian Capital Territory, is at a turning point. In both cases that turning point has been brought about by a government which refuses to listen to its own electors. A duly elected Assembly was dissolved and the people were denied any representation. In both cases I believe that the Government, with supreme arrogance, is attempting to foist a casino on a people which in one case is unwilling and in the other has no currently elected Assembly to speak for it. In the case of Christmas island there has been neither an environmental impact study nor a social impact study. </PARA>
<PARA> Any consideration of any development, whether it be tourism, with or without a casino, whether it be military-and I believe that there possibly is a case for some kind of low scale Australian presence there-or whether it be continued mining, must take into account the fate of the birds I mentioned previously: the boobies, the frigatebirds and the hawk owls. I hope that we are sufficiently enlightened in 1988-even our chemical spraying coalition colleagues-to realise that we do not have the right to cause the extinction of another species. We share this world and, indeed, I would say that we borrow it from the future. On the face of it, I guess the island could benefit from no human presence at all from that point of view and the web of life, which we have torn and tattered, could repair a little corner of itself. </PARA>
<PARA> But Christmas Island is populated, it is part of Australia and the people on it are Australians. It would be possible, I guess, for us to pass legislation forbidding human presence on the island, but we are not proposing that at all. It does seem that the Australian Government wishes to maintain a presence on the island and this presence for a long while, as I said before, took the form of a phosphate mine-even long after the mine ceased to be economic. There has been the suggestion, at least, that the island has an increasingly important military purpose. It was part of Project Flowerless, according to Des Ball, which was an ocean bed surveillance system designed to spy on South East Asia, especially Indonesia. Certainly, as I said before, the island has an obvious strategic importance in terms of the major sea lanes which pass near it on the way to Australian ports. A newspaper cartoonist expressed the point nicely quite recently. The clip to the cartoon said, `Trouble on Christmas Island? Send in a Casino!'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we maintain our presence through a casino, a phosphate mine or an out-and-out military base, why does it have an overriding importance? It is because our presence on the island gives us a toehold in South East Asia, a forward listening post, or is it because our presence above the waterline enormously increases our legal access to the seabed, with its huge reserves of oil and gas? So what do we do to maintain our presence at this outpost of our civilisation? Do we need to send in a casino?</PARA>
<PARA> During the recent debate on the subject of a casino in this beautiful city of Canberra, I did raise many objections to casinos as such. Honourable senators will be happy to know that I do not propose to go through them again. But I do note that during that debate there was little attempt to refute points which I made about the social effects of casino gambling. Clearly the situation on Christmas Island is different from that in Canberra. One of the most telling arguments against a casino in Canberra is simply that it is this nation's capital, a place of dignity and some beauty, that a gambling casino is simply inappropriate and that tacky commercialism would be an unhappy graft on the precincts of our Parliament. But would a casino be appropriate for Christmas Island? The proponents of the casino do point out that a casino already exists on the island, the Poon Saan Club, which has provided an outlet for the alleged urge to gamble amongst members of the Chinese community. It is asserted that this gambling club has no social consequences; indeed, it has been pointed out to me that the Chinese residents on the island use gambling in a sense to launder money because they believe that some percentage of their income is always derived from the misfortune of another and that if they use this money to gamble and then win, the unluckiness of that money has been washed away. That is quite interesting anthropological material, but I am not convinced that a Chinese gambling club, however effective in bringing good luck, is a relevant precedent to a hotel casino. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate on the proposed casino for the Australian Capital Territory, much mention was made of the almost certain connection between casinos and organised crime. Casino proponents denied this suggestion or claimed that with adequate surveillance there would be no problem. It has also been stated that on Christmas Island surveillance is easier because, as access to the island is only by air, it is that much easier to monitor who comes in. However, a recent article in the Age of 11 November, under the headline `Casino tours attracting criminals, say police,' stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Overseas organised crime figures were trying to use casino tours to enter and operate in Australia, a senior police officer said in New Zealand yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> An assistant commissioner of the Western Australian Police, Mr Max Marshall, told the Australasian Crime Conference in Wellington that a group of Thai criminals had sought entry to Western Australia as gambling-tour operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The group had links with heroin trafficking, illegal immigration, prostitution and social security fraud. Two tour operators were believed to be involved in two murders in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Marshall said that while people applying to become casino tour operators were checked by police, the controls were not `totally effective'. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators firstly, that, this was a police survey of casino tour operators, not casino operators; and, secondly, that this survey uncovered only those operators, probably only the tiniest tip of the iceberg, who were actually caught with their fingers in the till. Most of the criminal figures, as we all know, would not go anywhere near the sort of petty crime which this survey indicates. I with to quote the shadow Minister for the environment, David Connolly, as reported in Hansard for 12 March 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the trade in wildlife is a particularly lucrative business. It has been said that it is now as lucrative as drug trafficking. In fact, both operations tend to go hand in hand, with the same Asian routes being used to smuggle birds and other wildlife out of Australia, and to bring in drugs on the return journey. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is strong evidence that the rich rewards available to wildlife traffickers have led to the involvement of internationally organised criminals. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that these arguments have not been refuted. I believe that casinos and organised crime go together, hand in glove. I believe that, as far as the situation on Christmas Island is concerned, because of the wildlife and fauna there, this matter is something to be particularly cautious about. Finally, I wish to quote a letter written to the editor of the Australian by Mr R. J. Ellicott, QC, a former Minister for the Australian Capital Territory and a judge of the New South Wales courts. The letter, which appeared on 26 February 1988, was headed: `SOS for Christmas Island'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>As an Australian and a former minister responsible for the administration of Christmas Island I would like to protest at the treatment now being meted out to our people there. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Although under a generally benevolent administration since the 1950s the fact is that the people of Christmas Island have been exploited over the years for the benefit of the rest of us. A great injustice is now being done to them. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I refuse to believe that this island, situated where it is, a stone's throw from Asia, with tourist, postal and other earning potential, cannot provide a future in work and relative prosperity for its people. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is we have not applied our best minds and efforts to the task and we are taking the easy way out. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Senate will not take the easy way out. I hope that we can be involved in reinstating the elected assembly to speak on behalf of the local Christmas Islanders and that they can address this issue for themselves and set up, in the way that they think fit, the best format of tourism operation for their island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that Senator Jenkins's hope is going to be a forlorn one, because the Opposition will be joining the Government to allow the Christmas Island casino to become a fact. We will do that for a number of reasons. The basic reason is that we want to offer a future and job prospects for the 1,000 islanders remaining on Christmas Island. Over the last two years the population has decreased from about 4,000 to a little under 1,000. The people who left did not want to get off the island. They were forced off it because there were no jobs, there was no future for their children, and there were no prospects. They were virtually taking in each other's washing and living on the dole. There were only a few service jobs on the island. There was massive unemployment for the remaining islanders. This side of the chamber cannot and will not tolerate that if there is another option open. A number of people have strong opinions against casinos; there would be a number in this Parliament. But the fact remains that in a referendum held on 19 April 1986 Christmas Islanders were asked to cast a vote on the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Do you approve of the hotel/casino proposal for Christmas Island?</PARA>
<PARA>That question was asked in English, Chinese, and Malay. At the time there were 1,298 eligible voters; 1,172 were on the island on polling day and the number who voted was 955. Ninety-three per cent of those 955 people cast their vote for a casino as their only opportunity of sustaining their way of life and not living on hand outs, sit-down money or the dole. </PARA>

When the Assembly was sitting, it was a unanimous vote of the elected representatives of the people that they wanted a casino. Senator Jenkins comes into the Senate and tries to impose her will and the will of her party over the 93 per cent of the Christmas Islanders. The Democrats then had the audacity to stand up and propose a citizens' initiative referendum and fly right in the face of what the people want. I made a promise to myself that I would not be mean to the Democrats, that I would keep right away from that. But I cannot for the life of me understand how they can stand up in the Senate and say, `We want a citizens' initiative referendum' and in the next breath say, `We are not going to take cognisance of 93 per cent of the people on Christmas Island'. It is an absolute nonsense. I see Senator Robert Ray laughing and I can see the joke of it too because they have been caught out of bounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go into some other reasons why there is a need for a casino. Three inquiries have been called to map out a future for Christmas Island. Expressions of interest were called for and I understand that the only person who put his name forward was a Mr Woodmore, who has initiated a wonderful proposal. I have a picture of it here. It will certainly add to the island. It will give tourism a great boost up there. Christmas Island is only half an hour from Jakarta and, I think, only an hour from Singapore. Planes will fly from Western Australia into Christmas Island and then across to Singapore, bringing back a significant number of tourists, which will boost the Western Australian economy and open up a very significant tourist route from South East Asia. It is important for the Australian economy that our tourist industry is sustained and made grow. This development on Christmas Island will be another catalyst to promote the tourist industry predominantly in Western Australia. I hope that tourists will also come to my own State of Queensland. I hope they do, because they will always be welcome there. </PARA>
<PARA> The back of the brochure for the proposed Christmas Island casino outlines two unit developments offering cheaper backpacker-type accommodation to be opened up if the Christmas Island casino project goes ahead. We have received information that two other tourist ventures will start immediately if the Casino Control Ordinance is disallowed and the casino is allowed to be built on Christmas Island. Only the other day a book launch was held in Parliament House. I do not know whether Senator Jenkins was invited or whether she was too embarrassed to come. I did not see her there. </PARA>

I would have arranged an invitation for her because if she had been able to attend she would have been able to meet some expatriate Christmas Islanders. The book was launched by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). The 60 or 70 expatriate Christmas Islanders at the launch overwhelmingly said, as one voice, `The only thing that we have left is a casino. Please give it to us, and please give it to us as quickly as possible'. Senator Jenkins and the Australian Democrats have ignored their plea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Woodmore is going to spend $2m as part of the proposal to develop the airstrip on Christmas Island. At present the airstrip has a black star rating, which means that people are allowed to fly in only on charter aircraft. The expenditure of $2m to upgrade the airport will allow Christmas Islanders and people who wish to visit the island to fly in in relative safety. This is something that they are not able to do at the moment. That is another area that this proposal will straighten out-a decent airport for Christmas Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very difficult even to follow the argument of the Democrats. I am quite happy to support Senator Richardson. It is not with any great joy that we join hands across the chamber but I think that on occasions such as this we have to provide some future for the Islanders. I understand that the casino will employ 185 to 200 people. A great number of spin-off jobs will be created. One of the companies that are interested in mining on Christmas Island was very enthusiastic about the prospect of getting a decent airstrip which would allow it to fly in personnel and equipment. I was very happy to know that in a couple of weeks the green light would be given on this work. Other jobs will be created too. People will be needed to perform such jobs as mowing the airstrip. There will be additional jobs for people on the wharves. Fishermen will be needed to supply seafood to the patrons of the casino. There will be a great multiplier effect. In fact, I believe that with the casino and the restarting of the mine, albeit in a fairly limited way and only for an expected life span of five or six years, all unemployment will be mopped up on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a great number of Christmas Islanders who have come to Australia are now finding that they want to return to the island. They want to go back to the place where they were born, to their home, and that is only natural. I believe that all of us want to do that. I think we will find that many of those people will re-establish their homes on Christmas Island once they are able to get meaningful work on the island. I am sorry, on behalf of the coalition, that I cannot support the disallowance motion of Senator Jenkins and the Democrats. I am quite happy to say on behalf of the coalition that we will provide those jobs and job opportunities for all those Christmas Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I point out that Mr Woodmore is providing the $28m. Not a cent is coming from the Australian Government in the way of subsidy. Mr Woodmore has made a commercial decision to spend that money. Whether he wins or loses, it is a commercial venture, the success of which only the market and his expertise will determine. We on this side of the Senate applaud that venture. It will create jobs, and such ventures are what make the Australian economy go round. We wish him all the best in his venture, which we hope is successful, profitable and will provide a future for all Islanders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For at least a decade now various Federal Governments and Ministers, let alone Christmas Islanders themselves, have been pondering the future of Christmas Island. They have been trying to determine how best these people can live out their lives on the island of their choice. Of course, that is not easy when one sees the phosphate industry in decline and with obviously a very limited future. Given that that one single industry has provided the island with virtually all of its employment and its infrastructure, its decline means that an alternative must be sought. In seeking that alternative I do not believe that anyone has come up with a better idea than attempting to establish a viable tourist industry on Christmas Island. If we are to establish a viable tourist industry on Christmas Island, a resort-casino complex must be a central and integral part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that there has been mention of Frank Woodmore, the developer. I think we should go back and look at the poll that was conducted with respect to his proposed development. On 19 April 1986 the Christmas Island Assembly, an advisory body, conducted a poll of island residents. All persons over 18 years and resident for at least three months were entitled to vote. Voting was by secret ballot. Of the 1,298 eligible voters, 1,172 were present on the island on the day of the poll and 955 voted. The results of the poll were that 896 voted `Yes' and 49 `No', with 10 informal votes. That result indicates resounding support in every way. I do not know how many referendum proposals could ever attract that sort of support. Voting was not compulsory yet 81 per cent of those registered actually voted, and 93 per cent of that 81 per cent voted in favour. So obviously on the island itself, there is very strong support for this development. In the end, one wonders how clever governments are in telling people what is good for them. Occasionally, perhaps, one must give the people a say and listen to their comments. I think the Christmas Islanders have made it very clear to the Government that they overwhelmingly support the going ahead of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes back to the original draft proposal and the way that the Government acted thereafter, contrary to Senator Jenkins's claims the proposal was subjected to an environmental impact assessment. It went through the rigours of Commonwealth legislation. In December 1986 the Government agreed that the proposal could proceed, and on 4 June 1987 the Commonwealth signed an agreement with the developer and his guarantors setting out the formal terms and conditions upon which the development could proceed. That agreement was tabled in Parliament on 7 October last year. We are told by the honourable senator that the Australian Democrats are concerned about the effects on the fauna on the island if the proposal proceeds. The Government has demonstrated time and time again that it shares a concern for flora and fauna and the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmental impact assessment to which I just referred was conducted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The assessment included scrutiny by officers of both the then Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. That assessment concluded that, if a range of measures were put in place to protect the environment and in particular to protect the fauna on the island, the project could proceed. As a result of that, detailed environment protection measures were developed. The developer has agreed to implement those measures, and of course they were incorporated as formal requirements in the agreement of 4 June 1987. On the basis of the developer undertaking to protect the environment by fulfilling his obligations with these new protection measures, the then Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen, determined that the requirements of the Act had been met and that the project could go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has a conservator on the island full time. That person and the staff of the Service have been involved in every step of the development of this project. They will ensure that all these environment protection measures are met and fulfilled. Obviously Christmas Island is well known as the habitat and the breeding ground of a number of rare and endangered species. The Abbott's Booby bird is probably the most widely known of those species. We have recognised the particular importance of this area as a breeding ground for endangered species by declaring the Christmas Island National Park. It occupies 17 per cent of the land area of Christmas Island. However, I had discussions with my colleague the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding) only a fortnight ago and as a result of those discussions there will be major extensions to the Christmas Island National Park. It will shortly encompass about 70 per cent of the land area of the island. The national park as extended will include all of the areas on the island that were identified in 1985 by an independent consultant as being habitats of national and international importance. Also included will be all areas of high conservation value and areas of high landscape value. The site for the resort and casino will not be within the proposed extended park boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> For this development to take place and for a viable tourist industry to follow, obviously there will need to be significant improvements in the island's infrastructure. The agreement between the Commonwealth and the resort casino developer requires that a great many things be done, and I will mention a few. The developer must maintain, upgrade and operate the airport to an acceptable standard. He is required to provide his own water, his own sewerage works and his own electricity, all at his own cost. He must develop an international standard resort including the usual tourist facilities plus a casino and, importantly, he must pay a minimum of $1m a year as a licence fee or 10 per cent of the gross casino profit, whichever is greater. </PARA>
<PARA> The development is expected to employ between 200 and 300 people. It will create its own demand for tourist facilities, for shops, restaurants and other leisure activities, all of which will generate more employment. Potential developers have indicated that additional accommodation would be viable if the resort casino goes ahead. When one looks at the island one wonders just what else could be done to generate 200 or 300 new jobs. I do not know of any other proposal that could provide that sort of employment or a future for those islanders who wish to remain on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> A view has been expressed that the establishment of a casino in any community adds unacceptably to potential avenues for gambling. Legal casino-style gambling is already established on Christmas Island. It is part of the local community's culture. Obviously, the community does not believe that this new development will place any strain on its social or cultural values or system. Concerns has been expressed that casino gambling attracts organised crime. The Government obviously is mindful of those concerns. In addressing that issue, the arrangements for Government supervision of the Christmas Island casino are equal to, if not tougher than, any other jurisdiction in Australia, or for that matter in the world. One wonders what more the Government could be expected to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance has been drafted to include the most effective gaming controls implemented in other Australian jurisdictions. The Ordinance provides for a casino controller and inspectors to be appointed by the Minister to ensure the casino is operated in accordance with the Ordinance. In addition, the Ordinance creates an independent casino surveillance authority to advise the Minister on all aspects of the operation of the casino. These plans have been subjected to very close scrutiny by the Australian Federal Police, the Attorney-General's Department and other security organisations. The arrangements set out in the Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance have been agreed to by all those authorities. The legislation has been developed to the requirements of the participating law enforcement agencies and those agencies will, of course, monitor the enforcement and effectiveness of all those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Christmas Island community has indicated, by secret ballot, its overwhelming support for the proposal. There is no other possibility for employment growth and security on Christmas Island. If this disallowance motion were successful, we would only doom the people left on Christmas Island to having no future at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure of the Government's view on this matter but the Opposition's view is that the Bills should be debated cognately. It seems to me that it would be the most expeditious way of dealing with the matters. I am concerned about the proposed order of dealing with the Bills at the committee stage.

I feel that the proposal will unfortunately have that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that I understand the reason why the Democrats are seeking to do this. They believe that their Bills relate to particular matters that exist within the Government Bills. However, as one who tries to make life as simple as possible, I would have thought that the best course of action would be to dispose of the package of the four Government Bills and then to move on and deal with the Democrats' three Bills. During the course of the second reading debate, and no doubt during parts of the debate in committee on the Government Bills, it will become apparent whether or not the Democrats' committee amendments in their Bills are going to serve any purpose at all. Certainly, my suggestion is that a cognate debate take place but that in committee the Bills be dealt with in the order of the four Government Bills and then the three Australian Democrats Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a series of Bills relating to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), including four Government Bills that are intended to introduce a system of self-government into the ACT and obviously provide a framework in which it would operate. In addition, the Senate is now also debating three Australian Democrats' Bills that are also relevant to the subject of self-government and the structure under which it would operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that there is an element of history in all legislation that passes through this chamber, but that must be accentuated in the situation of legislation that establishes any new form of self-government in our country. That, as I have indicated, is the purpose of these Bills, and I think we are all conscious of that element of history. There has gone before a long process of development of legislation to this day, a process with which I have not had a close association for more than the past couple of months, but both within and without the chamber there are those in the ACT and politicians in this Parliament who have been closely associated with this process of development towards self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> As to my position in this matter, I would like to put on record that the negotiating process has, in my view, been simplified, in part because the Opposition parties, the Liberal and National parties, together with the Government and the Australian Democrats, have approached this development, at least in recent times, on the basis that we want to achieve self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. With that common objective, the challenge has therefore been simply to find a form in which that can operate and which has the approval certainly of the major parties and, hopefully, of all parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, at this stage I want to put on record my appreciation for the way in which the office of Minister for the Arts and Territories, as well as the Minister's staff and officials of the ACT Administration, have negotiated with me. It has been a positive and constructive process of development. Also, I must say that in my dealings Senator Jenkins and the Australian Democrats have also been positive and constructive. This makes what could be an enormously complex task considerably easier. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the history to which I referred a moment ago, I also want to pay a tribute to my predecessor in this position as Opposition spokesman on the ACT, Senator Amanda Vanstone, whose mark is also on this legislative package. I also pay tribute to my colleague Senator Margaret Reid, who has been associated over many years with the development of what we will regard as a good system of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. On our side, we regard Senator Reid as our local member for the ACT and have to lean upon her extensively. In our view, she plays a very significant role within our parties and in this Parliament to the benefit of the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> We have advocated self-government for the Australian Capital Territory for a number of reasons. The first is that it will allow direct democratic input into the functions of government that effect the everyday lives of citizens of the Territory-whether they be in health, education, transport, or any of the other areas of government that are so relevant to the lifestyle of individuals. Unfortunately, to date, the citizens of the ACT have not had that direct input in the way that is open to citizens of the States of Australia and also, of recent years, to citizens of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the result has been some frustration. All of us who live in Canberra or who come to Canberra every week know of criticisms of a number of aspects of the provision of government services in the Territory. As I have just indicated, there has not been the same potential for the community to act in a democratic way to resolve these problems as applies in the States of Australia. Following self-government, that opportunity will be open to the citizens of the ACT. If citizens are unhappy with the health service, they will have their own representatives in their own self-governing body to whom they can make representations, apply pressure and, hopefully, produce the results that they are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we are supporting self-government because it seems obvious to us, and I think it should be obvious to anybody, that we are entering a time of much greater financial constraint within the ACT. The Commonwealth Grants Commission, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, has recently put down reports that deal with the ACT. The 1986-87 figures would appear to indicate that after the Commonwealth paying for normal Commonwealth functions and for the operation of this Parliament, and on top of local taxes, there is a shortfall figure, which at the moment is made up by the Commonwealth, of approximately $80m. We have received representations from concerned individuals in the ACT that there are deficiencies in those assessments. The Grants Commission certainly acknowledges that there are shortcomings in those figures relative to a lack of certain basic information. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point I want to make is that up till now there has been no independent body that can argue the case on behalf of the ACT community in that regard, either as to why the Grants Commission might be in error in making those assessments or as to why perhaps the Commonwealth on those figures may not be meeting its full responsibility. It seems to me that as we move into this period of greater financial constraint, an independent body on behalf of the ACT that can properly represent the citizens of the Territory in negotiations with the Commonwealth, in the same way as each of the State governments can do in relation to their citizens, is going to be critically important for the people of the Territory. That is the second reason why I think self-government is going to be vitally important for the Territory in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason, I have to say with some regret, is that unfortunately there is a neglect in deliberations and concerns on local matters that affect the ACT within this Parliament. I guess that is not surprising because most of us come here with particular interests in national and Commonwealth matters. But it is absolutely clear that local, domestic concerns do not receive anything like the same level of attention and treatment that they receive in the States or in the Northern Territory. As I indicated when I paid tribute to Senator Reid a moment ago-and I look across the chamber and see Senator McMullan-an enormous weight is therefore placed upon the very few representatives of the ACT in this Parliament and, of course, they can do only so much. Those local issues that I have mentioned-health, education, transport, et cetera-tend not to be debated in this Parliament, but if they do get debated, the debates-are superficial by nature of the other preoccupations of this place. It therefore seems to me that better service through proper accountability and direct representation must follow from self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to admit that I was staggered when I learnt a couple of months ago that there is a staff of some 17,000 in the ACT Administration. That struck me as a very large bureaucracy and clearly it is a bureaucracy that has been neglected by this Parliament. Under a self-governing body, directly concerned with the provision of its own services, there will be much greater accountability in that regard. That will be good for the staff members who will no doubt feel that their contributions are being better acknowledged and rewarded, and it will be better for the local community, through the principles of accountability in democratic government. With a staff of 17,000 and a budget of over $1 billion, we are actually looking at large numbers of people and a large amount of money. That is the third reason why we on this side of the chamber came to the firm view that the time for self-government had come. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that a great deal of work has been done in the last few years to facilitate the process of self-government in the ACT. The consolidation of functions into one administration and into one budget has made it much easier for us to properly appreciate what will be transferred from the Commonwealth to the new State administration. I acknowledge the work that has been done in that regard. For our benefit and for the benefit of the people of the ACT the whole picture is much clearer than it perhaps was a few years ago. So in many ways these Bills today are the culmination of many years of work by many people, whether they are in the administration, in the political process or in the political parties. I guess that is all part of the history of today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA> What I propose to do, relatively briefly, is to run through the more significant pro- visions of the four Government Bills, and particularly those that have been the subject of debate and those that are are being amended as a result of matters that we have pressed upon the Government. I am pleased to be able to say that most matters that we have pressed upon the Government, it has now accepted either fully or in a compromised form. So we will in fact be able to support all of the Government's amendments. There will be only a couple of extra amendments that we will seek, but many of those Government amendments that we will be supporting in fact are as a result of long discussions that have taken place between the parties and compromises which we believe will be in the best interests of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the Bills, the critical one, is the Australian Capital Territory (Self- Government) Bill, which will establish a Legislative Assembly of 17 members. The number has been the subject of argument. We think it is an appropriate size for the ACT. If it were much smaller we would not get a fair representation of different views. If it were much larger it would, at this stage, look like overgovernment. There is no perfect number and it therefore seems to us to be a reasonable compromise. Similarly, an Executive of four Ministers seems to us to be an appropriate number to adequately conduct the responsibility of the Executive for the ACT. The Chief Minister will be elected by the Assembly. The indication from that is that we ultimately decided against pressing what we thought at one stage might be the best course, and that was to have a Chief Minister elected at large. We determined in the end that it would be better if the Chief Minister was elected from those who are in turn elected directly by the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assembly may be dissolved by the Governor-General in certain circumstances. I guess this was the first of the controversial issues, because it gave the Governor-General power to dissolve the Assembly if he determines or, in other words, if the Government of the Commonwealth determines, that `the Assembly is incapable of effectively performing its functions, or is conducting its affairs in a grossly improper manner'. Some within the ACT regard that as somewhat paternalistic. We determined in the end, and our approach has been consistently cautious, that that safeguard should be retained, at least for the time being. It might be that, after a period of satisfactory operation of the new form of self-government, we on this side of the chamber would look to deleting such safeguards which certainly do not exist in relation to a State. But we have adopted a step by step approach and therefore we have accepted that that safeguard be continued for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General also retains a power to make ordinances. We were concerned about that. It seemed too simple a process for the Executive of this Government to make ordinances that overrode the local Assembly's enactments. We therefore negotiated with the Government and the Government has agreed that the ordinance making power of the Commonwealth will be limited to its national functions and will not apply in relation to Territory functions. We think that that is a satisfactory compromise with regard to the second of those controversial issues. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a fixed term of government. We have supported a fixed term in this instance, although some might say that is moving away from the position we have adopted in the past. However, we believed in the unique circumstances of this body, with its local connotations which, in some ways, make it similar to local government elsewhere-of course, it is a blend of what we might see elsewhere as a local government or State government-that a fixed term is the most appropriate. However, we argued-I think this comes under the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill-that the term of government should be reduced from four years to three; that if we were to have a fixed term three years was a satisfactory period. The Government has agreed to that. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned, as were many people within the Territory, by the provisions that dealt with a new form of bureaucrat, to be titled the Head of Administration, who seemed to have functions and capacities that went beyond the normal Westminster system of accountability between a Minister and a head of department. I am pleased to say that as a result of that the Government has agreed to amendments that will restrict the functions of that person, basically either to those given by the new Legislative Assembly or in accordance with the operation of the public service of the new Assembly. We regard that as a satisfactory resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The last amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill, which we will be pressing, which the Government does not concede, not because it does not accept the amendment's merits but because it believes that the matter is adequately covered elsewhere in law, concerns the excluding of this Parliament from local domestic laws passed by the Territory Assembly because of the unusual circumstances in which we operate-our unusual hours and, perhaps, the unusual obligations that we place on staff of this place, which might well run counter to domestic industrial laws, for example. It obviously remains a major responsibility of ours to ensure the proper functioning of this Parliament. We will be moving an amendment to ensure that there is no ambiguity in that regard. As I said, I understand that the Government accepts the principle of what we state; it simply believes that it is adequately covered elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988, sets up the electoral system. I guess this Bill has been the subject of most debate within the ACT community. We have accepted in the end, after a long period of debate, that there should simply be one electorate for the ACT. I indicated earlier that we are looking at a unique city State environment-unique in terms of Australia, although not unique worldwide. The objective was to find an electoral system that particularly suited those unique circumstances, and in the end we accepted that there should be one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have since had a long public debate about the most appropriate electoral system within that one electorate-whether we should pursue a Senate-type system, some other proportional representation (PR) system or whether we should move to something that is unique. In the end we were persuaded to accept a form of the d'Hondt electoral system-a popular European system for houses of government. Our concerns with the PR system are that it is a house of government that will be elected. The Assembly will have only a small number of elected representatives-17 in all. Our concern was that either a direct Senate-type system or a PR system would have the effect that the Government could be controlled by one or two elected representatives representing single interest groups or particular interests of the day. We did not think such a system would have the best chance of leading to stable government. In this exercise we are seeking for ACT self-government not only democracy but also stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The d'Hondt system is a proven system for houses of government. Obviously I do not have time to go through the structure, but I concede that it has been principally developed as a party-type system. Not surprisingly, there are those on our side of the chamber who, as we tend to be made up of individualists, have said that for us to support such a system there must be modifications to allow an adequate expression of the preference of individuals. That has now been accommodated in three ways, through a long series of negotiations and compromises, in a form that we now regard as satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The first compromise is that whereas under the d'Hondt system small interest groups normally are excluded unless they achieve the `drop quota', those who vote for such small groups will now have their second preferences consolidated with the major parties or major independents so that their votes will not be lost. That is the first compromise, in accordance with our political psychology, that we think is wise. I understand that in Europe those votes are simply excluded and that further preferences do not come into the count. In this instance they will. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government has been prepared to agree to preferences being expressed and counted within parties. I think that this system has been adopted within only one of the European states. Certainly, it is unusual in the European context. Of course, it makes us much more comfortable. I note that none of my Tasmanian colleagues are in the chamber at the moment but Tasmanians, for example, sometimes do not much like following the party line. They will vote for candidates within a party but will want to establish their own order. We want the same flexibility within this system, and now there will be. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third and last modification the Government has accepted, there can now be one expression of preference for individuals across party lines. That expression of preference for an individual will take precedence over an indication of a party vote. We think that that adequately allows for the individuality of the voter, who can express a particular voting objective within the d'Hondt system. We think that ultimately we have produced a form of the system, much compromised to meet the Australian political background, psychology and culture, that will be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that there is to be a fixed term of government and that we are supporting that. However, we are not supporting the Government's intention that the first election be publicly funded. That is consistent with positions we have taken in the past. However, if the Australian Democrats are consistent with their previous positions, we are likely to lose that matter. Nevertheless, we believe that the public purse should not be used in that way. Of course, after the first election the Territory itself will determine its own practices in that regard and will be accountable to its own voters for the costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The third of the Bills is the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill 1988, a critically important Bill which will divide the National Capital Development Commission into two bodies, one dealing with national capital planning matters and headed by a National Capital Planning Authority which will establish a national plan, and the second a Territory Planning Authority which will deal with Territory planning matters. I do not have time to deal with the structure of that Bill in any detail. However, I will say that in our view it maintains extensive powers in the Commonwealth. Some feel that a little too much power is retained to the Commonwealth function. Nevertheless, as I said, this is a cautious approach and, looking at our primary responsibilities in relation to the national capital aspect of the ACT and our national responsibility in that regard, we on this side of the chamber have endorsed that approach. I will deal with some matters in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill at the committee stage. The ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill deals with incidental matters and I do not have time to consider them at this moment. The Opposition is pleased to be able to support the second reading of the Bills. We look forward to the committee stage of the debate. We are confident that at the end of the committee stage we will be able to support the third reading of the Bills and, therefore, the ACT will achieve self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the electoral system and the question of financial relations with the Commonwealth, the other major area of debate has been the transfer of appropriate functions. It was intended by the Government that a number of functions which one would normally believe were appropriate to self-government not be transferred; for instance policing functions, criminal law, legal practitioners and the courts. It has been very difficult to determine a sound reason for that failure to transfer, but as a result of negotiations the Government is now prepared, as of a date in 1990, to agree to have all of those functions, except the courts, transferred. It would like the courts question to remain open for further consideration. Short of any valid argument that the Government is able to put up for that exclusion we would still seek the transferal of the courts, but we would accept the date of 1990 which applies to the other functions. So if we were talking about making proper arrangements with judges for their tenure or other Commonwealth responsibilities, that would allow more than adequate time to address those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the unique circumstances of the ACT and the efforts that have had to be made to meet those unique circumstances. They are unique not only because of our constitutional responsibility for the national capital but also because of the geographical nature of a city State within Australia. I therefore confirm our support for the package as a whole and our hope that self-government in the ACT will be productive, useful and efficient. Certainly we intend to monitor closely the operation of these proposed laws. As I have indicated, we will be flexible in the future and will look at further adaptations of them to suit a maturing self-government environment. We are not bound in any way. We see this as one critical step within an ongoing process. On behalf of the Opposition, I wish self-government in the ACT a long and useful future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately seven Bills which will enable a suitable framework to be put into place for self-government for the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The Government's Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill and the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill were introduced into the House of Representatives on 19 October-just a month ago. The Government's fourth Bill-the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill-was introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 November. The Australian Capital Territory (Open Government, Probity and Citizens' Rights) Bill, the Australian Capital Territory (Protection of the National Interest) Bill and the Australian Capital Territory (Establishment and Amendment of New Constitution) Bill were introduced into the Senate by me, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, on 8 November-just two weeks ago. Just a short while ago I heard that the Government intends to introduce a revised explanatory memorandum, which will be available to honourable senators tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Going through the history of this legislation, I found myself in the fortunate position of being assigned the Australian Democrats' Territories portfolio when I first became a member of this place some 15 or 16 months ago. At that time the words `self-government' were on everybody's lips. Self-government and self-management were obviously needed by the people here. That was demonstrated to me very early on by a number of ACT residents, in steady succession, beating a path to my door. Without exception, the issues they raised were local ones that should have been addressed by their locally elected representatives who were directly responsible to them. However, the matters that concerned those ACT residents were being decided by Federal Parliament legislation, which at least is democratic and open; by ordinance or regulation, which is not so democratic and not so open; or by a stroke of the current Minister's pen on the advice of the ACT bureaucracy. That last method of making changes is the most objectionable and the least democratic. </PARA>
<PARA> During the time that I have been involved in this portfolio, on behalf of the Democrats, not one of the three Ministers or the two Opposition shadow Ministers, or I, have been directly voted into this Parliament by the people of the ACT, although I am sure that we have all done our best in the areas with which we have been concerned. At last self-government is about to come to fruition. It is unfortunate that not all the people of the ACT feel that it should. According to the result of a poll which was published in last Sunday's Canberra Times, a fair proportion of people still feel that they do not need it or want it. However, it may well be that the question put by the Canberra Times should have been framed somewhat differently. Perhaps people should have been asked whether they want the responsibility of self-government, self-management or self-determination. If we look back we see that people have given their lives for such rights. The suffragettes fought for it. When the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission is set up, the Aboriginal people will have their first direct taste of it. I might add that a Senate-style electoral system is regarded by the Government as being suitable for our Aboriginal population when its own commission is set up. </PARA>
<PARA> I give the Government credit for the degree to which it has moved from the mean and grudging half-hearted self-government offer which was first put forward in 1986. In particular, credit must be given to the Government for agreeing to accept that the ACT must be a body politic. That is a major development. It represents recognition that the ACT is a significant and self-contained community, in addition to its other concurrent characteristics. The Government has also agreed that the electoral system for the ACT should be based on proportional representation. With severely muted enthusiasm, I applaud it for that decision. My enthusiasm is muted because the Government has identified and has proposed the only obnoxious form of proportional representation that I have ever heard of. In fact, we all rushed off to the textbooks when the word `d'Hondt' was first brought up. The d'Hondt system has now been consolidated and modified, but I can assure the Senate that the electoral reform societies all over Australia continue to tear out their hair about it. We are surprised that such a system has been brought in. I wish to quote from the Australian Labor Party's Platform Resolutions and Rules of 1988. Resolution No. 32 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor supports the adoption of a system of optional preferential voting for all elections with all votes remaining valid while the voter's intention is clear. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the d'Hondt system has been modified and adapted, it is still not a system where all votes remain valid while the voter's intention is clear. That is simply not so in that system, although a number of amendments will be moved during the committee stage which I hope will rectify that. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter on which some progress has been made relates to the arrangements for the ACT to be treated fairly in financial matters. The Australian Democrats welcome the fact that it is acknowledged to be appropriate for this need to be recognised in legislation and regret the Government's apparent unwillingness to address the matter more comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter for which the Government deserves credit is its recognition of the commonsense of presenting the self-government proposals as a package of separate and self-contained but related Bills. This will greatly facilitate the debate, especially during the committee stage. Even more importantly, it will lead to legislation which I believe will be user-friendly and comprehensible to the person in the street. I must state that I am disappointed that my recommendation for the order of debate of the Bills in the committee stage was not accepted by the Senate. I believe that that would have helped the debate to be completed in a more efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like at this point to join Senator Hill in saying that the negotiations which I have had with Ministers and shadow Ministers on this matter during the last 15 or 16 months have for the most part been cordial, although it was apparent to me that I was working from a different ideological base. I had some surprises there; I was surprised to find how close the Government and the Opposition were in certain matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all these things and having given the Government credit for the respects in which it has advanced its position to the benefit of the people of the ACT, I must record a fundamental concern about the processes which have been followed. I must also record a deep-seated sense of unease about what I refer to as the flavour of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament should squarely acknowledge major defects in the processes by which this legislation has been prepared. I believe that we should acknowledge these defects for two reasons: first, in a curious mirror-image sort of a way, it highlights or exemplifies one of the major reasons why ACT self-government is so important and so needed; and, second, it emphasises the heavy responsibility which we carry in this place to check through the Bills with care, paying attention to the detail as well as to the self-evidently important elements. </PARA>
<PARA> The defect to which I refer and to which Senator Hill has already referred is the total absence of local citizen input into this legislation. We do not have the elected representatives of the people of the ACT able to be the main players in this because the former ACT Assembly was allowed to lapse a couple of years ago, which has meant that locally there has not been any group of aware and elected citizens, with support staff and an acknowledged mandate from their fellow citizens, to negotiate the detailed arrangements for self-government on behalf of ACT residents. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the superb job done by Rosemary Nairn and her team in the ACT Self-Government Campaign Committee. Many honourable senators here will gratefully acknowledge the quality of the representations they made, but their actions were just that-representations made from outside the processes. They were not inputs made within these processes. My concern is that this major and wholly unfortunate defect in the process may be connected with another apparent element which causes me to have a sense of unease. There is something about this whole package of legislation which seems to me to denote a Public Service derived package of Bills, rather than a government package or elected parliamentary representative package. </PARA>
<PARA> As I will indicate later, there are ways in which these Bills are severely defective. I and the Australian Democrats have struggled hard with the task of identifying how these defects could be said to fit in with any elements or tenets of Australian Labor Party policy or with the policy of any major ALP factions. I have already read out one relevant ALP resolution. I have been unsuccessful in identifying any way in which the defects in these Bills-other than those related to the electoral system-benefit the ALP as a party or as a government. I have therefore formed the conclusion-and I hope I am not being unduly charitable here-that there are provisions in the Bills inserted by the ACT Administration in the interests of that Administration, or in the interests of that monolith which we in this place sometimes refer to as `the bureaucracy'. </PARA>
<PARA> The unusual earlier proposed arrangement for a super-bureaucrat is a case in point. This has already been modified somewhat by the Government since it was drawn to its attention by various groups. Another case in point is the extent to which the executive arm of government, which of course acts on the advice of the bureaucracy, has opportunities to intervene in and to overturn decisions made by the ACT legislature, although this too has been modified by the Government following representations. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns and apprehensions which I have pointed out lead to a major point which I want to make about the context in which we are operating. The very broad outlines of the Government's proposals have been known for many months, but the substance of the proposals has been known for only a short time. Considering their complexity, the amount of new material not contained in the discussion papers, and the fact that amendments were coming in very late on Monday evening, I think this may lead us to some complexities during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The detailed arrangements for planning in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill and the 41 pages of intricate but vital proposals in the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which came in later than the others, are of great importance to this Parliamant and to the people of the ACT. At one stage it appeared that we might be expected to handle these complex issues with a very short lead-up time. As I said before, these issues are very complex and very important to the people of the ACT and they deserve to be dealt with properly and cautiously. Indeed, all of us here are expected during the committee stage to analyse the various amendments with great care and, at the end of it all, to come out with a total package of correct legislation. I hope that that will be the case. Although, as I said before, we have great complexities and a great number of amendments before us, I hope that they all can be dealt with properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Our discussions relating to all seven Bills before us will be facilitated, I believe, if we first identify the principles that should apply to these Bills. We should then, in my view, carefully check each Bill to discover to what extent it is consistent with those principles. I wish to propose several principles which the Senate might require the Bills to comply with: The principle that the electoral system applied should ensure to ACT residents a right to fairness in the electoral process no less than that right enjoyed in other parts of Australia; the principle that the ACT should have the maximum degree of autonomy that is consistent with the national and regional interest; the principle that in the case of the Australian Capital Territory, as with other jurisdictions, the general principle should be that there may not be interference with a legislature by an executive, and particularly not by the executive of another level of government-I am referring here, of course, to the Federal Government; the principle to protect the prerogatives of the national Parliament in relation to the national capital; the principle that the legislation must ensure proper financial protection for the ACT, protection which acknowledges the general processes of the Grants Commission and, in particular, areas during the transitional stages, which I know are of concern to some people; the principle that there must be statutory guarantees of proper consultation between the national and territorial planning authorities, and processes for negotiated outcomes, wherever possible, in the case of conflict; the principle that the ACT legislature should have the right to determine, not merely to advise on, the form of executive government and administration the Territory should have; the principle that open government, probity and civil rights must be guaranteed in the national capital; and the principle that the people of the ACT, through their legislature, must have an opportunity to establish a Constitution of their own choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The general character of the amendments that I will be moving to the Government's Bills will be to ensure that the principles I have mentioned are more adequately reflected in the legislation finally adopted. Where it is necessary to do so I will also be seeking Senate endorsement for my supplementary and complementary Bills which I believe represent a sensible way of attending to some of the errors in and omissions from the Government's Bills. I will also be supporting some of the amendments to be moved by Senator Hill. I would here like to acknowledge the roles that he and Senator Reid have played in identifying improvements to the Bills before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the support for the Opposition's contribution in other respects, the first matter that I wish to address at this point is one on which an unholy alliance seems to have developed between the Government and the Opposition, and I refer to the question of the electoral system. The Government seeks to make much of the degree of flexibility it has shown, but unfortunately its credibility in this area is akin to that of a slave trader who claims credit for having reduced his annual trade from 10,000 brutalised victims to a mere 3,000. This is the form of flexibility that I believe the Government has shown on the electoral system. I draw the attention of honourable senators to one key deficiency in the present proposals-the way candidates not achieving a quota are all excluded at one time. Senator Hill has applauded that. I simply cannot do that. I would, in support, like to read from an article by Geoffrey Goode, who is President of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia, in yesterday's Canberra Times. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The ``consolidated d'Hondt'' system being foisted on the ACT discriminates blatantly against independent candidates or small parties by excluding them from the count if they do not reach a quota as first preferences, ie they are not allowed to interchange preferences to build up a quota for one of them, but their votes are arbitrarily directed to one of their much lower preferences. Just as outrageous is the proposal that surplus votes received by an independent or a party are to be disregarded. All this legislatively-prescribed disregarding of votes can readily enable a minority of actual votes to become a ``majority'' of ``approved'' votes, ie those votes not disregarded. Such a ``majority'' then elects a real majority of Assembly members. </PARA>
<PARA> If the proven successes of the Tasmanian system are to be ignored, the very least the Senate can do for ACT democracy is to amend the ACT Electoral Bill to require the use of Senate-style quota-preferential voting, which does allow full and free transfer of each voter's preferences, but to forego that system's accreted restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be moving an amendment which will cope in part with that, whatever is the final electoral system decided by this place. At this stage, in relation to the motion that the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill be now read a second time, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after `That', insert, `consideration of the Second Reading of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988 be an Order of the Day for 2 sitting days after today to enable the Government to prepare amendments to provide for the operation, in the ACT, of the `Robson Amendment' form of printing and distributing ballot papers as used in Tasmania, being provision which, to the maximum extent possible, will have application regardless of the particular method adopted for the marking and counting of ballot papers'. </PARA>
<PARA>In that way, whichever is the final electoral system which is decided by this place, at least if we are landed with a party vote system the names of the candidates can then be rotated on the ballot papers so people have the chance to vote for the candidate of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which I wish to address is the difficulty that the Government-or is it the bureaucracy?-has had in granting the new legislature immunity from interference by the executive arm of government. Proposals are contained in the Bills for the Federal executive to have the right to dismiss the ACT legislature, to disallow ACT enactments, and to override ACT laws by continued use of the ordinance-making process. Who would prepare, I ask the Senate, the material considered in these regards by the Federal Executive Council and the Governor-General; material, by the way, which is not to be made public and which is not subject to corrections of errors, bias or selectivity? Of course, that material would be prepared by the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have often enough seen situations in which we must stand up for the rights of legislatures, for the rights of those who are electorally accountable for their dealings with bureaucracies. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I shall therefore be moving amendments to protect the rights of communities which vote to have matters determined by the people they vote for. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter to be addressed is the extent and nature of the powers the ACT legislature should have. This raises questions such as the range of matters on which the legislature should have powers to act. I will be addressing these matters and moving amendments during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> More important is the question of the right of the legislature to determine and to change the form of the executive government and the form of administration which it wishes to have. The present Government Bills are wrong-headed, in my view, in considering it appropriate for this Parliament to specify detailed arrangements in these regards and again I shall be moving amendments. Interim arrangements can fairly be put in place, but to specify that these arrangements cannot be changed without the approval of the national government, even with respect to whether the number of territorial Ministers should be three, four or five, is in my view to inflict an inappropriate, nitpicking form of interference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made what I consider a real dog's dinner of the planning arrangements. The present National Capital Development Commission should have continued for another 12 months or so, because at the very time when the work load for the new ACT legislature will be the greatest it will have to sort out as a matter of urgency details of the new planning system. We are refusing it the opportunity to develop and adjust the existing arrangements and to take part in negotiating more far-reaching arrangements at a sensibly dated later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, even at this point we do not know what is to be in the complementary Interim Territory Planning Ordinance referred to in clause 58 of the Planning and Land Management Bill. Maybe in the committee stage we can learn something of that. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons that I have outlined, we must ensure that ACT self-government is achieved without delay, but it must be achieved within the right framework for the people of the ACT. I think all of us in this place must rise to that challenge. As I said, I believe we will be very busy during the committee stage. I believe the Minister at that stage will be Senator Richardson. He will have the advisers there, some of whose faces I know so well. We will also have Senator Hill for the Opposition and I have the fullest confidence in him, expecially after he was described by the shadow Minister in the other place as `Senator Hill, the shadow Minister for the Australian Capital Territory, with a bottomless pit of knowledge on this subject'. No doubt we will manage the committee stage quite adequately because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The self-government of the ACT involves the putting into place of the last remaining segment of the overall constitutional arrangements of our nation. This is the first of the major reasons for the ACT self-government being important. We are at long last moving to complete a process that was commenced nearly 100 years ago. The constitutional arrangements to be applied to the national capital of that then new nation are now, it seems, at last to be put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that in the ACT there is a large population to be reprieved from feudalism-a population two-thirds the size of that of Tasmania; a population living without basic human rights in a curious form of medieval fiefdom. This is the second reason why ACT self-government is so important. Without self-government, at least 300,000 Australians will continue to live in an autocracy, denied the right to self-management as a community, a right taken for granted in all other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, as well, the challenge of the complexities to be balanced as the ACT takes up its democratic inheritance. The ACT is three things in one: it is a major self-contained discrete State-type community in its own right; it is the centre of a coherent wider region, suppling major services to that region and providing major facilities used by that region; and it is the national capital. Balancing these three characteristics in a coherent package of self-government proposals is a task worthy of the close attention of the Senate. That is the third reason why ACT self-government is so important. It involves the making of judgments and the achieving of balances which deserve and need the scrutiny of all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I wish the ACT well in its quest for the correct framework for self-government and for the setting up of that self-government in its early stages and its first election next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of seven Bills, four Government Bills outlining the arrangements for Australian Capital Territory (ACT) self-government as proposed by the Australian Labor Party and the Government and, cognately, three Bills proposed by the Australian Democrats. I should say at the outset that obviously I will be supporting the four Government Bills and opposing the three Bills proposed by the Australian Democrats. Before I deal with them in detail I should like to comment on the somewhat paradoxical situation in which I find myself, and in which I think Senator Reid also finds herself. We are in a sense dealing with a matter of national significance. As Senator Jenkins said, it is the last stage in the democratic transition extending to all parts of Australia, with the exception of a few very minor territories, the rights of self-determination and accountability that are inherent in our otherwise democratic Constitution. For that reason it is an important national step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very historic change for the ACT, for my constituents, and a matter of great importance to me as a citizen here and as a representative of this Territory. So, in one sense, we have before the Senate a matter of very great interest and importance to it. However, I have to say to my colleagues, other than Senator Reid, that in a very profound sense we also have a situation which is none of their business. With one significant exception which relates to the planning elements, where there is a profound national interest, all the other matters really have nothing to do with the rest of my colleagues. Most of them have reflected that in the marked lack of interest that they have shown in the matter, about which I am not the slightest bit critical. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in noting that paradox, it is important to note that one of the reasons I am supporting the legislation is that it will lead to a situation in which legislation of importance to the ACT is dealt with by people whose business it properly is. It will also be important for the Senate. It will liberate the Senate from some of the lengthy debates, such as that recently on the casino, on issues which are also none of its business. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I have to say that it will make a significant difference to the capacity of that Committee to deal with all the other important pieces of delegated legislation which come before it because it will not have to deal with the welter of ACT ordinances. For example, both the House of Representatives and the Senate Standing Committees on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure will no longer after 12 months have to deliberate on minor questions of changes to road alignments here in the ACT. Those matters will be properly dealt with by the responsible representatives of the government of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is important nationally and for the Senate, but it is predominantly about the Australian Capital Territory. The legislation before us brings to the citizens of this city and the Territory those things which the rest of Australians take for granted. It gives to us in democratic terms equality with the rest of Australia. It allows our elected representatives to deliberate on the matters of health, education, transport and planning which are so important and affect the day to day lives of all citizens. Of course, it will give them equality in another sense which is important to me and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, and to Senator Reid. It will make the ACT's Federal representatives freer to participate as full members of the Federal Parliament without the constraints of also being shire councillors and State members of parliament. I do not say that by way of complaint because in my brief experience as a member of this place for the last nine months I have enjoyed the opportunity to be involved in a wide number of local issues. It has enhanced my capacity to participate effectively in national matters, but it must have been a substantial burden on ACT members who have represented it longer than I have, and I am sure they will welcome the opportunity to operate at the national level on an equal footing with their colleagues. But I warn the soon-to-be elected local representatives that I certainly and, I am sure, my colleagues, will not be losing the interest in and the desire to be involved in the local issues that affect the future of this city and this Territory. I will be particularly concerned to pursue my continuing interest and involvement in those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra has become a territory of more than 260,000 people. Its economic base is changing. It is no longer simply a government town. It is emerging as a growing diverse territory with the strengths and benefits of a growing healthy economy, but with the social and economic problems of any State or Territory. It is very difficult for colleagues who fly into Canberra on Monday or Tuesday and fly home on Thursday or Friday to the electorate in which they live, to which they are responsible and which they represent, to understand or even to know of the existence of the profound social problems that occur in this city in exactly the same way as elsewhere in Australia. Therefore, it is appropriate that these matters should become, as a result of this package of legislation, the responsibility of those whose job it is to advocate the interests of the people of the ACT and who are accountable to those people. As a matter of broad democratic principle it is unarguable, and I welcome the support, from honourable senators of all parties as far as I can tell, on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that we will not have unanimity on all the matters before us, but I join with Senator Hill and Senator Jenkins in saying that in the main the negotiations have been carried out in a very positive and constructive manner. I welcome the fact that all the parties have had a commitment in principle to the question of ACT self-government, even though in my view some of them have not been prepared to make the sorts of compromises always necessitated in the negotiations in which we have been involved if they are to be amicably resolved. We have achieved an agreement that will, if my expectations are fulfilled, lead to a very profound transfer of power within our country-a transfer from this Parliament to a democratically elected territorial assembly, with proper recognition of the democratic rights and responsibilities of the ACT. I will come back to that question of responsibilities in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill the very broad and proper responsibilities, defined as peace, order and good government of the Territory, will be the responsibility of the people of the ACT. I welcome also the fact that the recently published opinion poll in the Canberra Times indicated a very substantial change of opinions in the ACT since the referendum in 1978 towards the issue of self-government. It reflects the views that I have received from community members not that there is continuing apprehension about self-government-it is understandable that there would be with a major change-but that the community has changed its attitude profoundly since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the view that, despite the outcome of that opinion poll, this is not an appropriate matter for a referendum. In my view democracy is not optional. We do not have a choice to say that we want someone else to take care of our interests. In a democracy one has very profound rights but one also has an obligation to discharge one's responsibility to look after one's own interests. It is entirely appropriate that all the parties here support our proceeding with this matter by direct legislative means rather than by referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978 there have been very profound changes to the financial arrangements in the ACT. In the last two or three years the financial arrangements necessary for transition to self-government have already been established. I congratulate those involved in initiating those steps and in implementing those measures. So there is no reason why this should be a financial burden on the citizens of the ACT-on any individual or on them collectively. It will certainly not create a situation in which, unlike in the rest of Australia, the people of the ACT are overgoverned. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the ACT has only four elected representatives. As a result of this legislation we will have 21 elected representatives for 260,000 people. Any simple scrutiny of the circumstances in any of the States in terms of the number of elected representatives in State upper and lower Houses, Federal upper and lower Houses and local government shows that the proportion of representatives in the ACT compared with that in the States and the Northern Territory is still going to be very low. I think that this arrangement is quite appropriate. I think it would be more appropriate if the States and the Northern Territory considered following the ACT model rather than the ACT going any further towards following what they do. I hope that when the election occurs-it should be held as early as possible, in February or March of next year, so that the hiatus period between the passage of this legislation and the holding of new elections is as short as possible-the appropriate democratic arrangements will be in place and that we will not be faced with the problems of overgovernment or extra cost which caused some understandable concern in 1978 to the citizens of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal briefly with the more detailed Bills-the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill 1988. I do not think that these Bills, which are part of the package, have yet received sufficient consideration. I support the electoral Bill, which now incorporates the final version of the consolidated d'Hondt system of voting. I say without any equivocation that the d'Hondt system is not my first choice. It is certainly not the first choice of my Party as an electoral system. I find it unbelievable to the point of being absurd that anybody should put forward the argument-as some people have purported to do recently in newspapers and, unfortunately, in the debate here-that in some way it is a system designed to serve the interests of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now put forward six systems, all of which are quite different and all of which, when analysed, produce a result that in my view is inherently democratic-that is, that the party that gets the most votes wins the election, which is more than can be said for the electoral systems in some parts of this country. At some stage everyone has seen that one of these systems has not been in someone's interests. In 1986 the level of opposition to any of the proposed reforms was so profound that no progress towards self-government could effectively be made at all. In the immortal words of Ian Warden, self-government was butchered. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an electoral system that can work and that can achieve a fair balance between the desire to present a range of options to the people of the ACT, to have a result that reflects the wishes of the voters when they turn out at the polls and to provide a reasonable chance for stable government. I understand the wishes of the people of the ACT, as reflected in the most recent opinion poll, in which they say they would like to have their territorial government elected by the House of Representatives system, by the system that is established in every mainland State, under which representatives in their local areas will be elected by them under the optional preferential or preferential voting system. I understand that; I think they are absolutely right. I think that system must ultimately come to the ACT because it reflects the best principles of the Westminster system. But I accept that a majority of the Senate is not in favour of that system. I am prepared to support the compromise that most closely reflects the principles that underlie a proper electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that after some tortuous and sometimes very difficult negotiations the Opposition has come to the same compromise. The Opposition started from a different position but we have come to a reasonable compromise. I regret the fact that the Australian Democrats have not accepted that compromise. At no stage have they in effect been prepared to make any change at all. They have advocated compromise but they have not changed their own position. I think that is a great pity. But self-government will be established under this proposal. There will be a reasonable chance of the people of the ACT getting a secure and stable government for three years. Over the years, as the people of the ACT see how this system works, they may become comfortable with it and choose to keep it permanently, or they may pursue the interest which is reflected in the recent opinion polls and seek to change a system which is more compatible with that in the rest of mainland Australia. I would, of course, welcome and support such a move. But that is a matter which will now go before the forum in which it should be properly discussed, which is amongst the citizens of the ACT and their elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We are proceeding with a system which is not unique. I am amazed that supporters of proportional representation had to dash off and look in their books to find out what the d'Hondt system involves. It is actually much more common than any system in use in Australia. It is a system designed specifically to adapt proportional representation to the needs of Westminster government and to the needs of producing stable majorities. It is a system which has worked very well around the world. It is a great pity that so much nonsense and mumbo jumbo has been spoken about it. This system has the advantage that the ballot paper will not be complex. For all intents and purposes, the ballot paper will be exactly the same for voters as that which they used in the last Senate election. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the electoral system is going to be modified slightly further. It was a cause of some embarrassment to me that some people in advocating the previous consolidated d'Hondt system gave it the inglorious title of the McMullan-d'Hondt on the basis that they held me responsible for working it out. I am delighted that there has been a minor change sufficient to kill off the speculation. Although I confess to playing a part in devising the proposal, I would much prefer that it be called something else. I think this final change will kill off that idea forever. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that the other aspects of the electoral operation should be based on the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This arrangement is simple and it ensures consistency and ease of administration. I support the fact that the first election will be conducted under the principles of electoral funding and disclosure. The ACT Legislative Assembly will be the first parliament in Australia ever to commence its political process on the sound footing that electoral favours should not be bought and that contributions to political parties must be disclosed. I have always supported those principles and I support their application in this case. I hope that the elected government of the ACT will continue to do so, but that will be a matter for its members to determine. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer briefly to the planning legislation. This is one matter that is properly the business of the national Parliament, which will continue to have a significant responsibility to protect the national interest and the national capital aspects of the wonderful city of this Territory. Canberra does perform diverse functions and one of those functions is its role as the national capital. People in the ACT accept the uniqueness of that arrangement. They accept that the total planning autonomy that other States and Territories have is not appropriate in the ACT because of the peculiar national capital aspects of the city. That is as it should be. I welcome the fact that this principle is reflected in this legislation. In all the discussions that I have had with people in Canberra, the most fervent advocates of local autonomy have recognised that unique responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the legislation strikes the appropriate balance between local and national interests. This is a matter that needed a lot of detailed consideration. For all the criticism of it, the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) has done an outstanding job for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. It was mildly ironic, I suppose, that environmental activists, who for years saw the NCDC as their bete noir and felt that it did not protect their interests sufficiently, should have become its most fervent defenders when it was proposed that it be abolished. If there is one thing that one needs in politics, it is a sense of humour. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that the new arrangements be put in place now. I understand the point that Senator Jenkins made about the difficulty of transition. That is correct. But I do not believe that the people of the Australian Capital Territory would accept that self-government should be transferred and that planning should stay in some way in limbo. After all, planning is the most profound local issue on a day to day basis. It affects many people and has a profound effect also on the economic development of the city. So the new arrangement needed to be put in place. The National Capital Planning Authority is a proper instrument for protecting and developing the interests of the national Parliament and of the people of the rest of Australia in this Territory. Those interests will be protected by the continuation of the leasehold system. These functions will be carried out in conjunction with the territorial planning authority which will have the responsibility for implementing the Territory plan. We have a situation of 12 months of transitional arrangements which will require continuing oversight by the national Parliament and by an appropriately constituted parliamentary joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I use this opportunity to say that I hope that in that 12- to 18-month period the parliamentary committee will be reconstituted in a more appropriate form. I say `12 to 18 months', because at the conclusion of the 12 month period for the development of the national capital plan I believe it is very important that this Parliament-jointly, the Senate and the House of Representatives-review the national capital plan as proposed and does not simply take it as a matter that may or may not be appropriate for parliamentary disallowance. I hope that the committee deals with it as a proposal that is of very great national interest, because it is the plan to protect the national capital aspects of Canberra, a matter that has been developed over many years with the interests of a large number of members of this Federal Parliament, those from the ACT and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the primary legislation, because it creates opportunities for appropriate review and planning and public consultation, and it retains the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. I turn briefly to the Democrats' Bills and I will make some comments on them before concluding my comments about the Bills as a whole. The Australian Capital Territory (Protection of the National Interest) Bill, I think, is a waste of time. There is no need for it. There is a retained inherent power in the Commonwealth to protect the national interest in so far as it might be required, so there is no requirement for this Bill. I do not support it and I do not believe that the Senate should pass it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Australian Capital Territory (Establishment and Amendment of New Constitution) Bill is premature. The Government's proposal will put the ACT in substantially the same position as the Northern Territory. I think we should say to the ACT, to its people and to its elected representatives: `Get on with running the Territory within this proposed framework, which is an enhanced version of anything previously put forward for the Territory and which provides a substantially detailed and delineated framework. Get on with running it and, after you have tried it for a while, you may wish to suggest some changes and you may wish to propose some alternative constitutional format'. If so, that matter can be looked at that time, at our leisure, after the people of the ACT, through their elected representatives, have had a look at it and have decided whether or not they want to proceed in that direction and whether they think it is necessarily appropriate or desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> What I accept about the principle in the Democrats' Bill-although I think it is premature and I will not support it at this stage-is that if at some stage in the political evolution of the Territory such a demand emerges, the onus will be on the people in this Parliament to determine why they should not support the wishes of the ACT as put forward, rather than the onus being on the ACT to establish why it should be entitled to such constitutional protection. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not agree that it is appropriate for this Parliament at this time to be passing the Australian Capital Territory (Open Government, Probity and Citizens' Rights) Bill, but not because I have any difficulties with the framework of the administrative review proposed to be established in that legislation. I might disagree with the principle and the detail, but broadly I think the framework of administrative law which has developed in Australia under the Commonwealth legislation and which is substantially mirrored in the proposed open government Bill, if I can summarise it as such, has worked very well. It is a framework that needs review from time to time, and that is done by the Administrative Review Council very adequately. I am saying that, if we are to transfer self-government to the ACT, we should transfer decisions about the nature of the administrative review arrangements to that assembly for determination rather than have prior determination here. I will oppose those Bills for that reason, and I urge the Senate to do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to a point that was implicit in what I said about the constitution Bill and some of the other matters and that is implicit in the debate about the powers that are being transferred in the primary Bill: the arrangements being proposed are not set in concrete forever. There are aspects with regard to the powers that will be reviewed in 1990, and it may be that others will need to be reviewed subsequently. That is a matter which to some extent will come up in the committee stage and which to some extent, from time to time, will be capable of subsequent debate between the Government of the ACT and the Federal Government. I clearly have the view, as I expressed earlier, that in the long term the electoral arrangements may well be changed. There may well be a demand locally that that should be the case, and that is a matter that should be considered at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Hill that some of the safeguards and constraints built into the legislation and not reflected necessarily in the legislation of the other States may not be long term and may not last forever. However, I say with regard to those matters, as I said previously with regard to the Democrats' proposed constitution Bill: Let the system work. It is a very comprehensive and complex system, and it will be a very large task for the newly-elected members to set up a new government and operate the system that is being put before them-in some ways, a greater task than has ever been put on any newly-elected government, because it will have the unique combination of both State and local government responsibilities. Let it work. After the elected representatives have tried it and the people of the ACT have seen it, we may be approached by the ACT Government to make changes and the onus will be on the Commonwealth as to why it should not agree, other than with regard to national planning matters or other appropriate national responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will say two things. I welcome this important initiative: Firstly, as a matter of principle, it is a proper extension of the democratic process to this Territory; and, secondly, I think it is the right time for it to be undertaken. I would like to have seen it done some years before, but in some ways the delay has been used to good advantage and has been beneficial. It is the right time in terms of the evolution of this Territory, because we now have a healthy breadth and diversity of the ethnic origins of the people, of the economic base, of the cultural life, of the sporting activities and of the whole gamut of social, cultural, economic and political activities that make it appropriate that we should be self-governing, and because the transitional arrangements with regard to finances and administration have been adequately determined. I think it is appropriate in terms of efficiency and in terms of the extension of accountability. So I welcome this very important initiative. I welcome it also, as I said earlier, because it removes inappropriate business from this Senate and will enable us to more adequately discharge our other responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the last major transfer of such power to the ACT. There are some other areas in other territories of a minor nature that need to be examined, minor in terms of the number of people involved and the land mass involved, but still important to the people concerned: for example, the matter of the people of Jervis Bay. Nevertheless, a major transfer is involved and it is an important step. It is something which I think even those people in the ACT who currently are apprehensive will in hindsight come to welcome as a very major step forward. I welcome the fact that the majority of the people of the ACT have now come to see that self-government in some form is appropriate. Some of them would advocate a slightly different form of State or local government; and I understand that, because to some extent it reflects the diversity of the origins of the people of this city in that they have come from so many other parts of Australia and have had different experiences with State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that either half-way house would have been appropriate. To have given self-government to the ACT without giving it responsibility for the schools system or the health system-which would have occurred if we had not transferred State powers-would have been a sham, because if one looks at the media in the ACT one will see that two of the predominant issues reflected and about which concern is expressed here relate to the health and education systems; and a similar argument could be put with regard to planning if local government powers were not transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this major transfer of powers and the form in which it is to take place. I congratulate the Minister for the Arts and Territories, Clyde Holding, for the work he has done in bringing this matter to fruition. I particularly congratulate the previous Minister, Gary Punch, for the enthusiasm and verve with which he gave impetus to the self-government debate; and I also mention his predecessors, Gordon Scholes, Tom Uren and John Brown. I join others in supporting the community activists, particularly the ACT self-government campaign committee, for their work in improving this proposal. I thank the public servants who have been involved, particularly in the ACT Administration; and the media in Canberra for the constructive role they have played. I regret that there was some delay in achieving agreement. I welcome it now. I have great pleasure in supporting these Bills. I look forward to participating as a citizen, in a self-governing ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Finance still agree that, as he said on the Face to Face television program on Sunday, 9 October, one more bad monthly balance of payments figure-that is, coming on top of the figures then already recorded in July and August-will require the Government to review the economic strategy announced in the August Budget Papers? Now that we have seen a bad balance of payments deficit for September and a disastrous one for October, with a total deficit of $5.4 billion for the July-October period, does the Minister agree that his condition for such a review of economic strategy has been satisfied? In particular, does the Minister still agree that, as he stated on that program, any such review would require the Government to review its spending programs with an eye to making cuts in them or does the Government now simply propose to rely on a prolonged credit squeeze, via some of the highest interest rates in the industrialised world, to depress the economy sufficiently to make room for its promised tax cuts next July?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that it has taken Senator Stone so long to ask this question. I was fully expecting to get it as the first question yesterday. Since his demotion from the front bench apparently other people in the Opposition have to take priority. First, Senator Stone did not quote the comments that I made on the Face to Face program completely. He quoted one of the conditions that I had laid down as being those, should they all eventuate, which would probably require a change of strategy and particularly a change on expenditures. The other point to make-the Treasurer acknowledged this, I believe, last Wednesday-is that the Budget forecast for a $9 1/2 billion current account deficit now seems to be unlikely; it will probably be exceeded perhaps by $1 billion, perhaps by a bit more. However, it is too early to try to be any more definitive than that. It ought to be remembered of course that, apart from the normal seasonal factors in current account deficits, stocks of our major agricultural products-wheat and wool-were pretty well exhausted in the early part of this financial year. So the seasonal factor for this year is probably stronger than it is normally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, having said that, I make no attempt to establish a case that the October current account figure was anything less than disappointing. Of course it was disappointing. Indeed I acknowledged that on a television program with Senator Stone's successor as shadow finance spokesman, Dr Hewson. I also mentioned to Dr Hewson that Senator Stone was making the same predictions of doom and gloom immediately after the 1987 Budget and the October 1987 stock market collapse as Dr Hewson was making last Wednesday. His response was, `Don't quote Stone at me'. The probability now is that the current account deficit will be somewhat more, although probably not a great deal more, than the 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) that was forecast in the Budget. There is certainly no likelihood at this stage that it will be as much as 4 per cent. It is worth noting, particularly since the Opposition has asked this question, that in the final disastrous year of the Fraser-Howard regime, we had a current account deficit of 4 per cent of GDP when we were in the biggest depression that Australia has seen since the 1930s. That was a deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the depths of the biggest depression for 50 years-while this Government's will not be that high in the midst of what is almost one of the strongest periods of growth that we have had in recent years or in many decades.</PARA>

In the light of the Minister's flight of fancy in the latter part of his response to me about the comparison between the present situation and that of the last year of the Fraser Government, would the Minister care to complete the comparison that he was making by referring to the fact that, of course, at that time we were experiencing the tail end-and it was the tail end, admittedly-of a business investment boom?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories aware of an article in the Hobart Mercury of 27 October 1988 in which Mr Robin Griffith claims to have developed a process by which jarosite waste from the Electrolytic Zinc Co. (Australasia) Ltd plant at Risdon could be converted to inexpensive building materials? Given that Risdon is the only major plant in any westernised country that is allowed to dump jarosite at sea, will the Minister investigate why the process was not proceeded with when drawn to the attention of the Government about 15 years ago by the then General Manager of the company at Risdon, Mr Reg Barker? Will he undertake to investigate the feasibility of this process as an alternative to dumping jarosite at sea? Further, if the process proves to be a viable alternative, will the Government refuse to renew the licence for the EZ company to continue to dumping of jarosite at sea?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a proposal, which was put forward as far back as 1974, in relation to incorporating jarosite into building plasters and cements. However, all the products tested at the time failed to meet industry standards, and the project lapsed. In fact, apparently Mr Griffith put forward suggestions for a jarosite composite, containing building panel, at about that time. Apparently, the final work on this was postponed at his request, pending a patent application, which does not appear to have been proceeded with. Mr Griffith has also come up with another process comparatively recently which is currently being investigated by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Building Construction and Engineering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As one of the conditions of a sea dumping permit, EZ is required to investigate alternative means of disposal of the jarosite waste. Any feasible alternative to what is being undertaken at present that comes up as a result of that would obviously have to be considered seriously. At this stage, until the CSIRO has given us some final report on Mr Griffith's latest process, it is not possible to make judgments on the right of EZ to retain the sea dumping permit. As soon as I receive some information from the CSIRO I will inform the honourable senator further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I note the Minister's confession and remind him that not only two or three years ago-the example I gave-but just a year ago he expressed another view on the value of the dollar, when he said that from an industry point of view he would like to see the value of the Australian dollar around US65c to US68c. So this has happened not just a couple of years ago. The Minister has, on a number of occasions, essayed a view, presumably as a guidance to the people in his manufacturing constituency. I ask the Minister: Is he aware of the concerns which have been expressed, and not just by manufacturers? For example, an article was published this morning about a wheel manufacturer whose profitability on his exports to America have been considerably affected by the change in the dollar, and beef exporters have complained about the situation which now faces them. Is the Minister concerned that only last week the Executive General Manager of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Mr Russell Fynmore, said that at the dollar's current rates `I cannot see much future in investing in manufacturing for export'? What is the Government's strategy for dealing with these very changed circumstances that face Australian manufacturers? Should manufacturers assume that circumstances will again change? He has given guidance in the past. What is his guidance now?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition to any guidance I might give in a moment, let me first of all give Senator Chaney a few facts. The first is that while the dollar has appreciated as against a declining US dollar, the movement in respect of the trade weighted index has been very limited indeed in the last couple of months. In so far as exporters write contracts in US dollars, there are hedging mechanisms available in the market to protect them from currency fluctuations, and the better companies are using those mechanisms. If other companies wish to speculate more on the value of the dollar, having themselves made projections about what it is likely to do, that is their business and is probably not very good business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The liability, if any, for taxation on the loans cum gifts that were mentioned in the question is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation or his deputy to determine. However, I can supply some information from the Master Tax Guide and make a couple of other comments. The first point I want to make is that I understand that income is income, no matter how it is derived-whether it is derived legally or illegally; honestly or corruptly. It is still taxable if it falls within the classification of income. What is important is the substance of arrangements and not any contrived veneer that might be put over them. I will give a few quotations from the Master Tax Guide on the subject of the definition of income for taxation purposes. The Master Tax Guide states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Personal earnings from the performance of services whether as an employee or otherwise are clearly income, even though the services may be performed and the rewards received irregularly.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A gift by one person to another will not generally be regarded as income in the hands of the recipient. For example, a present given by a father to his son out of love and natural affection is not income in the hands of the son, but a tip given to a waiter or taxi driver is income in the hands of the donee because it is a product of the services which have been rendered.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the provision of a $2m loan was a function of the love and affection of the people who were providing the loans to Mr Hinze or for services rendered by Mr Hinze is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation to determine, not for me. The Master Tax Guide also states:</PARA>
<PARA> To be within the ordinary meaning of income, a receipt or benefit must be either of money or capable of being converted into money.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many more passages that have some relevance to this question, but I do not want to take up too much time. There are a number of passages that are relevant to exertion. It is difficult to determine what exertion might mean or be in this context. I notice that Mr Elliott has had a lot to say recently about whether the Australian Taxation Office should delve so deeply into the financial affairs of big business. I would be interested to see whether he has a view on whether the Tax Office should have a look at this particular case. I also noticed in today's Sydney Morning Herald a very good reply to Mr Elliott from Ross Gittins.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally in relation to the general question of people who hold public office receiving, either in cash or in kind, very valuable considerations, very valuable rewards or gifts, or whatever they might be, from those people in the private sector with whom they have some dealings as politicians, I would like to quote what I believe is an excellent passage-a passage which I believe is highly relevant to this-from Cyril Pearl's Wild Men of Sydney in which, in reference to one William Patrick Crick, Minister for Lands and Postmaster-General, among other things, of the colony of New South Wales prior to Federation, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>But I think that Crick, like many criminals, often saw all his actions through the rationalisation prism of an overwhelming ego. Even when conducting his own defence in the Criminal Court, he seemed to be unaware that there was anything wrong in taking bribes. `If a person came to me and offered me #10,000 to put through a matter for him, and I could put it through in a legitimate and honest way,' he told the jury, `I would take the amount, just as a barrister would take a #5,000 fee.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the quotation from Crick. Pearl's editorial comment was:</PARA>
<PARA>The manifest absurdity of this argument suggests that it was born of a deficient moral sense, rather than of conscious duplicity. And the reiteration of the honesty and legitimacy of his actions is significant.</PARA>

Will this assets test deprive many children from families with large assets but low or negative cash flow living in rural and isolated areas of a standard of education equivalent to that enjoyed by their urban counterparts who have access to schools paid for by taxpayers, and will the Government consider the total exclusion from the assets test of the education component of the total fees incurred by rural children who have to attend private boarding schools due to the non-availability of State boarding schools?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another free kick in the square. The isolated children's allowance has always been income tested rather than means tested. There is a difference between the meanings of the two. It has always been income tested, and when the new arrangements come into operation it will be means tested because an assets test will be added to the income test. I made the point in a speech a couple of weeks ago that all parents of isolated children receive an education payment. They will continue to receive that basic payment of $989 a year. Up to an extra $1,862 is available, subject to a parental income test, for a year 11 of year 12 student. There has always been such an income test. If a family has one child, that additional payment cuts out entirely at a family income of $24,399.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was announced in May that, as from 1989, parents who had assets additional to the house in which they lived and a curtilage in excess of $300,000 would not get that additional assistance. For farmers-I think that this was implied in the question-and for some other businesses, only half of the asset is counted, so the total net assets additional to the house in which the parents live would have to be $600,000. If anybody who has control of business assets of that size is not earning on them a sufficient return to have income tested himself way out of the range of the additional payment for the isolated children's allowance-and remember that that is just over $24,000 a year-and is not generating a great deal more than $24,000 a year with assets of $600,000, it means one of two things: either the asset is grossly overvalued or it is being grossly mismanaged.

Not only is there no case for governments intervening in a way that sustains ridiculous overvaluation of assets or the most horrendous mismanagement of those assets, but there is a very strong case for the Government not getting involved in such stupid activity. I would have thought that there was on the Liberal Party side of politics the odd person who might have understood enough about the way in which a market economy operates to realise that that is so. I am sure that Senator Stone understands why that is so, but I thought that Senator Chaney, and even Senator Panizza, would have understood it. Senator Chaney asked about drought.

I cannot imagine anybody on an income of that level or a great deal higher who would not willingly forgo his additional allowance in order to receive $600,000 worth of net assets in addition to the house in which he lives. I am a bit surprised that the Australian Democrats, who often thump their chests and bleat about equity and fairness, should come in here and bat for people to receive additional allowances when those people have net assets, additional to their home, of $600,000, while people with an income in excess of $16,950 do not get a full allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been aware for some time of Senator Coates's concern, as I have been concerned, about any threats to the Heritage Commission, but fortunately last week the Government was able to announce that the resources of the Heritage Commission were to be almost doubled-by the commitment of an extra $2m annually, including an extra 21 staff.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least I have given the workers of Ravenshoe $75m; those opposite have given them absolutely nothing. Turning back to this question, the commitment is for an extra $2m annually, including an extra 21 staff. I think that will have a significant effect. The only thing that I can agree with in the press releases that came from the forest industries and the mining lobby is that the Commission was behind. There were 3,500 places on the interim list that had not been dealt with and they had not been dealt with because the Commission seriously lacked resources. The additional resources which we are now able to provide will, I think, fix the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, if one looks at what the forest industries and the mining industries had to say, one will see that there are a couple of fundamental weaknesses in their arguments. The first argument that they seek to promote is that in some way places listed on the National Estate Register are in fact locked up; they cannot be exploited. But because Cabinet is going to look to a review, I made sure that I had a list done of what exactly was happening with the National Estate. It is sad to report that as far as the National Estate is concerned, because obligations under the Act are placed only on the Commonwealth-they are not placed on State governments or local governments-there are almost 70 places on the list currently being mined, drilled, logged or otherwise exploited. Hundreds of places have been removed from the list because if they are in the built areas they just do not exist any more, they have been knocked over; alternatively, if they are part of our natural heritage, they have been so modified by miners, loggers, or whoever, that they are no longer worthy of being on the list.</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that, far from locking it up, what we had hoped over the years was that in some way there would at least be some moral suasion on those who seek to exploit to, in some way, have a careful look. The facts are that the development lobby has continued to knock over places on the National Estate Register.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to implications for owners of land that might be put on the Register, there has been a suggestion in the press release to which Senator Coates referred that they ought to be compensated for some loss. The difficulty is that, whenever we ask the National Farmers Federation to name the farmers who have been so affected and who need to be compensated because their properties are worthless, it cannot give any names. When we ask the Mining Industry Council to give names of miners who need to be compensated, it cannot give any names. The facts are that this has been a smokescreen that has been going on for some years. It has been part of a deliberate attempt to confuse National Estate and World Heritage, both of which are very different concepts. In the case of the National Estate, no land use power at all is conferred upon the Commonwealth and that, I think, is what people have failed to understand.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates asked about section 30 of the Heritage Commission Act and whether or not it was a significant deterrent to mineral exploration, as has been claimed. The fact is, of course, that section 30 has never been used. It sits there in the Act, but it has never been used. I do not know of any mining company which currently thinks that suddenly this Government is about to use it, given that it did not, the Fraser Government did not and the Whitlam Government that put it in did not use it either. Obviously, it is a very difficult section to apply. The Government has not used it and has no current plans to use it. It provides no deterrent at all. If it did, all of those places being drilled, mined or otherwise exploited would not be being destroyed in the way that they are now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The activities of the officer of the Attorney-General's Department in the court on the original night that this matter was the subject of an application for an interim injunction were not at the direction of the Attorney-General, nor of anyone in the Attorney-General's Department, nor of the counsel conducting the case. It was obviously an error of judgment on the part of the officer concerned, acting in the public interest as he perceived it, but manifestly incorrectly. That was the subject of a detailed and extensive apology to the High Court yesterday by the officer in question through counsel for the Commonwealth. The judge in question, His Honour Mr Justice Deane, said that as far as he was concerned the matter was completely closed, and I think that is the way it should be regarded by us in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the larger question of the continuing litigation against Mr Toohey, since the matter is still before the courts it would obviously be inappropriate to comment in any detail about the matters of fact that are in issue in that case, particularly evidentiary questions. But since that inhibition is clearly not being felt by Mr Toohey himself, on the basis of his comments all round the media so far today, I think it would be appropriate for me to correct the record in a couple of significant respects and in so doing respond to Senator Walters's question.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's concern is not and never has been with the publication of material about the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) as such. Much more specifically, the concern has been about the publication of information which identifies former or current officers of ASIS or their contacts, which identifies current or former places of overseas operation of ASIS, or which falsely describes specific intelligence activities involving those officers or those places. Our concern is based on three distinct considerations, all of them equally important: first, the danger to the individuals affected; secondly, the undermining of the efficacy of the Intelligence Service that would be associated with such disclosures; and, thirdly, the damage to foreign relations which can follow from such disclosures. Obviously, a lot more could be said about each of those points, but this is not the occasion to go into that.</PARA>
<PARA> The corollary of what I have just said is that, generally speaking, it is not the Government's concern to seek to stop the publication of information of the kind I have just described which has already been published, whether such original publication was authorised or not and whether such previously published information was accurate or not. Often it is not. Such damage as is likely to occur from republication has in most cases already occurred. Maybe cases can be envisaged where renewed publication would be dangerous but, generally speaking, once some purported piece of information is on the record it would be both ineffective and oppressive to pursue its subsequent suppression. That is a key principle underlying the way in which we are approaching this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> In understanding the action that the Government is currently taking-not just a few weeks ago but right now-it is important to appreciate that the Government now has reason to believe that what Mr Toohey is planning to publish is not a mere article in the Eye or some other journal, not something dealing just with the purported naming of one individual officer in one overseas location, but a whole book purporting to name a great many individuals. A subpoena has been issued today out of the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney dealing with this matter and it will no doubt be the subject of further court proceedings. I make it clear that there is no reason why a book about ASIS as such should not be published. But there is every reason why such a book or any other publication should not contain previously unpublished information of an especially damaging kind, in particular information of the kind that I have already mentioned, that is, information identifying current or former officers, particular overseas locations or the particular activities of those officers in those locations.</PARA>
<PARA> The principles which govern these matters were extremely well articulated by Mr Justice Mason in the Fairfax case a few years ago. It is worth putting what he said on the record because it is an admirable statement not only of the law but of the principles that we all ought to recognise. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable, in our democratic society, that there should be a restraint on the publication of information relating to a government when the only vice of that information is that it enables the public to discuss, review and criticize government action.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the court will determine the government's claim to confidentiality by reference to the public interest. Unless disclosure is likely to injure the public interest, it will not be protected.</PARA>
<PARA> The court will not prevent the publication of information which merely throws light on the past workings of government, even if it be not public property, so long as it does not prejudice the community in other respects. Then disclosure will itself serve the public interest in keeping the community informed and in promoting discussion of public affairs. If, however, it appears that disclosure will be inimical to the public interest because national security, relations with foreign countries or the ordinary business of government will be prejudiced, disclosure will be restrained.</PARA>
<PARA>I said in this chamber a few weeks ago, at the outset of this whole matter, that Mr Toohey's protestations would be much more believable if he were prepared to swear that he has no previously unpublished material in his possession or control purporting to identify ASIS personnel, areas of operation or activities, or if he has such information that he has no plans to publish it. That remains the basis of our approach. This matter could be very quickly and readily resolved were Mr Toohey prepared to accept the kinds of principles that I have outlined, which will no doubt be understood and accepted, if not by Senator Walters, certainly by the overwhelming majority of Australians.</PARA>

Dr Carl Jordan from the University of Georgia was asked to have a look at wet tropics and the scientific base for the Commonwealth's case. He reported to the Queensland Government last March and is now wondering why he has never had any reaction to his report. Of course, the reason for that is pretty obvious. Like almost every scientist who has had a look at the wet tropics, he came down absolutely against what the Queensland Government was trying to do. In fact, I would like to quote one part of his report, which, I might say, I have seen. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>From an international perspective, logging of the Queensland rain forest would be the ultimate in short-sighted abuse of a world heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>He speaks with disdain of Queensland's plans to log virgin areas once again just to try to maintain a 60,000 cubic metre quota. He also speaks of how difficult it is-how, in his view, impossible it is-to have sustained yield forestry in a tropical rainforest regime. He says that it has never been successful anywhere in the world for more than a few decades.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that it was time, in view of Dr Jordan's evidence and, of course, in view of the revolt of the entire NORMA scientific committee that has taken place this year, that the Queensland Government-and perhaps even Senator Boswell-woke up, and that they might say they had been on the wrong tram. Perhaps it is time that the Premier, Mike Ahern, stopped agreeing to his environment Minister's request in Cabinet to spend more and more money on trying to knock the case over in north Queensland. In conclusion, I can only say about Mr Muntz that at a conference I attended in Surfers Paradise the compere, in introducing Mr Muntz, spoke of his German heritage. He said that Mutz in German meant `bright', but unfortunately Geoff meant `not very'.</PARA>

I refer to Senator Richardson's reply of 10 November 1988 to a question I asked on 9 November 1988 concerning Army rations. In relation to that latest Kelly fable, is it not a fact that there is an estimated $3.1m shortfall for all rations this financial year because of, firstly, a carryover of claims from 1987-88 amounting to a bill of $2.2m; secondly, $1.4m needed to produce ration packs for exercise Kangaroo 89; thirdly, increased packing costs and general price increases; and fourthly, costs for the bicentennial tattoo? Unless more money is provided, do the effects of this very serious shortfall mean: Firstly, that the `measly Beazley' diet recently imposed on the Army in New South Wales will now snowball to other commands; and, secondly, that in Land Command literally dozens of Army exercises programmed for the next seven months will have to be cancelled because Land Command does not have sufficient funds to feed the troops in the field? Or to put it another way, would our current ration resources allow only one brigade to exercise for less than two weeks?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very big increase. Senator Tate is right again; he always is. The increase over 1987-88 comprises basically the elements to which Senator Newman just referred. They are $1.7m for higher than anticipated carryover of accounts to 1988-89; $1.4m as a special requirement for combat ration packs for Kangaroo 89; additional requirements for the bicentennial tattoo of $500,000; and $900,000 for a number of other variations. The allocation of fresh rations to local commanders throughout Australia is determined on the basis of such factors as personnel living on the base and their daily activities. This type of expenditure is termed `non-discretionary'. An additional discretionary provision is allocated to cover exercises, field activities, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a consequence of the higher than anticipated carryover of claims into 1988-89, which was mainly for combat ration packs, the allocations to certain regions have been less than they estimated they would require. In most cases this has impacted on the level of discretionary expenditure. As part of the normal ongoing management of the Army budget, reviews are made of all financial allocations throughout the year. Subject to the outcome of these reviews it may be necessary to make adjustments in rations because there are fluctuations in the number of soldiers living in. In addition, there was higher than normal Army Reserve activity in the first half of the financial year. Local commanders have been requested to manage their allocations with regard to these factors and to make appropriate economies as necessary. Therefore, it is an internal Army management matter. Corrective action is already being taken to sort out the current local difficulties caused by the fluctuations outlined earlier in the rations vote. This has been achieved through reallocation of funds from elsewhere in the Army budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The rations available to soldiers have been, and remain, of a high standard in terms of both quality and quantity. There has been no decrease in the level of funds for the Army rations vote compared with 1987-88. Adjustments within the vote are a matter for Army management.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to comments made by the National Party Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, which suggest that the practice of providing cash advances for Ministers is not just restricted to Queensland but extends to other parliaments? Can the Minister assure the Senate that such a system is not available to Federal Ministers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that a modern day Machiavelli would write: If you are in trouble, try to spread the blame to others. It is quite apparent from what has happened in Queensland and the abuse of a variety of systems in that State that Mr Ahern is trying to imply that similar abuses occur in other parliaments. Of course, I cannot speak for every parliament in Australia but, from what I know of the systems that exists at the Federal level, it is very regrettable that the Premier is trying to sheet home that sort of association at the Federal level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no system for Federal Ministers or Opposition officeholders that provides cash advances to those people. Therefore, we are not able, if we liked to do so, to get a cash advance to pay for meals for friends, flowers or perfume for typists, housekeeping for spouses or have $100 each way on the favourite in the last. None of those options are available to Federal Ministers or Opposition officeholders. Indeed, we have a system that is fairly accountable. For a start, all car travel by Ministers and Opposition officeholders is published once a year. I guess one can take some sort of measurement from that as to the extent that it is used or abused. That can be further followed up by use of freedom of information provisions, as has occurred from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures for overseas travel by Ministers are also published every year. There is a small cash advance system for overseas travel by Ministers based on the type of travel allowance. But again, that basically has to be accounted for. Travel allowances for Ministers and Opposition officeholders generally are also published once a year. If all those systems do not work particularly well, we have the Estimates committees which can also follow up, examine and look for any hollow logs that may exist. Nearly all the conditions of Ministers and Opposition office holders are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and therefore are very much open to public scrutiny. For those who have not caught up with the news, I also add that those extra allowances paid to Ministers and Opposition office holders are now fully taxable because of the substantiation rules brought in some two years ago. This means an increase of $10,000 to $12,000 a year in the taxable income of most Ministers and Opposition office holders. I suppose I may be presenting a grievance on behalf of Ministers. However, as far as Senator Walsh is concerned, the clawback to the Commonwealth is fairly considerable.</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Ahern is thinking that the Commonwealth system is the same as his own, I wonder why he has contacted the Commonwealth Government to find out our procedures with a view to implementing them at a State level. It is a fairly desperate act for Mr Ahern to try to have an inquiry into not only the Ministers in Queensland; he also lumps the backbenchers into it. He proposes to lump the backbenchers into it hoping to throw the net out and catch someone else. When that does not work, he tries to smear all politicians. The reality is that everyone in this chamber, not just Ministers, has been smeared. There is no question of that. If one goes out into the sticks and talks to the people one finds that they believe members in this chamber all have their hands out for cash advances, credit cards or something else. It is a pity. As one colleague rather lamented to me the other day, we have to get all the odium and nothing to show for it.</PARA>

Clearly, the issue of supplying our bases by aircraft has been looked at by a number of Ministers over a number of years. It has been claimed in the past that it cannot be done because of the need to construct an all-weather airport and how difficult that might be. It has been Dick Smith's contention-not just recently, but for some time-that by using the Twin Otter aircraft which he is using on this flight we could in fact manage to supply at least some of the bases and transport scientists to and fro where necessary and that we could do that without the necessity to build an airport because this plane could land in some parts on the ice. I will be interested to see the results of Dick Smith's trip and just what comes from his findings. He has talked up a long way the Twin Otter and its possible uses, and I just hope that as a result of this trip he can prove that what he has been claiming for the past several years is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should thank Senator Coulter for giving me the opportunity to answer such a wide ranging series of questions on the greenhouse effect. He asked firstly whether I regard the atmosphere as a resource. I should say that concern for the integrity of the atmosphere is a legitimate responsibility of all Ministers. It is one that this Government has never shied away from, because it is one of the most environmentally responsible governments in the history of Federation. That is true, and I have to acknowledge the fine work done by my colleague, Senator Richardson, who, as Minister responsible for the environment, is one of the most effective Ministers for the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new processes announced last week by the Government-part of the package of Cabinet decisions referred to earlier by Senator Richardson-will ensure that environmental and resource development aspects are addressed in an integrated way. These processes include the establishment of a resource assessment commission and the development of a forestry accord and a national forestry inventory. Clearly, the policies for the resource industries are of fundamental importance in addressing problems relating to the atmosphere. These policies include the sustainable use of renewable resources, including forest resources. For the minerals and energy industries, policies include environment protection, efficient use of resources and energy conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second part of the question, about the finite nature of the atmosphere, concern for greenhouse-related issues and broader questions of climatic change must, I believe, be kept in perspective. No unequivocal cause and effect relationship has been established. Nonetheless, as I have indicated in recent addresses, we are putting into the atmosphere an ever-increasing quantity of greenhouse gases, and we have to have a responsible way in which to examine ways that we can mitigate any adverse environmental consequences of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the honourable senator's question related to the Energy 2000 report. The Energy 2000 report is a most misunderstood document. It should be read more frequently. If it were it would be seen as an inventory of energy resources rather than a long discussion paper about energy policies. However, I must say with respect to the work of my predecessor, Senator Gareth Evans, who chaired the initial Energy 2000 conference, that the issue of the greenhouse effect was not at that time enjoying the public attention that it enjoys now. The conference that Senator Evans chaired was a representative conference of State governments, energy associations and conservationists. I do not want to preach that they perhaps misconstrued their responsibilities then; I want to talk about what are in terms of the future the obligations of the Government to come to grips with the greenhouse effect, which is an issue that has rapidly gained considerable momentum in recent times and one which Mr Kerin and I have been addressing by way of a complete portfolio review. As recently as last Friday, at the meeting of the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, the meeting of State and Commonwealth mining and energy Ministers, we decided to compile under Commonwealth leadership a compendium of what is happening in the States and the Commonwealth on policies related to the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA> In reply to the fourth part of the honourable senator's question, yes, the National Energy Consultative Council can consider energy issues associated with the greenhouse effect. In fact on 14 September last, when I announced the establishment of a National Energy Consultative Council-a body, I should say, that arises out of the Energy 2000 report-I also announced that at the top of the agenda for its first meeting would be a consideration of energy policies against the background of the greenhouse effect and what we should be doing in terms of energy policy preparation in view of that greenhouse effect. I add that the National Energy Consultative Council is also a representative body, being made up, in part, of environmentalist representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> In reply to the last part of the question, about funding for basic data collection and analysis on the greenhouse effect, I draw the honourable senator's attention to the Prime Minister's response in the House of Representatives on 3 November to a question without notice from Mr Cohen. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government attaches a great deal of importance to obtaining a better understanding of the greenhouse effect . . . and . . . has initiated a review to find out exactly what the range of existing research is in this country and the potential in the light of that review for further research.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister further stated that if it appears that more funds should be made available to enhance research relevant to a better understanding of the greenhouse effect, that will be done. Against that background, I can assure the honourable senator that I would fully support additional funds if basic data collection and analysis on the greenhouse effect in the Government's view indicate the need for additional funding. Finally, my comments made at the National Energy Innovation Awards, to which the honourable senator referred, are comments that I do not think I need to reiterate now but they are comments which I stand by.</PARA>

<PARA>I was interested to read the report on the operation of the Student Assistance Act and also the press release issued by Mr Peter Reith, the shadow Attorney-General, and the then shadow Minister for Education, Mr Jim Carlton, on 24 March. The press release referred to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealing a saga of incompetence, cover-up and poor administration by the Government in dealing with billions of dollars of fraud against the Commonwealth. The documents included confidential minutes of meetings of the Government's fraud committee, various correspondence, an independent report from Price Waterhouse and some extraordinary cases of fraud. The press release outlined key features of the Price Waterhouse report into the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> the schemes where fraud and overpayment are potentially greatest are Austudy Tertiary, Austudy Secondary, Astudy and Absec. </PARA>
<PARA> ``the scope for fraud and overpayment against the Commonwealth in relation to the present student assistance scheme is substantial''-</PARA>
<PARA>that was a quote from the report-</PARA>
<PARA> the fact that the Department has 300 administrators who ``ensure applicants obtained maximum entitlements'' and treat recipients as `clients' engenders an attitude or ``service environment'' which ``creates risks''-</PARA>
<PARA>again, those are quotes from the report-</PARA>
<PARA>By contrast, no one in the Department was on full-time assignment to combat fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> the Department has a ``loose administrative control environment''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``virtually no analytical anti-fraud work has ever been conducted in the Department''. </PARA>
<PARA> strong criticism for the fact that ``no detailed review of applications processing has taken place since a `methods' study in 1982''. </PARA>
<PARA> the revelation of ``significant fraud in the research grants program''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``withdrawal from studies is the major avenue for overpayment in the student assistance scheme''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Departmental prosecution and investigation activity in the Student Assistance area has not been a high departmental priority''. </PARA>
<PARA> the proposal to conduct a survey ``aimed at measuring the incidence of fraud'' was deferred ``until a more opportune time in 1988''-</PARA>
<PARA>again, those are quotes from the report-</PARA>
<PARA> the report details cases of fraud which have been detected. One adult secondary student received $167 944 before being convicted and placed on a good behaviour bond. Another student received $1700 for free air travel between Townsville and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it continued. Documents extracted from the Attorney-General's Department on the fraud steering committee revealed attempts to play down the extent of fraud. Given all of that, I was surprised to see that those serious allegations were dealt with in one paragraph of the report. I read from page 1 of the report on the operation of the Student Assistance Act 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Act were introduced into the Parliament during 1987 to provide significantly increased penalties for attempts to defraud the Commonwealth's student assistance schemes and to bring investigative procedures and options for the recovery of overpayments into line with those available in the Social Security Act. The amendments were still before the Parliament at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems strange to me that while we have an independent report and indications from the fraud steering committee that gross acts of fraud are being undertaken by students, so little reference is made to them and there are no suggestions as to how they will be overcome. Penalties will do something about it rather than the report indicating future plans for schemes to be put in place to investigate those frauds. I do not feel at all assured by the report that mechanisms will be in place. I alert the Department of Employment, Education and Training that I for one will be keeping a close watch on the Department to ensure that those attempts at fraud will be investigated appropriately. I hope that attention will be given to that in the next annual report so that the Senate and the public can be assured that people will be brought to justice if they defraud the Australian taxpayer in a way that has gone on for many years, and ignored by the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1987 report on the operation of the Student Assistance Act arises out of the requirement in the Act, set by this chamber, that such reports be made. It is an interesting exercise now that we have received the first of these reports to go through it. Unfortunately, some of the tabulations are not of the type that would be readily useful to many people outside in trying to estimate what is going on with the operation of this Act. But, more importantly than that, the Government is now looking at a review of the postgraduate award scheme through the Higher Education Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training that was set up by an Act of this Parliament in the middle of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major problem in terms of the review as against the White Paper is that we are likely to find that there will be increased emphasis, following the Government's insistence, on national priorities-a term that has not actually been explained. My worry is that we are going to provide scholarships on the basis of public servants' perception of the national interest rather than on the basis of excellence. For example, I foresee that we are likely to find that people with second class honours in, say, commerce are preferred to people who have outstanding first class honours in literature. The ultimate distribution of scholarships resulting from an exercise along that line will severely depress the pursuit of excellence within our tertiary institutions, particularly within the various disciplines that are said not to be of great importance to so-called national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty in working out national scholarships is, I think, in the notion of who might set those priorities. It is interesting when one goes back through educational history to discover that a whole variety of people who could have benefited from the provision of scholarships in fact did not. One example that comes readily to mind is the problem that Einstein had in getting any support for his type of work because it was of theoretical kind. In fact, the bureaucrats of his time were unable to get their minds around it. Presumably it was also encompassed in what might be called at that stage `national priorities'. We are lucky that people of his type of genius managed to overcome the inhibitions put in their way by people of stunted vision. If we should embark on such a course here as the basis for providing assistance to our students, we will be embarking on a scheme which will be to the national detriment while it will be promoted by the bureaucrats as being for the national benefit and in accordance with national priorities. It will be an everlasting national disgrace if we do not seek to promote and assist people who have the capacites and the excellence and who have done the hard work to partake of further higher studies. Rather, we will be contributing directly to mediocrity. I think that that is the central problem that will confront us in this area as a result of the White Paper's philosophy. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the third satellite has been successfully launched and that Aussat Pty Ltd is now reducing its losses. The system's use was increased by 28 per cent and revenue was up by 40 per cent to $104m for the year, so apparently it is now on target for profits next year. The coalition parties welcome the fact that Aussat is on target to make profits. We recognise that Aussat is providing a commercial service to Australia, and I emphasise the words `commercial service' because it is our policy that Aussat should be privatised. Our policy is:</PARA>
<PARA> To enable this potential-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Aussat's potential-</PARA>
<PARA>to be fully achieved, the Liberal and National parties will transfer ownership of Aussat to the private sector by the sale of 100 per cent of its shares to the public, with preference given to Aussat employees. No foreign person or company will be permitted to own shares and no person or company will be permitted to own more than 15 per cent of the issued shares of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that that is the way to go for Aussat. The interests of all Australians would be served by Aussat being owned in the private sector. Page 10 of this annual report mentions pay television. Last week the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, made a speech about television in the next decade and repeated what was said by the Hawke Government in 1986, that there would be a moratorium on pay television until September 1990. But having said that, he went on to say in essence that the Department is now preparing an options paper and in due course, and some time before September 1990, the Minister will make a submission to Cabinet on what should happen with regard to pay television after that date. He talked about the use of Telecom Australia's fibre optic cable, whereas in this report Aussat talks about pay television being provided by way of a satellite service. Telecom's fibre optic cable, to quote what the Minister said, is not likely to be available until well into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties are not opposed to Telecom contracting to allow the use of its fibre optic system for pay television or any other service. We would welcome that. But Australians should not have to wait until that system is in place before they get access to pay television. By then some new, better or different system may have been discovered. What we say is, open up the service to enterprise and initiative now. That is our policy. Frankly, the Government's approach is just not good enough. We are committed to allowing the immediate introduction of pay television services, whether they operate by satellite, by cable or whatever system is available to some entrepreneur. This again shows the difference between the Hawke Government and the coalition. The Hawke Government is about words, empty rhetoric. There is a lot of talk about deregulation and freeing up the system. But with the Hawke Government it is always going to happen at some time in the future. The coalition is talking about doing it now. This arrogant and out of touch Hawke Government simply is not acting to address the concerns of the people of Australia for the late 1980s and 1990s. It should be fixing up coastal shipping. It should be fixing up the labour market. It should be concerning itself with the declining living standards of Australians. After the next election we shall see what the people of Australia have thought about this currently inactive, out of touch Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the remarks of Senator Lewis in relation to the annual report of Aussat Pty Ltd and in particular I welcome his comments regarding access to pay television and the delay that is being occasioned by Telecom Australia's insistence on the use of fibre optic cables. The community should be in no doubt as to why Telecom exercises such a monopoly control and such insidious influence over these critical decisions. One needs to look no further than the actual structure of Aussat to see that Telecom has 25 per cent of the ownership of Aussat and the power to appoint two directors, and of course it makes good use of that by having the Managing Director of Telecom, Mr Ward, and another senior director-in this instance the Director of Corporate Services-on the Aussat board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard that as a very unhealthy development. It is not conducive to encouraging Aussat to move to a competitive system. It is certainly not designed to encourage Aussat to take on Telecom in many areas where it is eminently better suited. As Senator Lewis rightly pointed out, a classic example of that would be direct broadcast satellite television. As we now know, this service can be provided in rural and remote areas, but Aussat has a much greater capacity to deliver services right across the board and to be highly competitive with Telecom. In fact, it has the capacity to compete not only in the educational market but in the hotels and clubs markets and in many ways to be the low cost alternative. But because of the manner in which Telecom is able to influence those decisions, I do not have a great deal of confidence that Aussat is going to be able to show any dramatic expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of utmost concern is that, despite all the cosmetic changes that are supposedly designed to inject a more competitive enterprise arrangements into government business enterprises such as Aussat, the fact remains that Aussat will still have to go cap in hand when it seeks funds for the second generation of satellite systems, which will need to come on stream by the mid-1990s. Despite all of what was said in the May statement, the fact is that Aussat's borrowings will remain subject to Loan Council scrutiny. Although the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will not have the power of veto over day to day borrowings of the magnitude of $600m, which is the sum generally thought to be required for the purchase of a second generation satellite system, those borrowings will certainly remain subject to Loan Council scrutiny. This is yet another example of a government business enterprise that is required to go cap in hand to government, that is not able to take risks out there into the marketplace and obtain funds on the merits of its case. The only way in which Aussat is able to obtain funds is via banks, which insist to a great extent on government guarantees. As a result, Aussat has what would otherwise be regarded as a very uncompetitive gearing ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> While the loss of just over $5m is not overly significant and there have been some encouraging signs of progress in relation to product development-and I think generally one can be pleased at Aussat making the most of its limited opportunities-the fact remains that it is still a cripple. It is still going to be a very poor relative of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and Telecom. It is not going to be in any position to flap its wings. While the present structure remains in place, one cannot have any great degree of confidence that Aussat will be a major contributor to satellite development around the world. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears from the 1987-88 annual report of the Australian Postal Commission that generally Australia Post is beginning nowadays to do quite a good job. I believe that is a result of some competition which it is now facing. I see from the report that Australia Post delivered over 3.5 billion articles of mail to over 6.5 million addresses in Australia. According to the report, 93 per cent of those articles were delivered within the advertised time and another 6 per cent were delivered only one day late. Unfortunately, the fact that 7 per cent of articles were not delivered within the advertised time certainly gets under the skin of a lot of people. Certainly, great difficulties are created by the one per cent of articles which are delivered more than one day late. After all, one per cent of 3.5 billion articles of mail is a lot of articles being delivered more than one day late. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also claims that productivity performance has increased substantially. Australia Post is certainly to be commended for this. According to the report, labour productivity rose by 3.7 per cent last year, which is about five times the national average of 0.7 per cent identified by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Australia's productivity must continue to increase if we are to become, or remain, internationally competitive. Quite frankly, the current rate of increase in national productivity levels is disgraceful. Australia Post may have started from a low level due to the lack of competitive pressure in the past, and that is possibly the explanation for its current rate of productivity increase, nevertheless, for whatever reason, the coalition parties certainly applaud productivity increases of this magnitude. Australia Post's return on assets is much better than that of many other government business enterprises. It is shown as 7.8 per cent compared with the return on assets by, for example, the Australian Industry Development Corporation-the annual report for which is also tabled today-at only one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the problem is the value of Australia Post's assets. One would wonder whether Australia Post should be questioned about the location and quality of its real estate holdings. Skyrocketing real estate prices around Australia, combined with Australia Post's accounting method of cost less depreciation, probably means that the true value of Australia Post's assets is substantially understated. Therefore, its return on assets probably is nothing like the 7.8 per cent shown in the report. Of course, the profitability of any enterprise depends in part on the tax regime that it faces. Australia Post is only now starting to face some of the tax imposts which have long burdened the private sector in Australia. I wonder how long it will be before Australia Post's voice is added to those of industry and the coalition parties in calling for substantial reform of the taxation system because Australia Post is now about to face those imposts. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things which concern me greatly relates to those developments whereby Australia Post appears to be cross-subsidising some of its related services. The report talks about Australia Post having a competitive edge in agency services. It talks about its unique national retail network and the fact that it currently provides travel related services. In one of today's newspapers we read that Australia Post will soon be selling letterboxes. All of these things are to be applauded if they are coming out of enterprise initiatives of offices of Australia Post, but they are not to be applauded if they are coming out of cross-subsidies arising as a result of Australia Post increasing its charge for ordinary mail from 37c to 39c. That is one of the reasons why the coalition parties would be looking to Australia Post to provide statements of income and expenditure on the basis of profit centres rather than a general statement of income and expenditure as set out in this annual report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments on the 1987 annual report of the Australian Postal Commission. I will deal first with a couple of aspects of its service which are outlined in the report. The first is its service performance targets as outlined on pages 16 and 17 where is it shown that 93 per cent of envelope mail was delivered within advertised times and in excess of 99 per cent was delivered within the advertised times or one day later. I think this is an impressive result but, apparently, it is not enough for Australia Post and a target of 94 per cent has been set for next year. I think that shows a level of commitment to providing consumers with an increasingly better service, and that is a credit to Australia Post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing that I would like to mention, moving through the report, is the excellent stamp issues during this bicentennial year. I must say that the `living together' series of stamps featuring Australia's leading cartoonists was particularly interesting. It highlighted a large number of important aspects of Australia's life and it was typical of the exceptional high standard of our stamp designs, many of which were very appropriate, as I said, in this our bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 60 the report lists information on the numbers of post offices and post office agencies in Australia as at 1 July 1987 and then 1 July 1988. I note that the number of post offices has decreased, as has the total number of agencies. This is indeed a concern as it has occurred in a period of population growth and a growth in mail volume and delivery points. What is perhaps of even greater concern is the prospect of even greater cuts which have come before us in recent days with respect to what are vital services. I refer to further closures or downgrading to agencies of other mechanisms which appear to be in the minds of planners within Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of Australians, and particularly Australians in rural areas, I do not believe will take this lying down. It is certainly something that the Australian Democrats protest about very strongly. If the rumours which have been abroad this past week or so are accurate, in particular the one that suggests that there are plans to close post offices in rural centres with populations of less than 3,000, I suggest that there would have to be an enormous backlash. It would be a backlash not just against Australia Post or even this Government but in the face of the privatisation policy of the Opposition it would be a backlash which, unless the Opposition repudiates that sort of plan, would occur in those electorates that the Opposition claims it supports. </PARA>
<PARA> In the year that the closures noted in this report have occurred I think we should note and place on the record that at least one beautiful new post office has opened-here in this new Parliament House. We do not appear to be subject to the restrictions that people in isolated and remote areas are being placed under through the closure of post offices and the downgrading of services. I think that people in rural and remote areas would have every right to be a touch cynical, especially as our post office is not only brand new but also operates on very extended hours which are not available to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite an irony that there is a prospect of the closure of post offices in the same week in which the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill has been passed by agreement between the Opposition and the Government. The post office will be a major point of access for people in the community to gain a tax file number, which will be very important to them unless they want to pay the top tax rate as a penalty for not having a tax file number. Once again, country people are disadvantaged. They face the prospect of having to travel long distances for services which are taken for granted by people who live in urban areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak on the 1987 annual report of the Australian Postal Commission. I do not think one can take a great deal of notice of the figures contained in the annual report of an organisation that has a monopoly in a wide range of areas. Certainly to use the language of `rate of return' in terms of financial targets demonstrates a lack of understanding of the inadequacies of that concept. It is quite clear, as my colleague Senator Lewis pointed out, that Australia Post operates on an historical cost valuation basis on many of its real estate holdings. In those circumstances the real rate of return is likely to be much lower than that publicly disclosed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is disappointing to have the sort of mindless reaction that we have just had from Senator Powell. I presume it is at first blush rather than considered, because this Parliament House has gone from a population of zero to in excess of 3,000, I think. In a situation where most of its inhabitants are inveterate users, at least indirectly, of the Australian postal system, it is not surprising that there should be an increased demand that must be met with that response. The problem in rural and remote areas quite often is that there is a declining demand. No-one is suggesting that people who need postal services should not have them. What is being suggested is that those services should be delivered more efficiently. That is what is behind the concept that Australia Post is valiantly trying to float at the moment of contracting out and franchising. I would support that approach because--</PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This report is the third report prepared by the Joint Sub-Committee on Variations to the Plan of Layout of the City of Canberra and its Environs and covers Variation 1988/4. </PARA>
<PARA> Variation 1988/4 contains two proposals to vary the City Plan-one to rectify the encroachment of a driveway onto Commonwealth land in Bruce; the other to provide for an access for a residential development in Isaacs. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the proposals were only gazetted on 14 October 1988, the ACT Administration asked that we look at these proposals quickly. The NCDC, following public consultation, received an objection to the Variation. The Joint Sub-Committee held a public hearing on the Variation last Tuesday, 15 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues were raised at the public hearing. In relation to the driveway encroachment in Bruce, it was pointed out to the Joint Sub-Committee that the house on the block concerned was prominent and the siting and design of it did not blend in with the topography. Special building conditions were imposed on houses in the Bruce south area. However, these conditions were not so well-enforced in the later stages of the development and therefore this house is at the lower end of the acceptability range. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, there were changes to the development plan which took in the Hill Reserve behind the Bruce south development. Residents were neither consulted or informed of the changes to the nature-cum-fire trail nor were they consulted on the construction of a pedestrian access in the gully. </PARA>
<PARA> The Isaacs proposal provides for an access road to enable development of standard residential blocks by the Housing Industry Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The briefing notes provided to the Joint Sub-Committee on this proposal by the NCDC and ACT Administration were misleading. The notes indicated that the access road was to be constructed when in fact it had already been built. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that developers should not seek approval from the Joint Sub-Committee for gazettals which are of a retrospective nature. An administrative process which allows such a situation to occur is clearly inadequate and this causes a serious concern about how future private sector development will proceed. The current procedure which enables private developers to pre-empt the parliamentary approval process must be revised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Sub-Committee has approved the two proposals in Variation 1988/4, as the Bruce proposal is a minor road addition and the access road in Isaacs is the only logical means of sub-dividing the block. In so doing, the Committee expresses its concern that the NCDC did not ensure compliance with the building conditions in all instances in the Bruce south development and that there was no public consultation following changes to the development plan which takes in the Hill Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is also concerned that the ACT Administration allowed construction of the access road in Isaacs to proceed when there was still uncertainty about its status. Seeking retrospective approval for a variation to the road plan of Canberra makes a mockery of the parliamentary review procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> In future any project for which there is even a slight possibility of the inclusion of a public road should be sent to the Joint Parliamentary Sub-Committee for approval as early as possible in the planning process. Otherwise the private sector land development process will simply become a means for avoiding public scrutiny of Canberra's development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now to debate three Appropriation Bills which cover the appropriation of the bulk of the funds which are required for the carrying on of government over the coming year. This debate presents an opportunity for the Opposition and, indeed, the whole of the Senate to debate generally the Government's record and program. The Opposition welcomes the opportunity that this debate provides. Indeed, I am somewhat surprised to find that no less than 39 senators have indicated their desire to speak in this debate. I think that reflects the level of concern which there is in this chamber about the situation in Australia today. The Opposition, for its part, faces an embarrassment of charges to make against the Government. The difficulty will be not merely to limit the time of this debate but to limit the scope to ensure that the charges that we make against the Government are understandable. In fact, one could put in months of debate on what is clearly going wrong with the Government's various programs. It is an unfortunate fact and a concession to reality that we have to restrict the debate within the time available to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to start the debate by indicating that I will move an amendment in relation to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-89 which focuses on some of the Opposition's key concerns. The amendment reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate condemns the arrogant and out of touch Hawke Government for the failure of its economic policies and its maladministration in areas such as Aboriginal affairs and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and, in particular, the Senate condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) producing stagnant productivity, high inflation, a continuing balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates which are hurting business and home buyers alike;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) raising, then dashing, Aboriginal expectations with unrealistic and divisive promises on national land rights and a so-called Treaty and for appalling mismanagement at both ministerial and bureaucratic levels; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) coercing participation in the ABS Household Expenditure Survey in the face of substantial doubt about its validity and legal basis,</PARA>
<PARA>and calls on the Australian people, as they have done in by-elections this year, to reject the Hawke Government and support the policies of the Liberal and National Parties, which reflect community values and which will deliver improved living standards for those millions of Australians who have been abandoned by a Labor Government now totally out of touch with their hopes and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendment refers to a government which is arrogant and out of touch. One need go no further back than yesterday to see an example of why the people of Australia are so disenchanted with the Hawke Government. Yesterday during Question Time Senator Patterson rose in her place and asked the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), representing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), a question about the impact that high interest rates-and as a result, the high cost of buying a house-were having on Australian families and the preparedness of young Australians to undertake the rearing of children. The fact is that we face a very low birth rate in this country. We face a situation where we do not reproduce our own population. It is increasingly clear that many young Australians have a choice between child bearing and child rearing, and home ownership. That is a comparatively recent phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad fact is that the extraordinary price of housing and the very high interest rates have combined to confront many young Australians with an unpalatable choice. That is a matter which has been the subject of public comment by bankers, people in the home lending industry generally and people who are concerned simply with the impact this is having on society. What sort of response did we get from Senator Cook? We got a response which was abusive of Senator Patterson. He suggested that she was drawing a long bow in making this connection between the ability of young Australian couples to plan for a family and the extraordinarily high financial demands which are made upon them if they wish to own a house-something which has been part of the normal ambitions of most Australian couples. That was but one example of a Government which has failed to keep in touch with the people who elected it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook comes from my State of Western Australia. By his reply he might as well have come from the moon. He was apparently totally unaware and unconcerned about the very real pressure which people are feeling. The fact that lending institutions can say to young couples, `We will require a commitment from you that you will be a two income family; there will be a postponement of child rearing for 10 years' is most extraordinary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is institutionalising the double income, no kids family. If one stops and thinks about the welfare of our country and our society, what could be more central? I pause on that point because I think it encapsulates what can be described in a lot of statistics. Much of this debate will go to what is wrong with the economy, but that simple area, so central to the lives of so many Australians and to our functioning as a country and as a society, encapsulates much of what the economic theory will be about. We are concerned about the position of the men and women of Australia and the pressures they are being put under by this arrogant and out of touch Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is that sort of example which explains the vast disenchantment with the Labor Government. I have agreed to restrict my time in this debate in the interests of allowing other speakers to participate, so I do not have time to dwell on the Labor Party's misfortunes in the by-elections of this year. Let me simply mention the by-election in the Western Australian State seat of Balga, when the unlamented ex-Premier Burke went his way. We had a by-election in one of the strongest Labor seats in Western Australia, and the swing was close to 23 per cent. I have certainly never before worked in an election where there has been a swing of nearly 23 per cent. It is hard core Labor country, full of battlers and people on modest to low incomes-people who traditionally have supported Labor. The simple explanation as to why such a huge proportion of them swung to the Liberal Party can again be encapsulated in the following example: A man handing out Liberal how to vote cards in the polling booths to whom I spoke said to me, `Senator, I have voted Labor all my life and I am voting Liberal now because I cannot pay my bills. I work just as hard as I did before but I cannot pay my bills and I have to find an extra job to do at night just to keep my head above water'. That person represents what this Government has done to the average earners of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who want a technical description relating to this, a paper published recently by the Economic Planning Advisory Council shows graphs of the taxes paid by Australians. One can see that the average amount of tax paid by income earners at different levels is growing and growing. It is fascinating. In recent years there has been a bit of a downturn in taxes that are paid by high income earners, but taxes have not been reduced for average income earners, or for the very large number of people on salaries of about three-quarters of average weekly earnings-and one should remember that 70 per cent of Australians earn less than average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had an interesting set of priorities. It reduced company tax by 10c on 1 July and told the average earners of this country that they could wait at least 12 months for a tax reduction. There was no tax reduction for them, but as from 1 July this year there was a reduction of 10c in the company tax rate from the previous 49c in the dollar. There is no relief for the average wage earner until just before an election. The breathtaking cynicism of the Government's approach to this matter is, again, the simplest explanation of why so many people deserted the Labor Party in by-elections in the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the high interest rates and high tax rates which have put such pressure on suburban Australia and on rural Australia are a conscious part of Government policy. It is this Government which chose to postpone tax cuts until just before an election. It is this Government which said to the trade union movement, `There will be no tax relief for you. We will have a wage-tax trade off next year when it suits us-next year, an election year, but nothing now'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has locked itself into spending policies and wage policies which mean that one of the few weapons it has to cope with Australia's current economic difficulties is interest rates. So, as a conscious act of policy, the Government has shoved up interest rates in a way that has impacted on everybody in this country who is buying a house, everybody who is running a farm and everybody who is running a business. That is not some accident of international trade but a conscious act of Government policy. That is the Hawke-Keating policy for Australia, and it shows no regard for the welfare of the people who elected this Government. All of the Government's para- meters have been set for political purposes. They have been set to meet the timing of the next election; they have not been set to meet the economic welfare of Australia and they have not been set to meet the economic welfare of the individual people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternative strategies have been available to the Government. The Government could have given earlier tax cuts and engaged in some arrangement with the trade union movement in a tax-wage trade-off, as it has promised to do next year. That course was open to it. The option was open to it to take a harder line on expenditure. Last year, private meetings were being told by Senator Walsh that there were a couple of hundred programs that could have been tackled. The Government chose, in turn, to knock back basic reforms in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees continued waste in the field of industrial relations and growing amounts of industrial disputes, but it knocks back basic reforms and refuses to countenance them-one of the avenues which would have enabled us to have a more productive economy and enabled the people of Australia to have a high rather than a low standard of living. The big concern, the concern which is reflected in our amendment, is that the position in which we find ourselves now is even more fragile than the pressure on individuals would indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened over the past two years is that, since Mr Keating said in 1986 that we were headed for the status of a banana republic, things have not got better; they have got worse. What has changed since 1986 is that the price of our commodities has improved. The prices at which foreigners will buy Australia's basic exports have gone up since 1986. The terrifying truth is that in relation to our trade in goods and services, what we actually sell abroad and what we buy from abroad, the gap has become bigger, not smaller. The truth is that in physical terms, if we measure what we sell against what we buy, our trade balance is worse now than it was two years ago. That means that next time we have a drop in our commodity prices-nobody predicted the recent increases, and we know how volatile commodity prices can be-we will have even more significant problems that we had in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen if there is a dropping away of our trade figures because the price of commodities falls? I simply remind those people who are groaning under high interest rates now that one of the weapons the Government will have to use then to cover our appalling trade balance will be a further dose of high interest rates. That is the strategy that the Government will have to follow. That is the hope that this Government is offering to the people of Australia in the Budget that is represented substantially by these Appropriation Bills. The fact is that the Government has got it dramatically and severely wrong. Our merchandise trade balance-in the end this is our living as a country-our export of goods less the import of goods, has deteriorated rapidly. The trade deficit for the first four months of this year, at $1.64 billion, is more than twice the size of the deficit for the same period last year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a bit of a sense of complacency in one section of the community in Australia, and that is the business community. Quite a few sections of the business community are sitting back and enjoying the high commodity prices. I remind the Senate and the business community that suburban Australians, unlike the people who elected Senator Colston, who is sitting opposite me in the Senate now, are feeling the pain. Much of the big business end of town is not feeling the pain at the moment. However, let me remind the big business end of town that one sees from any of the key economic statistics that we remain in a perilous position, very akin to our position in 1986. This relates not just to the imbalance in our trade. Our inflation rate to September was 7.3 per cent and it was 4 per cent in the United States of America and Canada. It was 0.5 per cent in Japan and a little over one per cent in West Germany. So inflation is twice the rate of that of our Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) trading competitors. Our wage rises are twice to three times as high. Interest rates in Australia are 15 per cent and rising compared with 10 per cent in the United States, a little over 3 per cent in Japan, 6 per cent in West Germany and 13 per cent in the United Kingdom. Our tax rates are uncompetitive and our productivity is stagnant. </PARA>
<PARA> Statistics have been issued in the last few days which show an appalling productivity situation in Australia. We could enter into all sorts of fancy arguments about the causes of that-the shift towards a more service orientated economy, you name it. The truth is that our productivity level, not just labour but labour and capital in Australia, is going up at about half the rate of OECD countries. That is a situation which guarantees that our comparative position is getting worse instead of better. Stagnant productivity is one of the brilliant gifts that the Australian Labor Party has given to Australia. We do not congratulate it on that; we condemn it. We have a high foreign debt which is still growing, and it will continue to climb given our continuing trade imbalance. Real personal incomes are squeezed with the combined effects of personal tax and interest rates, and industrial disputes are rising. The situation is that we therefore have a very fragile economy at a time when the men and women of Australia are broadly saying, `We have had enough. We are sick of this squeeze and we want some relief from the Government'. The truth is that the totality of what the Government is doing simply means that the chances are that things will get substantially worse rather than improve. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the future hold under Labor? I think it can be fairly said that for the average man and woman in Australia the future holds more of the same or worse, and that is not an adequate mess of potage to be serving up to the Australian people. The fact is that any weakening of our export prices will accelerate our debt problem and put more pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that there are still alternatives that the Government could follow. Probably the most central changes that could be made are changes to the labour market. We indicated in detail the sorts of changes we wanted in the recent debate on the industrial relations legislation, but the truth is that the living standards of Australians are sacrificed in myriad ways by the Government's failure to come to grips with defects in our labour market. There are areas of conspicuous waste on our waterfront; there are areas of conspicuous waste in transport, not least in coastal shipping; and there are areas of conspicuous waste in industries like the coal industry, which has a strike record of 40 times the industry average. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things could be done to make the Australian economy more efficient. The Government's own McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport said that inefficiencies in the transport sector because of lack of competition means that grain growers on average are paying $10 per tonne too much in transport charges. If we want to understand why Australians are poorer than they should be, it is necessary only to look at some of those areas of conspicuous waste brought about by lack of competition. Think of the farmers who, in recent bad seasons, have gone broke or nearly broke, and think of the difference it would have made to them if they had been getting $10 per tonne more for their grain because of an efficient transport system. It is in those areas of reform that this Government has totally failed. In this debate on the Appropriation Bills I make the point that the available alternatives, the more constructive approaches which could have been adopted by the Government to increase our national wealth, have too often been ignored, and we therefore have a very gloomy prospect for too many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to close by referring briefly to the position of Australian families and by going back to the arrogant and out of touch Senator Cook. Senator Cook, in response to Senator Patterson yesterday, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record in terms of assistance to families in Australia and its record on the provision of public housing is second to none. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the provision of public housing, when the Hawke Government came to power there were about 100,000 Australians on public housing waiting lists. Five years later there were 150,000 Australians on public housing waiting lists. That is the brilliant record of the Hawke Labor Government-50 per cent more Australians on waiting lists for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes. It has been prepared to help 10 per cent or so of families through the family allowance supplement. The truth is that all other families have seen the terms of trade move against them, with no adjustment to the family allowance and no adjustment to the taxation system to take into account their position. Those Australians who have borne the heaviest brunt of the financial burdens under Labor have been middle income families with dependent children. This Government has a disgraceful sense of priorities. It has ignored that substantial group of its own supporters but, most importantly, it has ignored that group of people who are doing something fundamental to the nation's good-bringing up the next generation of children. My final remark is that some adjustment of both the taxation and the welfare systems in favour of families with dependants is grossly overdue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rate of growth has been reduced. There is very slow growth. If the honourable senator would like to stay for the next 20 minutes or so, I will inform him as to the reasons. The process of adjustment will also enable the development of new, dynamic export orientated manufacturing industries in the Australian economy. The Federal Government's Budget strategy and macro-economic policies have a fundamental role in setting the right conditions for structural adjustment in the Australian economy. Last year's Budget and the economic statement of May this year made substantial reductions to Commonwealth expenditure in order to reduce domestic demand in the Australian economy and to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement which has been an important objective of policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to dwell on the public sector borrowing requirement for a moment, because I think in that area we have on the record a major achievement for the Hawke Government. For example, in 1983-84, the first full year of activity after we were elected in 1983, the Commonwealth Government's net public sector borrowing requirement constituted 4.2 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, but in the last financial year, 1987-88, instead of 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product, or Australia's national income, being accounted for by public sector borrowing there was in fact a negative public sector borrowing requirement of minus 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a very big turnaround in the records. When Senator Chaney's leader, Mr Howard, was Treasurer of this country and Senator Chaney was a Minister in the Government led by Malcolm Fraser, public sector borrowing totalled about 4 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. Now, as a result of the policies of the Hawke Government, there is no net borrowing occurring at the Commonwealth level. So there has been a big change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the period of the Hawke Government there has been a change in budgetary strategy from the high economic growth of its earlier years. This has been necessitated by the dramatic decline in Australia's terms of trade, which is, of course, the ratio of the prices we receive for our exports to the prices we pay for our imports. In the 1985-86 financial year those terms of trade declined by over 10 per cent and in 1986-87 they declined by over 4 per cent. That decline, as we are well aware, is outside the Government's control and essentially reflects the long term decline in international commodity prices compared with the prices paid for manufactured products. However, I am pleased to note that in the last financial year, 1987-88, there has been an increase in the terms of trade, that is, a relative improvement in our export prices compared with our import prices, of 8.2 per cent. That has contributed to national income growth, to gross domestic product growth, in Australia. That turnaround has also meant encouraging news in terms of Australia's foreign debt. Senator Chaney interrupted me a moment ago to mention foreign debt. The record is that in 1986-87 Australia's net external debt-and I am talking about the net debt-was $82.1 billion, or 31.5 per cent of gross domestic product, but by the end of the 1987-88 financial year it was not 31.5 per cent of gross domestic product; it had in fact been reduced by over a full percentage point to 30.4 per cent. The growth in the foreign debt has been slowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone is well aware, the great part of the foreign debt owed by this country is owed not by the Commonwealth Government or, indeed, by State governments but by the private sector, the capitalistic sector, of the economy, which has borrowed overseas in recent years to finance large takeovers. That is for the record. In fact, the relative amount of foreign debt, both government and private, has been stabilised. In relation to gross domestic product, which is growing strongly, the ratio has fallen significantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important thing about this Government's policies is that the Government has moved to correct external imbalances without inducing recession or attacking living standards directly. The Government has been restructuring the economy and overcoming external constraints by pursuing a strategy of restraint with equity. For example, the Hawke Government has rejected outright the traditional, conservative, Liberal strategy of shifting the burden of economic readjustment on to the poor and the lower income groups in the Australian community. That was the sort of strategy adopted in the late 1970s and the early 1980s in this country when Senator Stone, who is now in the chamber, was over the road as the head of the Australian Treasury. That was the deliberate strategy of reducing the level of demand in the Australian economy to adjust the economy. As a result of reducing the level of demand, which happened quite rapidly, to try to check the rate of inflationary price rises in the community, more and more Australians were thrown out of work. It is a fact that, in the last 12 months that Mr Howard was Treasurer, 186,000 Australians were thrown out of work; 186,000 were thrown on the industrial scrap heap as a result of Mr Howard's policies, which Senator Stone advised him to adopt. Those were the sorts of policies of honourable senators opposite when they were in government. They deliberately adjusted to external circumstances by strongly reducing the level of demand in the Australian economy. As a result, 186,000 Australians were thrown on the industrial scrap heap. As a result of their policies, 186,000 Australians were thrown out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 Budget will continue the policy of fiscal responsibility adopted by the Hawke Government. It is a matter of record that the Budget deficit has been progressively reduced since 1983-84 and, in fact, in the last financial year moved into a significant surplus of over $2,000m. </PARA>

The turnaround from the prospective deficit of $9,600m for 1983-84 to a surplus of over $5,400m this year in fact amounts to $15 billion. That is the turnaround in the finances of the Commonwealth as a result of the policies of fiscal responsibility which have been practised by the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone and recently other honourable senators such as Senator Parer, Senator Messner and Senator Panizza have claimed that the Hawke Labor Government is a high tax government. That is the sort of claim that has been made by those people. However, the fact is that when they were in government-and Mr Howard, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in this country, brought down five Budgets in the period 1978 to 1982-they were not fiscally responsible. Their very record in government shows that the people who now sit on the Opposition benches in this place, despite their rhetoric that we are a high tax government, were not fiscally responsible. That is the record. That is the legacy of the Liberal Party and the National Party when they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> What they preferred to do when they were in government was not to be fiscally responsible at all. They preferred to have Budget deficits. That was what it was all about. That was the easy way out. It was a case of the traditional, soft option of conservative, Liberal Party governments to have the easy way out and run up a Budget deficit instead of taking the hard way out and ensuring that their expenditures at the national level were covered by revenues. In not one of Mr Howard's Budgets-and he brought down five Budgets-were his expenditures covered by revenues. That is the record for the period nationally from 1978 to 1982-a Budget deficit in every year under Mr Howard when he was the Liberal Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it is particularly interesting to note that in 1982-83-that is, the last financial year when Mr Howard was in control of the Treasury and Senator Stone, as I pointed out earlier, was across the road at the Treasury Department advising him-the Budget deficit came in at 2.7 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That was the record. The Budget deficit in that financial year was equivalent to over one-fortieth of Australia's gross domestic product-broadly defined, Australia's national income. The prospective deficit that they left for us in 1983-84 was not 2.7 per cent but in fact 4.2 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That is the record of these people when they have the chance to sit on the treasury bench and pull the economic levers and run the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The record shows very clearly that when the Liberals and the Nationals are in power they prefer to have Budget deficits rather than government expenditures covered by revenues. They would not face up on the revenue side of the Budget in that whole period when Mr Howard was the Treasurer from 1978 to 1982. Instead, we have a $5,000m surplus in prospect this financial year, something that Mr Howard never achieved as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way of turning this whole debate around, of turning around the rhetoric of Senator Stone, Senator Parer and all the others who sit opposite and who say that Labor is somehow a high tax government, is to look at their record on expenditure. That is the other side of the Budget. That is a very illuminating examination. When one looks at the outlays side of the Budget one sees that, for example, in 1982-83-Mr Howard's last Budget-government expenditures constituted 29 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That was their record. In the Budget brought down by Mr Keating in August it was not 29 per cent of the Budget taken up with government spending; it was not 28 per cent; it was not 27 per cent; it was not even 26 per cent. In fact, the level of Commonwealth outlays through the Budget this financial year is estimated to be some 25.6 per cent, a massive reduction on the record of Mr Howard and Senator Stone, the dynamic duo, when they were in charge of the Australian economy from 1978 to 1982. That was the record: 29 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product taken up in government spending, compared with 25.6 per cent in prospect this financial year. The record of the Liberal Party and the National Party in government is one of high expenditures and a Budget deficit. That is their record. However, Labor has cut government expenditure to 25.6 per cent of gross domestic product and has a $5,000m surplus as well. That is Labor's record. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for the fall in the ratio of revenue to gross domestic product this year relates to the Budget measures on the excise on beer. For example, last financial year some $1,400m was collected in excise on beer. It is estimated that this financial year some $850m will be collected. So there has been a significant reduction of some $600m in that excise tax. It is pleasing to note that the excise on beer is now based on its alcohol content. The objective of that measure was to cut the retail price of beer and, in that way, to reduce the consumer price index through the price of that very important commodity. Consequently, that will help to assist the disposable income of the many working families in Australia. There has been a very significant reduction in excise revenue in prospect for the consumer price index and an increase in the disposable income of households as a result of that reduction in beer excise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget surplus of over $5,000m that I have spoken about paves the way for further personal income tax reductions next year. I am sure that there will be significant personal income tax reductions during calendar year 1989. Of course, that will have the effect of boosting the disposable incomes of Australian families. I am sure that both Senator Foreman and the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who are in the chamber, would wish those tax cuts to focus on lower and middle income families in Australia, because they are the ones who are in particular need. I will certainly be doing all I can to stress to the Government that that is where the focus for the income tax reductions should be during calendar year 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget forecasts are for 3.5 per cent growth in real economic activity this year. The figure is down a little on the 3.8 per cent of last year, but in line with that we predict that the total number of persons employed in the Australian economy will grow by 2 3/4 per cent compared with 3 per cent last year. That is still a very high rate of employment growth compared with other developed countries. As a result of that 2 3/4 per cent estimated growth in employment during the current financial year, the Government expects that the average number of persons who are unemployed on a monthly basis will fall to about 7 1/4 per cent compared with 7.8 per cent last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record is one of creating over 1,100,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. In respect of the Liberal and National parties it is very important to look at what they have said in the past, because it is always very illuminating. They play on the assumption that the public has a very short memory. Therefore, it is very important to document what conservative politicians have said in the past. It is illuminating to look at what the Liberals said during the election campaign in 1983 when the present Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, promised that in three years he would create 500,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. I well remember various conservative politicians scoffing at that claim. Based on their past record in government, that was all they could do. No doubt Senator Boswell was out on the hustings in Queensland scoffing at the claim made by Mr Hawke that some 500,000 new jobs would be created in a three-year period. Of course, the record of those opposite in government was one of destroying jobs, not creating them. So one can understand their scoffing. </PARA>
<PARA> In just over five years of Labor government in Australia we have not only achieved 500,000 new jobs in three years but the number of new jobs has gone up to 1.1 million. Overwhelmingly, those jobs have been created in the private sector. They have not been created through some sort of Liberal-described bandaid or make-work schemes. It is a matter of record that the average annual rate of new job creation under the Hawke Government has been exactly 3 per cent per annum. There has been 3 per cent growth in employment per annum under the Hawke Government. The record of the Liberals, when Mr Howard was Treasurer, was not 3 per cent, 2 per cent or even one per cent: Mr Howard's average annual growth in employment was 0.7 per cent. Under Labor the rate has been four times as high. If one compares it with the last year in which Mr Howard was in charge of the Treasury, one sees that Labor's rate was an infinitely better result because he destroyed jobs in his last year. A total of 186,000 Australians were thrown on the industrial scrap heap when Mr Howard was in his dying days as Treasurer of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus on a couple of key areas in the Budget, particularly in regard to social security, and to make the point that in the Budget there is a very important increase in the payment of the family allowance supplement. As honourable senators would be aware, the Government introduced the family package last year. Currently, it provides financial assistance of up to $22 a week per child to low income families where the children are below the age of 13 years and $28 a week for teenage children. Those payments are available to working families. They are an innovation in the social security system in that the money goes essentially to families whose head is in the work force rather than whose head may be dependent on social security. Those payments are available to families whose head is earning $300 a week or less. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that this Budget provides for significant increases in the family allowance supplement. That supplement is in the front line of Labor's attack on poverty. There is no doubt, from research on poverty in the Australian economy, that there is a very high incidence of poverty in families with children and in larger families. The family allowance supplement is targeted at children. Therefore, it is in the front line of the attack by the Hawke Government on the scourge of poverty in the Australian economy. It is very important to note that, while a $300 a week income limit applies for the basic payment, some family allowance supplement is available to families having much higher incomes. In fact, a three-child family on an income of up to $24,000 a year can receive part of a supplement. So the family allowance supplement is paid when there is a quite significant income. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget, importantly, provides for an increase in the family allowance supplement from 29 December next. For younger children the $22 a week will be replaced by an amount significantly higher-that is, $24 a week. For children aged from 13 to 15 years, the current $28 becomes $31 a week. It is important to note that that payment is essentially tax-free. It is outside the taxation system. So its equivalent in terms of corresponding wage rises is very large. In other words, a very large wage rise would be required to produce the same impact on disposable income-that is, after-tax income-as the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been provided with information that suggests that at present some 140,000 low income Australian families, which include over 340,000 children, are benefiting from the family allowance supplement. As I said earlier, essentially the supplement is going to families whose head is in the work force, therefore differentiating it from other sorts of family payments. I would certainly urge families who may be wondering about their entitlements to make sure they check with the local Department of Social Security office as soon as possible to determine their eligibility for this very important payment. I have estimated that in my own State of South Australia, where there are some 13,000 families receiving the supplement, with 32,000 children, the payment is not only attacking poverty but also, on the most conservative assumptions, adding about $32m per annum-that is in one State-to retail spending. So it is a very big boost in two directions-both in attacking poverty and in enabling families to raise their spending power, therefore boosting retail spending in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Commonwealth has provided a pensioner rebate of $250 to ensure that those who are wholly or mainly reliant on the pension do not pay income tax. I am pleased that in the 1988 Budget, the one we are now debating, the pensioner rebate rises from the present $250 to $430. The result of this will be that many more Australian pensioners will be exempt from personal income tax in the current financial year. The fact is that formerly, up to 30 June last, the annual amount of pensioner tax free income was $6,142. As a result of the increase in the pensioner rebate, that amount of tax exempt income will rise from $6,142 to $6,892. It is quite a significant amount of tax free income when one considers that members of the work force, employed members of the community, have a tax exempt income of $5,100. It represents a very significant rise in the tax exempt status of income earned by pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The pensioner rebate is also a very highly equitable measure, one that should be supported as it helps lower income pensioners most and then shades out on higher incomes so that those who are in less needy circumstances do not get the same benefit from it as those on the lowest incomes. In addition to the increase in the amount of tax free income, the levels of income at which the rebate shades out have been increased enormously. While the full rebate of tax will be available on incomes of up to $6,892, part rebates will be available on incomes of up to $10,330, which are significant retirement incomes in the present circumstances in the Australian community. So pensioners can now have incomes, including the pension and investment income in the form of savings bank interest perhaps, up to $10,330 and still get some benefit from the pensioner rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, the Government in this Budget has further examined the circumstances of Australia's pensioners and has relaxed requirements for the payment of provisional income tax. In this financial year if pensioners qualify for a part pensioner rebate-that is, if they have incomes up to $10,330-they will not be liable for the payment of personal income tax on a provisional basis. They are very significant improvements in the position of pensioners under the Hawke Government during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Next month the Budget will enable a further increase in the basic rates of pensions to occur to compensate age pensioners and other pensioners for cost of living rises. On my personal calculation-I am not claiming this as the official one-there will be a 3.5 per cent rise in pensions next month based on the increase in the consumer price index in the March and June quarters of this year. This suggests that the standard pension of $120.05 a week should rise from December by $4.20 a week to $124.25. The combined rate of pension, which is currently $200.10 a week, should rise by around $7 weekly to $207.10 a week. I believe that those increases will help pensioners to better keep up with cost of living rises in the Australian community. As a result of those rises, the age pension will come in at around 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That compares with the figure in the last year when Mr Howard was Treasurer, when pensions approximated 22.7 per cent of average wages. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are discussing the 1988 Budget I want to delve very briefly into history and look at the 1987 Budget and particularly at Mr Howard's reply to the speech of the Treasurer last year. It is very interesting to look at some of Mr Howard's claims. I made the point earlier that it is very important to check the claims of conservative politicians-what they said in the past and how they tally with the future. It is particularly interesting to note that on 17 September last year Mr Howard, in his reply to Mr Keating's Budget, said, for example, that the unemployment forecasts in the Budget were wrong and that unemployment had `stalled at 8 per cent or more'. But the reality is that unemployment in Australia is not stuck on 8 per cent; in fact, in the last month for which we have data-October this year-unemployment was not even 7 per cent; it was 6.9 per cent. That is a very tangible case of somebody who claims economic confidence-Mr Howard, the present Leader of the Opposition-being totally wrong. In the same speech on 17 September last year he also described the Government as `fiscal fools'. How can he say that this Government is a group of `fiscal fools' when it is only the second government in many years in the history of Australia to record a Budget surplus? The Budget surplus last financial year was only the second one in the last 35 years. So a couple of Mr Howard's claims can be totally disproven by history, which exposes his lack of competence on economic matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government recognises the challenge to Australia's future and through the Budget has responded appropriately by creating the right macro-economic environment in which industries can flourish. In the last 12 months the Government has achieved a Budget surplus, stabilised the exchange rate, continued employment growth policies and continued to focus assistance on the needy. However, governments alone cannot restructure the Australian economy. We need a collective effort from all sectors of the community to build a prosperous economy and society in the next century. </PARA>

<PARA> On behalf of the Australian Democrats I take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Senate to some issues of relevance to the future of agriculture in this country, particularly in the context of the passage of Budget and appropriations legislation. I refer particularly to what the Australian Democrats believe is the increasing recognition that agriculture needs to be sustainable in the long term-a recognition which is penetrating quite significantly the minds of decision-makers and particularly those who are concerned about the long term ability of our basic resource, the land, to sustain agriculture. With this comes the need for research and funding efforts to be directed towards ensuring agricultural sustainability. I have in the past and will no doubt in the future refer to a report entitled Our Common Future, from the World Commission on Environment and Development. I believe that this book puts this point quite well when it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The ability to choose policy paths that are sustainable requires that the ecological dimensions of policy be considered at the same time as the economic, trade, energy, agricultural, industrial, and other dimensions-on the same agendas and in the same national and international institutions. That is the chief institutional challenge of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . environmental stresses and patterns of economic development are linked to one another. Thus agricultural policies may lie at the root of land, water, and forest degradation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is in the context of these views, with which I wholeheartedly agree, that I believe the Federal Government needs to make a concerted effort to direct its agricultural policies and funding programs towards measures which reflect a commitment to ecologically and economically sustainable agriculture. One definition of sustainable agriculture is provided by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Australia (Ltd) (NASAA) and is provided in the 1987 publication entitled Sustainable Agriculture: A Viable Alternative. The authors, Els Wynen, an agricultural economist, and Sandy Fritz, who holds a degree in agriculture, present the definition as adopted by the constitution of NASAA, which I shall read:</PARA>
<PARA>A system of agriculture able to balance productivity with low vulnerability to problems such as pest infestation and environment degradation while maintaining the quality of land for future generations. In practice this involves a system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetically compounded fertilisers, pesticides, growth regulators, livestock feed additives and other harmful or potentially harmful substances. It includes the use of technologies such as rotations, mechanical cultivation and biological pest crop control; and such materials as legumes, crop residues, animal manures, green manures, other organic wastes and mineral bearing rocks. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now spend a few minutes highlighting the major issues discussed in this very valuable book, which is the first in a series of discussion papers to be published by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture in order, and I quote from the Association's publication, to `stimulate the exchange of ideas and information regarding issues of importance in the field of sustainable agriculture'. In the first instance the book deals with the conventional agricultural production system and issues such as pests, pesticides and pesticides resistance, soil, human health, fertilisers, pesticides and their short and long term effects, feed additives and environmental issues. The book then goes on to deal with these issues as they are related to sustainable agriculture. A comparison of conventional and sustainable farming systems is then addressed, with particular reference to quantity and quality of farm products. A review of the financial aspects of the two farming systems is then undertaken, including the costs of variable inputs such as fertilisers, manures, feed, pesticides, credit and fuel; the fixed inputs of machinery and labour; and the issues of information, research and extension. </PARA>
<PARA> A more detailed comparison of the economics of sustainable and conventional agriculture in south-eastern Australia is presented by Els Wynen, one of the authors of the book which I have referred to, in a La Trobe University School of Economics discussion paper, No. 22/88, published in August this year. She concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the results from the survey indicate that net private financial benefits from sustainable farming were similar to those in the conventional sector in certain areas in 1985-86. This was the case despite that year's relative output prices which were unfavourable for sustainable farmers, despite lack of information about the sustainable management system, and despite the fact that some conventional farmers were likely to be better managers than their sustainable counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA>Returning to the book by Wynen and Fritz, chapters 4 and 6 address government policies and different aspects of such policies on conventional and sustainable farming; farmers who have adopted sustainable agricultural practices, both in Australia and internationally; and initiatives in the international sustainable agriculture movement, including activities related to research, extension and education, marketing, and policy development. In their final chapter the authors make a number of concluding comments which I will set out briefly. They say, in answer to the question they pose of whether there is a role for government in encouraging this method of agriculture:</PARA>
<PARA>In spite of the viability of some sustainable producers, sustainable farming has not been adopted widely. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the difficulties during the transition period (low initial yields; high input prices (especially for machinery); no premium prices for produce); difficulties in obtaining information about production possibilities; competition with conventional producers who receive preferential treatment in the form of subsidies; restrictive marketing legislation and regulations; and social unacceptability. All these factors decrease the likelihood of farmers transferring from conventional to sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a role for government in removing some of these obstacles. However, government involvement need not necessarily be in the form of financial assistance. Increased information about aspects of sustainable systems of farming could be obtained by a redirection of existing research and extension facilities. Equal subsidisation of producers of the different systems would require a change of policies, but not necessarily increased financial assistance. Similarly, changes in marketing regulations do not necessarily imply increased costs to the government, although the establishment and enforcement of standards for sustainable produce might need funding in the early stages. A positive encouragement of sustainable production may require financial assistance in the transition period. </PARA>
<PARA>If we read, as I do, the vast volume of material now available on sustainable agriculture systems, we see that one issue keeps reappearing-the need for governments to achieve some semblance of balance in the allocation of research funding for conventional and sustainable farming systems and to undertake a redirection of existing research and extension facilities so as to provide much needed information for farmers. Sadly, these are areas where Australia is lagging behind other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Some initiatives elsewhere include the following-a five-year research program into sustainable agriculture by the Canadian Ministry of Agriculture; comparative studies of conventional and alternative agriculture by education and research stations of the Austrian Government; similar studies by the Swiss Government through its federal agricultural research station and the Research Institute of Biological Agriculture; the financing of a study on organic farming in England and Wales by the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture; a 1983 study of biological agriculture by the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and a more recent promotion of organic agriculture by the New Zealand Government. Various studies on different aspects of sustainable agricultural practices have also been carried out in the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands and West Germany, with Denmark and the Netherlands providing government extension offices specifically on sustainable agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Education in sustainable agriculture is also carried out in a number of countries, with the United States now offering degree programs in sustainable agriculture in a number of States. The inclusion of the alternative farming systems information centre as part of the National Agricultural Library to assist farmers wanting to convert from conventional to sustainable systems is another United States initiative, as was the establishment of a chair in sustainable agriculture at the university of Minnesota in 1986. Similar programs and courses in Canadian and New Zealand universities also exist and departments of ecological agriculture and alternative agriculture exist in the Netherlands and West Germany. This is not an exhaustive list. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, down under, the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture has twice had its marketing submission to the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Committee knocked back. Last year the Special Rural Research Council rejected NASAA's submission for meagre funding for its information clearing-house proposal. I sincerely hope that it will be successful in submissions this year, because one of the key issues as outlined by Wynen and Fritz in their publication is the ability to provide information to all farmers so that they can make a real choice between the systems of agriculture that they might wish to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the long but by no means exhaustive list which I have been able to mention here today of interest and action in this area overseas, I think Australia as a primary industry export nation would be less than sensible if it took no notice and did not begin to turn around the approach so that when these moneys are being spent in these Department of Primary Industries and Energy areas, at least a reasonable proportion is allocated in response to submissions from groups like NASAA or from individuals who are showing that they wish to be innovative and responsive to the needs of both the resource base upon which they are dependent for their livelihood and of the community which is increasingly suggesting that it wants to be sure that the food it is buying is safe and clean and that this Government does give due attention and due resources and funding to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a couple of initiatives. First of all, I draw attention to an initiative under the heading of high country beef which has been undertaken by a former Elders executive, Ron O'Dwyer. This very frustrated man came to see me some weeks ago in my Melbourne office. Although Ron O'Dwyer comes from a beef producing background, he is not just a simple farmer who is trying to break into something new. As I say, he is a former Elders executive and marketing man of proven competence who has been in the meat industry throughout his professional career. His marketing expertise as well as his own consciousness of progress have led to the establishment of the high country beef project. In an article in, encouragingly, the epicure section of the Melbourne Age of 1 November, Mr O'Dwyer is quoted as saying that his long career in meat marketing has left him with a troubled conscience because he believes it is time that Australian consumers knew that their thick, tender steak may be no more natural than Olympic athlete Ben Johnson's thigh muscles. He is quoted in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm a marketer, and I look for opportunities, but morally, what we were doing in the industry was wrong. Why are we introducing artificial growth promotants? It all comes back to the bottom line, which is profit. </PARA>
<PARA>This man is in this industry for perfectly sound economic reasons, overlaid with a consciousness of the fact that consumers are looking for a particular product. Ron O'Dwyer has gone to great lengths to persuade producers in the high country of the north-east of Victoria to use a private sector firm to test their properties. The producers, who have joined together and are organised, are meeting enormous resistence. The article puts it this way:</PARA>
<PARA>High country beef is provoking considerable tension. </PARA>
<PARA>It is suggested that one of the problems is that the issue of growth promotants should be kept quiet. Ron O'Dwyer is drawing attention to something which the conventional producers and, more particularly, the large meat organisations do not want attention drawn to. That, of course, flies in the face of what I and the Australian Democrats believe is everyone's right-the right to information and the right to choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Ron O'Dwyer has not gathered around him a whole lot of hippy dropouts. He is working in the north-east with third generation beef producers, who one would believe, on the surface and at face value, would be among the most conservative of rural people. But they can see, as he can see, that it is good business to provide for what is a community need and a community wish for a particular product. Yet there needs to be some sort of backup for the marketing proposal if this project is to proceed beyond a small chain of city butchers who have taken the product up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation annual report, which we addressed in this chamber some weeks ago, made great note of the innovative marketing programs which the Corporation supported. Well, it is not supporting this one. If this enterprise of an individual and a group of producers is not supported, quite clearly the larger operations in the meat industry will be able to come in and overpower them. The Democrats strongly suggest that it is this kind of exercise, which also has enormous export potential, that ought to be supported by government and industry programs. We plead with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to look seriously at these sorts of projects, of which this is but one. As I have already said, Mr O'Dwyer brings a particular expertise to the sustainable agriculture movement, if I might call it that. He brings the expertise of big business and entrepreneurial marketing. I hope that he will persist, as many others in the sustainable agriculture movement have persisted over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in yesterday's Australian headed `Nature's way stops whining about pests' contains another example of persistence. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> An Australian wine-maker is cashing in on vast new international markets created by consumer resistance to chemical additives in food production. </PARA>
<PARA>These words appeared in the Australian. The article is not something that was written by some nut. It was not written by an Australian Democrat, although we have said often enough that vast new international markets are available and have urged this Parliament and the Government to do what they can to ensure that Australia participates in those markets and that we are not locked out of them because of the foresight shown by our competitors in international agricultural marketing. As I said, New Zealand is doing a great deal in the field of organic agriculture. The same can be said of the United States and some European countries. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gil Wahlquist, of Botolobar Wines in NSW's Mudgee district, has become Australia's first recognised organic wine-maker, a status that is earning him access to lucrative markets at home and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that Mr Wahlquist really had no need to export. Apparently a British wine wholesaler heard about his efforts and requested samples of his wine which carry the Botolobar label. I am sure that this New South Wales town will become famous as Mr Wahlquist's wines do. Mr Wahlquist is now exporting to that British wholesaler although, as I said, he does not need to because his product could be totally sold at the cellar door. The article points out:</PARA>
<PARA> The grapes are grown without the use of chemical fertilisers or insecticides and his wines are bottled with no preservatives or drastically reduced amounts. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very good story of the sort of process which Wynen and Fritz outlined in the book from which I have quoted. The article states that when Mr Wahlquist and his wife first began planting vines:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . idealism had to come to terms with problems created by his early attempts to wean his land off insecticides. </PARA>
<PARA> He refused to spray his vines with DDT . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, all farmers do that now, but this was back in 1971. The article points out that the caterpillars came because there were no predators as a result of the DDT killing birds. Mr Wahlquist then grew controlled weeds underneath the vines to harbour insects on which the birds could feed. He found that the birds came but they attacked the grapes because they were so nice and juicy. He then provided water tubs from which the birds could drink. He has now developed a balance and is successful, as the article shows. I think the following statement by Mr Wahlquist is the most important quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> If you are going to plant something, you have to evaluate the total environment because you are really invading it. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly is a fundamental approach. He said that he and his wife were considered ratbags in the district and there are some people in this Parliament who would have been the first to call them ratbags, but he also said that they encouraged other local farmers to stop using herbicide sprays. Of course, one has to do this if one wants to get into this sort of production because, as many Australians have learned to their sorrow, fences and boundaries do not stop chemicals. It is also interesting to note his comment:</PARA>
<PARA> The old farmers who have been brought up in the days before pesticides supported us . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am reminded of my early childhood on a farm where really the only chemical that was used was superphosphate as a fertiliser. In my later years my father got interested in the new-fangled things that young farmers around him were using. He died at the age of 57 from a very strange disease, as did our neighbour, who was 20 years younger. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, a British wine wholesaler heard about the wines and Mr Wahlquist became a very successful exporter. I suggest that lots of other people could follow that example. Mr Wahlquist's organic growing methods have been officially recognised by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture in Australia, about which I spoke earlier. Those are just two examples. My files are full of other examples of people in Australia who are using these growing methods. However, the problem in Australia, as I have said, is that there is very little information on alternative methods of agriculture disseminated by governments and their extension offices to farmers. That is really a very unjust situation. We all pay for government extension, we all pay for government research funds through our taxes, and sustainable agricultural practitioners no less than anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> The current review of agricultural chemicals legislation in Victoria in recommending that `research efforts into alternative non-chemical methods of pest control are required' falls short of taking the crucial step of actually conveying this kind of information to those who need it, that is, the farmers. NASAA has suggested to the review that it adopt the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Results from research into alternative non-chemical methods of pest control will be communicated to farmers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Governments must make a commitment to that communication. Governments must face the challenges ahead and take action now to support people like this by implementing policies which are ecologically alert and taking the lead. </PARA>
<PARA> In Question Time today Senator Cook made the strong claim that this is the most environmentally conscious Australian government in history, or words to that effect, and he congratulated his fellow Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), and generally gave the Government quite a good pat on the back for its record in this area. I suggest that there is a long way to go. However, I also give credit where credit is due. I believe that governments at all levels in Australia, like people all over Australia, are beginning to realise that we will not have too much of a future unless we take care of our resource base and recognise, as does Mr Wahlquist, that if one is going to plant something one must evaluate the total environment because one is invading it. We are beginning to realise that in some of the more dramatic areas such as the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect, but we in Australia must never forget our very vulnerable soil resource base. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Democrats concur with the view put forward in that report from the World Commission on Environment and Development, the book called Our Common Future, that:</PARA>
<PARA>The ability to choose policy paths that are sustainable-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words the ability to anticipate and prevent environmental damage-</PARA>
<PARA>requires that the ecological dimensions of policy be considered at the same time as the economic, trade, energy, agricultural, industrial, and other dimensions-on the same agendas and in the same national and international institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>So these projects should receive funding in the same way as conventional agricultural projects should receive funding, support and information. For Australia's agriculture to be sustainable in the long term we need to set in train these kinds of policy principles right now. </PARA>

I will say something about each of those aspects in turn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have, I think, no great need to make a case for the evident fact that the Government's economic policies have failed. That is true whether one considers its macro-economic policies or its micro-economic policies. As to the Government's macro-economic policies, let us consider a few aspects and see how each of them measures up in terms of the test of success or failure. Let us take, first, that which we are debating today in any case, that is, the Budget. I suppose the Government could most convincingly or at least most plausibly claim to have been successful because the Government has, as Senator Maguire pointed out earlier, produced a Budget in surplus this financial year. I will not detract from that particular achievement as far as it goes because it is highly desirable that our Budget has been brought back into balance and indeed into surplus. The only thing that is wrong with that outcome is the process by which it has been achieved-the process whereby we have seen a major series of both new taxes and tax increases and where the Budget this financial year contains estimates of taxation revenues which again, I think for the third year running, are estimated to run at a record level of gross domestic product. That is on the basis of the estimates in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all the preliminary evidence to date-and admittedly only three months of data is to hand-suggests that the revenue side of the Budget in particular will run in excess of the Estimates. Work produced by the Macquarie Bank, as reported in today's press, seems to confirm that view. If so, we are likely to find that this year that record ratio of taxation to domestic product will be even more a record than estimated in the Budget Papers. To quote just one figure from the Budget Papers, however, we see that the revenue to be derived from pay as you earn taxation is estimated by the Government itself to increase this year alone by 13.8 per cent, and I hazard the expectation that that already huge rate of growth of taxation garnered from ordinary wage and salary earners, will come out to be appreciably higher than 13.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the next test of macro-economic competence on the part of our present Administration. Where have interest rates moved under this Government? You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when the Budget was brought down the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in his speech that he expected the Budget surplus of $5.5 billion-it is probably more than that now-to produce `downward pressure on interest rates'. Those were the Treasurer's words. I think it was two days later when we received the first horrific balance of payments result for July, which had been delayed, ironically enough, by industrial disputes. We received a market shock and interest rates began rising two days after the Budget and, quite frankly, I think it is literally true to say that they have not stopped rising since. Of course, there was a new quantum jump about two weeks ago when the Treasurer, in response to a dorothy dix question in the House of Representatives, finally owned up that he and the Government had actually been seeking to tighten monetary policy and to raise interest rates for some time past-a fact which, if I may say, the Treasurer had been studiously denying in the preceding weeks. If time permits, I may have more to say about that failure of the Government in relation to interest rates. At the moment I merely point out that we have seen a failure of this Budget to produce in the Treasurer's words `downward pressure on interest rates'. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings us to the next indicator of success or failure in macro-economic policy terms, that is, the exchange rate. Of course, as a direct consequence of what has been happening to interest rates in the past nearly three months we have seen the exchange rate for the Australian dollar climbing, particularly against the United States dollar but more generally against foreign currencies. While I do not want to suggest that I see virtue in a particular exchange rate for the Australian dollar against a particular currency because that would be totally inconsistent with a flexible and deregulated financial system, I nevertheless think that when one sees our Australian dollar moving over a relatively short time-just a few weeks basically-from a rate of about 78c to the US dollar to a rate which, as of this morning, was about 86c to the US dollar, one has to ask: What possible justification can there be for a development of that kind in respect of the competitive situation of our exporters and, for that matter, our import competing producers who will be competing against, in Australian dollar terms, cheaper foreign products? One has to ask: Are our money wage costs rising less fast than those in the United States for example? Is our productivity performance superior to that of the United States? If either of those things were true, and of course if both of them were true, it would provide some justification for the fact that our dollar is strengthening against the United States dollar. But I am not aware that that is the case. I want to say a little more about productivity performance later to indicate that quite the reverse is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> If neither of those things is so, why is our dollar rising against the United States dollar? We all know the answer to that. It is because this Government has the mix of its economic policies wrong. It is now relying upon a credit squeeze, via higher interest rates forced upon the market by Reserve Bank of Australia action in the money markets, to do the work that the Government's Budget, brought down three months ago, has failed to do. On that test certainly the macro-economic policies of the Government have failed miserably.</PARA>
<PARA> But perhaps the most obvious area where that failure is apparent is in the balance of payments. The Treasurer, in what is now perhaps the most rapidly discredited forecast made by any Treasurer in this country's history, forecast on Budget night that we would have a $9.5 billion current account deficit on the balance of payments this financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer indicates, he must have meant six months. We have had a deficit of $5.4 billion in the first four months. While it is of course true-as has been remarked ad nauseam by Government senators and Government Ministers-that there is an element of seasonality in the balance of payments this year, even the Treasurer has now been forced to abandon that $9.5 billion forecast for the year as a whole. At this stage it is not clear what the Treasurer's new forecast is. There were some leaks in the press a few weeks ago that suggested that the Treasurer had now moved to a forecast of $10.5 billion for the year as a whole. But the Treasurer has conspicuously failed to confirm those revised, or indeed any other, forecasts. I point out in passing that to achieve a deficit even of $10.5 billion would require a deficit of not more than $638m a month for the last eight months of the year. To use understated language-unlike, if I might say so, some of the rather overblown rhetoric on the other side of the chamber-I do not think that that is likely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, during Question Time today in response to a question I asked him, said that he was sure that the balance of payments deficit this year would be less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). If one thinks about it, Senator Walsh was saying that, using an estimate of GDP as laid down at the time of the Budget, the balance of payments deficit would be less than $12.8 billion-not $9.5 billion, not $10.5 billion, but less than $12.8 billion. Just for the record it is worth mentioning that this year GDP, in nominal terms, will be almost certainly higher than was forecast at the time of the Budget; so a deficit of 4 per cent of GDP would be even greater than $12.8 billion. That is now the mark against which the Government is measuring its performance. If it comes in under 4 per cent-under 13 point something or other billion dollars-the Government will tell us that it has been successful.</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of interest, if the Government is to do better this year than its abysmal performance last year of an $11.8 billion deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, the deficit will have to average less than $803m a month for the next eight months. The truth is that the balance of payments performance of this Government is not just a failure; it is a disaster. The high exchange rate which the Government's credit squeeze is now inducing will make that disaster worse. By definition it will render our import competing industries as well as our export industries less competitive. Of course, because of this disastrous balance of payments outcome, our foreign debt keeps on climbing. </PARA>
<PARA> We had some interesting statistics from Senator Maguire earlier this afternoon who told us how the Government is getting on top of the foreign debt position. He told us that on the basis of the figures for the end of June which, to be fair to Senator Maguire, are the latest figures we have. But he failed to mention that the improvement in the foreign debt figures he referred to is principally due to the revaluation effect on the stock of foreign debt brought about by the fact that during the June quarter in particular our exchange rate rose significantly. I will not be surprised if we see the same thing when we get the September quarter figures. The Government will no doubt again claim success in bringing our foreign debt position under control. All I can say is that if it keeps on bringing our foreign debt position under control by pushing up our exchange rate, shortly we will not have any exporters left in this country. I hope that we do not hear any more of that spurious stuff about how the Government is succeeding from Senator Maguire or anyone else on the other side of the chamber. Senator McKiernan at least is assuring me that he will not indulge in that kind of spurious rhetoric. I accept his assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now turn to the Government's prowess in its micro-economic policies in which there is a whole galaxy of failures, the most important one of which is its total failure even to tackle the micro-economic problem of the labour market by way of deregulation of the labour market. Senator Chaney, who has just come into the chamber, said something about that during the course of his earlier remarks. In that respect I join with him in his comments. We have also seen the Government's almost equally total failure in the area of deregulation of the market for traded goods. We have had extraordinarily limited progress in that area from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is much better at talking than acting-like most Ministers of this Government. The levelling of the playing field-to pick one of the Treasurer's favourite phrases when he talks about taxation policy-is notably absent from the area of deregulation of the market for traded goods, and notably absent from the area of putting our exporters on the same level playing field as our import competing industries. The result of both these failures, particularly the failure to tackle the problem of trade union power in its effect upon the operations of our labour market, has been to produce an abysmal productivity performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite by chance, last Thursday the Australian Bureau of Statistics put out a new publication which is highly relevant to that issue. It carries the very dull title of Australian National Accounts-Gross Product, Employment and Hours Worked. What the Statistician has done is to produce two series of figures for what, in technical jargon, he calls real gross domestic product per person employed and per hour worked. These figures are based on two separate bases for calculating gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into all the technicalities of it all, what do we find? Honourable senators will remember that over the first two years of the life of the present Government-that is, in 1983-84 and in 1984-85-the economy was recovering and coming up from the trough which had been created. To correct a point made earlier by one or two Government senators, that was created not by the previous Government but by the policies of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the 23 per cent increase in hourly wage rates forced upon the economy by the ACTU and a centralised wage determination system-a subject which, above all, the Government will not tackle-which created some 130,000 additional unemployed in the course of 12 months. Coming up from that trough, created by the Government's own supporters, the economy, under this Government in its first two years of office, registered an increase in gross domestic product per hour worked, on the more favourable of the two bases of estimation; in other words, choosing the best possible figures to make the Government's case. On that basis, we found over those two years a rise in gross domestic product per hour worked of 4.6 per cent-2.3 per cent per annum. One might say that in the past that has been about average for the Australian economy-and so it has been-but we are talking not about an average period but about a period of cyclical upswing and recovery, when one expects to get the best productivity performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the past three years, that is, 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88. We find that, on exactly the same basis, over those three years there has been a rise in gross domestic product per hour worked of 1.2 per cent-less than half of one per cent per annum. That is what the Commonwealth Statistician tells us about the productivity performance of this economy during the last three years under the Hawke Labor Government. According to the Treasurer, it was in those three years that the economy turned the corner. It has turned the corner so many times that we have become positively giddy in the process!</PARA>
<PARA> That is the record of this Government; the record of its failure. That is why our economy is uncompetitive. It is why our balance of payments deficit is blowing out yet again, despite all the rhetoric about the J-curve and all that stuff that the Treasurer went on with for at least 18 months before he started to get ambitions to become Prime Minister. Why do we have that failure? Principally it is because the Government has refused to face up to the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot from the Government about the accord between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I want to say here and now that that accord is a fraud. The whole record of boastful rhetoric from this Government on that subject is totally fraudulent. While I do not have time now to argue that case extensively, the truth of the proposition is evident from the bottom line, from the result. We have the result, which is that in the last three years, when the Government has been assisted by its mates in the trade union movement, we have had a rise in pro- ductivity of less than one half of one per cent per annum. That is the result of allowing industrial relations in this country to be controlled by the principal interest group involved, namely, the trade union leaders, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone were to suggest that this Government or any other government should allow our industrial structure to be controlled by a few great capitalist monopolists, there would be outrage. Yet we have the process of monopolistic control of the labour markets by a small group of trade union heavies, and that is regarded as being an eminently desirable outcome by this Government, which enshrines it in the fancy language of the accord. Of course, exactly the same story applies in the case of industrial protection where, as I said earlier, we have had progress at a snail's pace. I suppose that is not surprising in view of the history of the past 80-odd years in this country, with the lack of deregulation of the traded goods market, marching hand in hand with the lack of deregulation of the labour market-one supporting the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let us look at the prospects which confront the economy under the failed policies of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government-or perhaps I should reverse that and say the Keating-Hawke Labor Government. We are told that there is a prospect of major real tax cuts-not just giving back to people the $2 billion or so which bracket creep alone will take away from them in 1989-90 by way of increased taxes, but real tax cuts over and above that amount as from 1 July next year. In fact, by that time we will have had another balance of payments deficit of about the same as last year. Perhaps it will be a shade less, or perhaps, if Senator Walsh's worst fears are realised, it will be a shade more. As a result we will have incurred more foreign debt and have made more sales of Australian assets to foreigners, in both cases to pay for the fact that we continue to refuse to live within our means internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have had another year of high inflation. That is another area of failure which I have simply not had time to refer to. Let me simply say that the Treasurer's forecast of a 4.5 per cent consumer price index increase by the end of the June quarter of this financial year is now considered by the Treasurer himself to be the pie in the sky that it always was. We will have had another year of rotten productivity. Even the Budget Papers themselves forecast a productivity increase of only three-quarters of one per cent this year, although one would have to say that that would be a significant increase on the performance of the last three years. At the end of all that time-I might add, at a time when we will have had sustained high interest rates and a high exchange rate-we will have a major real tax cut. This will come just at a time, perhaps-although nobody can foresee these things with precision-when the world economy either is about to slow down or has already begun to slow down and the prospects for our export prices are beginning to fade. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Government is out of touch not only with the lives, hopes and aspirations of ordinary Australians-as Senator Chaney has indicated in foreshadowing his amendment-but also with economic reality. The Government's policies have been a failure. The only question is: Will it acknowledge that failure and, if so, how soon? To put that point another way, when is Mr Keating going to stop trying to supplant Mr Hawke as the Prime Minister of this country and get back to being the Treasurer?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate this afternoon is discussing a package of Appropriation Bills-the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2)-which were introduced into the Parliament recently and which essentially are the machinery provisions of the Budget which was delivered in August of this year. Before I begin my comments on these Appropriation Bills I want again to recognise a comment made by the previous speaker, Senator Stone, when he said that I do not engage in spurious rhetoric. I note that that comment was supported by Senator Puplick, but I realise that such support from diverging wings of the Opposition parties will still do me no good in the preselection battles that I may or may not have within my Party in the coming year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that interjection. In the debate tonight I will deal with some spurious rhetoric, and the spurious rhetoric I refer to is comments made by Senator Haines in her response to the Budget delivered in this chamber on 29 August. The general theme of Senator Haines's comments on that night was that it was not a Budget for families but was a Budget for beer drinkers. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget does nothing for families, for ordinary Australians . . . There is nothing in this Budget to give joy to low income families . . . There is nothing in this Budget to assist ordinary Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what motivated Senator Haines to make the comments she did on that night. We expect a lot better from Senator Haines, not only as the leader of an important political party in this chamber but also as senator. I find her comments completely and utterly irresponsible. Contrary to what was said on that night, I believe that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) should be commended for having achieved much more support than many of us would have thought possible for low income families, for ordinary Australians, in the Budget delivered in August. Far from criticising the Minister or the Budget in total, we should be commending him. I believe we should applaud his achievements in realising equity and fairness for all Australians and not just for the fortunate majority. If Senator Haines cannot find it in her heart to commend the Budget on the ground of its realising Labor's social justice goals, it is at least heartening that it received accolades from the likes of Julian Disney from the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) whose press release of 23 August said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of the measures (announced) are useful steps in highly desirable directions. </PARA>
<PARA>It further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> (ACOSS) greatly welcomes the Government's specific commitments to increase expenditure in (new employment and training programs) and other areas in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government's commitment to further improvement of the new child support scheme, expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme, improved funding for AIDS programs and expanded funding for preventative health. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if Senator Haines is unable to recognise the achievements of this year's Budget in achieving social justice objectives, it is interesting and welcoming to note that the likes of Mr Disney, who is not backward in saying his piece when he wants to criticise government initiatives, are prepared to commend the Government for its achievements in these important social policy areas. In my view it is proof of just how much this Budget attempts to achieve for Australian families, especially the disadvantaged families, those families in which the principal is either single and/or is a member of the ranks of the long term unemployed. The 1988-89 Budget will be remembered for the emphasis placed on assisting low income families, pensioners and other beneficiaries. This assistance reflects the Government's commitment to social justice issues and can be seen in many areas, including in the new start scheme; the new jobs, education and training, or JET, scheme; increases in the family allowance supplement; 40,000 additional higher education places by 1990, which is only just around the corner; a real increase of over 20 per cent for programs for Aboriginal advancement; a package of housing assistance measures to increase assistance to low income families; and the introduction of stage 2 of the child support scheme for July 1989. I go on: an increase of 30,000 in child care places over the next four years; the extension of the provision of non-institutional care for the frail aged and younger people with disabilities under the home and community care program by $40m; and the new extreme disablement adjustment to the general rate of the veteran pension. This means an extra $42.15 a week for those who are eligible. Likewise, the reduction of the disability requirement from 100 to 79 per cent for the totally and permanently incapacitated pension is an initiative that has been welcomed by many. </PARA>
<PARA> The sum total of these programs is a strengthening of the Government's commitment to its social justice program, reflected most clearly for me in the taking of positive steps to enable social security recipients to emerge from the poverty cycle which many of them have been submerged in for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of Senator Haines and other honourable senators I now intend to look more closely at some of the programs I have alluded to and at what the Government has done in specific program areas for low income Australian families. Funding for the family allowance supplement (FAS) will cost $69m this financial year. From December, maximum payments under FAS will be increased by approximately 10 per cent, by $2 a week to $24 for childen aged 12 years or under, and by $3 a week to $31 for children aged 13 to 15. These increases in FAS are in line with the Government's commitment to increase total child care payments until they reach 15 per cent of the combined married pensioners rate for younger children and 20 per cent of that rate for older children. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of stage 2 of the child support scheme was announced in the Budget, and will begin in July 1989. This will ensure that adequate financial resources are available for children whose parents' relationship has ended. Under the scheme a formula will be used to determine child maintenance amounts, in most cases replacing court based assessment of maintenance. The formula will be based on the income of the non-custodial parent, taking account of the needs of any other children who live with the parent, and the income of the custodial parent if it is higher than average weekly earnings, plus an allowance for work related child care. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the introduction of stage 2 of the scheme will make it easier for parents to resolve maintenance issues by removing the need to go to court to have an amount decided. It also means that we are moving closer to our goal of making all parents financially responsible for their children. As we heard earlier this year when stage 1 of the child support scheme was introduced, where parents have separated only 30 per cent of non-custodial parents choose to obey maintenance orders, which in most cases are totally inadequate anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> We should all be aware by now that the Government introduced two new employment programs in the Budget, JET and new start. The JET scheme recognises that many sole parents have few or inappropriate job skills and that they often feel that they face insurmountable barriers to work force re-entry. This program is therefore designed to help sole parent pensioners become economically independent by helping them gain the necessary skills to enter the work force, thereby lifting both themselves and their children out of the poverty cycle. The program is therefore a vital link in the Government's effort to eliminate child poverty by 1990, for a large percentage of the children living in sole parent families also live in poverty. For example, in 1981-82 the incidence of poverty for children in sole parent families was higher than for any other social group. Forty-six per cent of all sole parent families were living below the poverty line. If there were three children in the sole parent family, there was a 70 per cent chance that they were living below the poverty line. If there were four or more children in the family, the odds of their living below the poverty line increased to a massive 91 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has improved the situation for the vast majority of such families-indeed, all beneficiary families-in the 5 1/2 years it has been in office. I will use the Henderson poverty line and June 1988 prices as a benchmark to demonstrate this. I qualify what I say by accepting that there is some dispute about the validity of the Henderson poverty line. Nevertheless, I will use it as the basis of my argument this evening. In March 1983 a single beneficiary with no children was $23.40 below the poverty line. In June 1988 that single beneficiary would have been $1.30 above the poverty line. In March 1983 a sole parent beneficiary with one child was $23.60 below the accepted poverty line. In June of this year such a beneficiary was $11.20 above it. In March 1983 a single parent beneficiary with two children was $37.10 below the poverty line. In June 1988 that beneficiary was 50c above it. In March 1983 a beneficiary couple with one child was $4.10 above the poverty line. However, in June 1988 the couple was $30.95 above. A beneficiary couple with two children in March 1983 was $10.60 below the poverty line. In June 1988 such a couple was $20.15 above. In March 1983 a beneficiary couple with three children was $26.30 below the poverty line. In June 1988 that couple was $10.95 above. Pensioners with children aged between 13 years and 15 years will have fared even better since December last year because of the recognition by this Government of the increased costs borne by families with older children. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this Government has made major inroads into reducing the appalling statistics, it cannot be denied that sole parent families have become the new poor in our society. The jobs, education and training program is an attempt to alleviate the situation. It recognises the enormous barriers to labour market participation faced by many sole parents. More specifically, JET is to begin in March 1989 at a cost of $40m. It will offer the following services to sole parents: needs assessment, counselling, advice and assistance; improved income security through Austudy and the formal training allowance to be paid through the Department of Employment, Education and Training-the study allowance to sole parent beneficiaries to be doubled, to $30 a week; access to education and labour market programs; and child-care tailored to their education, training and employment choices, in recognition of the fact that lack of available child-care is one of the most severe barriers to work force re-entry faced by sole parents. It is estimated that about 12,000 child-care places will be provided under the program. </PARA>
<PARA> JET is aimed at three specific groups of sole parents: firstly, those who have been on a pension for more than one year and whose youngest child is at school; secondly, those whose youngest child is 14 years or over-eligibility for the sole parent pension ends when the youngest child turns 16 and such parents will be needing to join the work force in two years or less; and, thirdly, teenage sole parents. I make the comment that, contrary to the myth that has abounded in recent times, in 1986 only 2.4 per cent of female sole parents were teenagers. This number is declining. In the late 1970s this group made up 4.2 per cent of the sole parent population. I refer now to the New Start program, which will cost $114m over the next 3 1/2 years. Like the JET program, New Start is designed to help those people with chronic labour market disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to housing. Housing costs, particularly those in the private rental market, have long been recognised as a major cause of poverty. In this Budget the Government has taken further important steps, as an integral part of its commitment to eradicate child poverty, to increase assistance to low income families renting privately. We have injected $47m for rental assistance to low income families. From June 1989 maximum rental assistance to families who are pensioners, beneficiaries or on low incomes with one or more children will be increased by 33 per cent, or $5 per week, rising to a maximum of $30 per week by June 1990. These measures represent an increase of 150 per cent to 200 per cent in rent assistance for low income and pensioner beneficiary families since the election of the Labor Government in 1983. This will have a major effect on reducing housing related poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned Aboriginal affairs previously. In the context of the Budget debate and the Estimates committee hearings Aboriginal affairs have drawn the attention of the media. I will not canvass the specific matters that attracted that media attention, but I would make the point that in this year's Budget Government funding for Aboriginal programs has been increased by 23.6 per cent to $476m for a range of new measures in the areas of health, housing, education and employment. I welcome the attention that Aboriginal development programs are receiving from the media, but I do not welcome the particular attention they received on the most recent occasion. It would have been better if the media had focused on the fact that Aboriginal people in this nation receive only two-thirds of the national median income. Only 26 per cent of Aboriginal people own their own homes, compared with 70 per cent of all other Australians. An estimated 30 per cent of Aboriginals are unemployed, compared with the national average of 8 per cent. Only 2.5 per cent of employed Aboriginals own their own businesses, compared with 15 per cent of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a 1987 housing needs survey, there is an urgent need for 16,498 dwellings to accommodate Aboriginals living in substandard and overcrowded dwellings. The percentage of Aboriginal families living in substandard housing is four times the national average. It is a pity the press does not concentrate a little more on statistics such as those rather than on the inflammatory material that it dwelt on in the last month or so. In mentioning Aboriginals, I extend my congratulations to Minister Hand on his achievements in attaining the funding he has obtained in this year's Budget. In passing, I also comment that a lot of accusations have been made about the use of money in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Those accusations are being investigated. We on this side of the chamber will be looking very closely at the assertions and allegations that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that the Government is making provision for an extra 30,000 child-care places targeted to people with the greatest needs. The extra places will be made up of 20,000 out of school hours child-care places, 4,000 centre based, 4,000 family day care and 2,000 occasional care. The number of Government child-care places has been boosted in this Government's term in office from 46,000 to 110,000-which reinforces my opening comments tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also increased funding for country counselling and access services, particularly for families in rural areas-targeted specifically, again, at rural women who quite often are overlooked in such programs. Additional funding has also been granted to marriage counselling organisations. It has increased by 11 per cent. Marriage education funding has increased by 76 per cent. Higher education places will be the subject of further discussion later in this session of parliament. I mention in passing that we will increase the number of places available in our tertiary institutions by 40,000 over the next three years. We will deal with that in more detail later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the fairly brief time I have had tonight I have sought to highlight some of the important aspects of the accountability of the Government's social justice strategy. I have sought to provide proof that economic responsibility and social responsibility are not contradictory goals. With great pleasure I support the Bills before the chamber. I do so because of what the Budget contains for families. Senator Haines could not be more mistaken than to say that it ignores the family. The Budget goes to the very heart of social justice. It is a Budget genuinely concerned with fairness and support for the disadvantaged in our community. While the Government has pursued sound economic policy and structural adjustment, it has not done so without continual recognition of the need to pursue simultaneously a social justice strategy. This Government does not believe, as the previous Fraser Government did, that social justice is something that should be suspended while we get the economy right. Once again, I ask that we all adopt an holistic approach to social issues and realise once and for all that aid directed to the less fortunate members of our community is to the ultimate benefit of us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support very strongly the amendment to the motion that Appropriation Bill (No. 1) be now read a second time foreshadowed by my colleague and Leader, Senator Chaney. For those who may not have heard what the amendment contains, let me summarise it briefly. It draws attention to this country's stagnant productivity, high inflation, continuing balance of payments, or deficit, crisis and rising interest rates which are hurting business and home buyers alike. It also draws attention to the squalor of this Government's management of certain departments, particularly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills authorise the Government's expenditures for the current financial year. Yesterday in the Senate the Government put down, two months early, a report on the Forward Estimates for the next three years. I will come back to that a little later. Firstly, let us acknowledge that the expenditures set down in the Bills are the core of the Government's economic policies. Its expenditure determines the size of the tax burden on the Australian people, the moneys it needs to borrow to carry on its affairs, as well as the broad impact on the economic welfare of the Australian people. This is the Government in action, determining its own economic, fiscal and political priorities. It is this matter that I want to emphasise today. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable senators remember that when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought down the Budget a little over two months ago he proclaimed, `This is the one that brings home the bacon'? The clear inference from that was that the tax cuts mooted therein were to be the centrepiece of the Government's strategy leading up to the 1989 election. Of course, the tax cuts were not to start until next year and would be there only if Australians sat up straight and took their medicine properly this year. The kind of medicine we had to take this year involved paying more taxes to the tune of about $5,700m over and above what might have been expected. That works out at a little over $1,000 a year, or $20 a week, per family in Australia. The next point was not spelt out but it involved higher interest rates-on our mortgages, farm loans, business loans and even our consumer purchases when we bought things on Bankcard or any other kind of credit facility. Those are the costs to the Australian people of not getting tax cuts now but, rather, having to wait until it suits the Hawke-Keating Government's electoral priorities next year. </PARA>
<PARA> What this all means is that the average Australian family has lost, in real spending power, $56 per week since this Government came to power. The average family is $56 per week down the drain. The point about this is that it takes place under the Hawke-Keating Government's political strategy. It is not a strategy to help the Australian people; it is not a strategy to restore living standards for the Australian people: it is a strategy to get the Hawke-Keating Government re-elected at the end of 1989. We have to pay now so that Mr Keating can hand back to us in the election year the money that he has stealthily syphoned off through bracket creep in this financial year. That was the strategy. It was closely aligned to the Treasurer's personal political agenda-to knock off Bob Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess he will. The whole idea was this: having grabbed the crown from the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, he would survive for a few months as Prime Minister of this country, take it to an election in 1989 and then hand back to us the very taxes that he had ripped off us during the immediately preceding year. A row has already started in the Australian Labor Party (ALP) as its members choose sides between Keating and Hawke. Quite obviously, it is a very divisive issue. That was the game plan. The ALP was to set itself up and be ready, to get its chariot polished, all the shields ready and all the spears sharpened so that it could get the cart out, move out of the arena and into the financial year with Keating as Prime Minister and the tax cuts yet to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Suddenly, the wheels fell off the cart, because in September we started to get some bad economic statistics-not that they surprised anybody. Anybody who was at least informed about this country's financial situation realised that there were a lot of question marks hanging over the Budget that was brought down in August. Quite clearly, the Government has overestimated its capacity to keep inflation down. As we have already seen, it reached over 2 per cent in the last quarter, compared with a Government estimate that would have had to be of the order of one per cent to reach the target as set down in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Also, we saw the collapse of the balance of payments in each of the first three months of this financial year. In September there was a $1.7 billion blow-out in the balance of payments. I believe that that is quite an understatement of the real position facing this country. The last three months demonstrate clearly that a hugh problem faces this country in terms of our exports, how we handle our imports and what will happen in the months ahead as we must continue to keep the debt that we owe the rest of the world on the downward path rather than the upward path. Every month we add about $1 billion or $1 1/2 billion to the debt that we owe the rest of the world. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a statement relating to the joint defence facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar, to move that the Senate take note of the statement and to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform the Senate that the Australian and US Governments have agreed to a number of important changes to the arrangements under which we cooperate in running our joint defence facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes we are making reflect the commitment of both Governments to maintaining and strengthening our long-standing partnership in these joint facilities. They ensure that the facilities continue to operate in ways that best serve the interests of ourselves and our partners. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes also reflect the commitment of this Government to informing the public as fully as possible about the facilities. On 6 June 1984 in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister made the first detailed public statement about the roles of the facilities. In making that statement he was convinced that better public understanding of the roles of the joint facilities could only increase public support for them. These remarks today, which will in some respects go beyond that earlier statement, are made with the same conviction. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the joint facilities were established in the 1960s, the alliance between Australia and the US has evolved and matured, the technologies involved at Pine Gap and Nurrungar have developed, and Australians have learned more of the skills involved in running the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements at Pine Gap and Nurrungar accommodate these important changes. </PARA>
<PARA> At Pine Gap, the number of Australians engaged in the central operational activity is being steadily increased. Some of these personnel, who are drawn from scientific and intelligence areas of the Department of Defence, are taking over functions previously carried out by US employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas only a handful of Australian Government personnel was directly involved in the central work of the facility in the 1970s and early 1980s-contributing less than 10 per cent of the staff there-the proportion is scheduled to rise to about 30% over the next two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA> But Australians are not only doing more of the operational work at the facilities. Under the new arrangements we have agreed, Australians will carry out more of the senior management functions at both Pine Gap and Nurrungar. </PARA>
<PARA> At Pine Gap, a senior Australian Defence official will be appointed to a newly created position as Deputy Chief of the Facility. He will advise and support the US Chief of Facility in managing the facility and its activities, and he will share responsibility with him for that work. He will also continue to be the officer in charge of the prohibited area, with ultimate responsibility for the physical security of the facility. Other senior management positions will also be filled by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Parallel changes have been agreed to the staffing at Nurrungar. Australians constitute some 40 per cent of the staff in the key operational areas, and will now take a role in management with the appointment of the senior Australian officer there as Deputy Commander. Like his counterpart at Pine Gap, he will share responsibility with the Commander for the management of the station and its physical security. </PARA>
<PARA> The integration of Australian personnel in both the operation and the management of the joint facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar is such that the Australian Government can be assured of having full knowledge of all aspects of the operations at the facilities, and reinforces our confidence that our interests and sovereignty are respected at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, Australia will be able to take more direct advantage of the facilities' capabilities for our own purposes than has been practicable in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Hitherto, by agreement between ourselves and our partners, we have spoken in public of the capabilities of the two facilities only in conjunction. Under the new arrangements and in pursuit of better understanding and stronger support for the facilities we have now agreed to specify the separate roles of Pine Gap and Nurrungar. </PARA>
<PARA> Nurrungar is a ground station used for controlling satellites in the United States Defence Support Program (DSP). The DSP satellites provide ballistic missile early warning and other information related to missile launches, surveillance and the detonation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Few if any elements of the strategic systems of either superpower make such a decisive and unambiguous contribution to keeping the peace as the Defence Support Program. As an essential link in the DSP, Nurrungar plays a quite fundamental role in preventing nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA> The DSP, through Nurrungar, would give the earliest warning of an ICBM attack on the United States or its allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the DSP gives longer warning of an attack than other systems, it reduces the chances that United States forces could be destroyed in a surprise attack, and that makes it extremely unlikely that anyone would ever try such an attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with other elements of the United States early warning system, the DSP provides highly reliable warning of attack. It thus plays a vital role in helping to prevent nuclear war by accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians can be glad that we help to operate this vital facility, and that every day, around the clock, Australian personnel are playing this part in helping to prevent nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Pine Gap. Pine Gap is a satellite ground station, whose function is to collect intelligence data which supports the national security of both Australia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes importantly to the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. The value of that data has become more and more evident over the last year or two, as disarmament has moved from being an aspiration to become an emerging reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, for the first time since the invention of the atom bomb, nuclear weapons systems are, under the INF Treaty, being destroyed by their owners. The next step is already underway. In the START talks the superpowers are seriously negotiating to make major cuts in their strategic arsenals. </PARA>
<PARA> Verification is vital to this arms control process. Verification was the key issue in reaching that INF agreement last year, and verification will be the key to any START agreement in the future. If the START process were to fail, despite the efforts of both sides, it would be largely because of the difficulties with verification. </PARA>
<PARA> In April this year, nuclear risk reduction centres were created in Washington and Moscow. This new confidence building channel is being used to notify the two sides of missile launches required by arms control accords and will also serve to reduce the possibility of nuclear conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Without Australia's involvement in arms control verification, the risk of nuclear war would have been directly and significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for those who have urged us over the years to close Pine Gap and Nurrungar to reflect on the undoubted fact that, had we done as they urged, the INF Treaty could not have been signed and the START process would not have got underway. </PARA>
<PARA> With the information now on the public record about the roles played by these facilities in preventing nuclear war, I think it is clear that nobody seriously committed to peace could argue for their closure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are of course limitations on what it would be sensible for me to reveal publicly about details of the operations that are conducted at either of these joint defence facilities, or details of the organisation and manning arrangements which apply there. It has been the practice of successive Australian Governments not to comment on intelligence matters, and this Government will continue that policy. Details of our capabilities in the sensitive and important area of intelligence collection, or in relation to systems providing attack warning, are not in our national interests to divulge and this Government will not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes the view that the irreplaceable contribution made by these facilities gives us a special responsibility to ensure that they can continue to function in an atmosphere of stability and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> At present both facilities operate under agreements which are terminable at one year's notice by either side. We do not regard this as satisfactory, both because of the continuing importance of their effective operation to global peace, and because of the specific benefits to Australia of long-term access to their capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the US and Australia have, as part of the new arrangements for the operation of the facilities, agreed to extend the arrangements under which the two facilities operate for a further ten years in each case. We have further agreed that three years' notice shall be required to terminate the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, and the US Ambassador, Mr Bill Lane, signed exchanges of notes to formalise this agreement. For the information of Honourable Senators I now table those exchanges of notes. Senators will note that this exchange also defines clearly the functions of the two facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> These agreements confirm the Government's conviction that the joint defence facilities will continue to serve Australia's national interests; that they will continue to reflect the depth and substance of our bilateral strategic relationship with the United States under ANZUS; and that they will continue to play a vital role in preventing nuclear war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the statement presented yesterday in the House of Representatives and presented in the Senate tonight by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in relation to the joint facilities operated by Australia and the United States in Australia. It is very hard to overemphasise the importance of these facilities for the peace and security not only of this nation but of the world. That point is made very strongly in the statement presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) yesterday and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade tonight. I quote just one paragraph of the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important for those who have urged us over the years to close Pine Gap and Nurrungar to reflect on the undoubted fact that, had we done as they urged, the INF treaty could not have been signed and the START process would not have got underway. </PARA>
<PARA>In other parts of the statement note is made of the fact that these facilities on Australian soil contribute greatly to the world peace and its maintenance. They do that in one broad way in so far as they provide intelligence as to what is going on in relation to missile launchings for test purposes, for developmental purposes and, of course, in the event of an all-out nuclear attack. They provide for a warning that missiles have been launched. It is always assumed that they would be launched against the United States. That is a reasonable assumption, though it is not always a certainty that the United States would be the target in an attack. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great function that these bases have is the function of verification, of being able to keep tabs on what the Soviets are up to and see that they are abiding by various arms control agreements that have been developed over the years and progressively will be developed in the future. The other point that needs to be emphasised about these facilities is that they are absolutely essential for the verification process. They cannot be sited in the United States, South America or Europe. To meet the particular forms of verification that we need for Soviet surveillance, they simply have to be in the current site. Australia for many years now has hosted those facilities. We have done that on a mutual basis, and we have all benefited as a consequence because we have maintained peace for nearly 45 years in a nuclear age-something that, if we were to listen to the more extreme members of some groups in the community, we would think was quite impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to dwell on the process of verification for a moment because verification is at the very heart of any arms control agreement. One side has to know that the other side is conforming precisely to whatever arms reductions or arms limitation agreement is in place. A very great stumbling block with nuclear weapons, given their relatively small size, ease of concealment, mobility and the way they can be deployed in many sites, has been the process of verification. The joint facilities in Australia have played a major role in one element of verification. In the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty we have seen a whole new world open up in on-site inspection. This is something that some of us who have been involved in arms negotiation agreements and have followed them over many years never thought would happen, but now we have Soviet teams actually in American bases looking at the missiles that are deployed there and, even more surprisingly, we have American teams in Soviet facilities looking at the weapons there. One of the features of this on-site inspection is that it can be done at very short notice. The other side does not have time to prepare and hide weapons that it might have deployed. But the whole subject of verification never seems to get a recognition of importance from the Nuclear Disarmament Party and all the other unilateral disarmers who want us to sign agreements willy-nilly without any checks and balances--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Australian Democrats. They say, essentially, `Let us disarm and because we are honest and good looking no-one will attack us'. Unfortunately, the world is not like that. It is interesting, in looking at the statement that has been put down by the Government today on the joint defence facilities, to see that in many ways it extends the concessions or the lease agreements, in so far as they are extended for 10 years to the United States. We welcome that because there has to be stability in these agreements. Alliances are made between nations, not between governments. We cannot have alliances between nations that change from day to day as governments of the day change. Certainly, when we come into government in 12 months time, or whenever the Government calls the next election, we will honour this agreement, as I am sure the Government in the times that it is in government through the next 10 years, will stand by the agreement it has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one sense it is a great public sign of failure for the nuclear disarmers, the Democrats and the other Soviet funded peace groups that exist in this country that a couple of years back targeted this year as a time of increasing and intense activity so that they could drive the Government into not renewing the agreements with the United States. It is with pleasure that one notes that those Soviet funded peace groups have failed utterly because the Government was not in the least deterred from doing what was essential in the Australian national interest. The strategy of those peace groups is to remove joint defence facilities from Australia. They have failed in that for 10 years. The rest of the strategy is to develop a nuclear free north-west Pacific, or to engineer a situation there to support the Soviet aim of decoupling or neutralising Japan from the Western alliance. I do not think that will succeed for a whole variety of reasons, but part and parcel of that is the current strategy of these Soviet funded groups to talk about the freedom of the seas, denuclearising the seas, or whatever the policy is. It is directed basically at the creation of a nuclear free zone in the north-west Pacific area so that Japan can be isolated. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the importance of these bases lies in the fact that they have made a major contribution to peace and security, not for this country alone but for the whole world, because we have operated under a system of nuclear deterrence ever since the nuclear age started. As I have said before in this chamber, I do not believe that it is the best system in the world, but at least it has worked and has kept the world free from a major conflagration for over 40 years. That is not to be lightly dismissed because in this century alone two huge world wars have resulted in the loss of millions of lives. World War I from 1914 to 1918 and World War II from 1939 to 1945 were without parallel in the history of civilization in the death and devastation that they brought to humanity. We have avoided conflicts of that type through the policy of nuclear deterrence. I do not happen to believe that in a hundred years time we will be following a policy of nuclear deterrence. This is why it is so important to see whether the strategic defence initiative can work. I think in the longer haul we will go to a safer system than nuclear deterrence, but at the present time we have that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western nations are working towards a goal of reducing the level of nuclear armaments in the world, and in the Gorbachev era we are getting good support from the Soviet Union. While I strongly defend the place of nuclear deterrence at the present time, I am the first to acknowledge that we have far more nuclear weapons than we need to provide that level of nuclear deterrence. The system can operate at a magnitude of weapons several times removed from the present one, and that of course is the goal of this Government, of the Liberal Party and of the Western alliance when we talk about the need for mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions of nuclear weapons. I come back to the importance of the deterrence system. Not only has it kept the peace; it has enabled us to go down the path towards arms reductions. Within the last 12 months we have seen the INF agreement, which is quite historic. A whole class of nuclear weapons has been entirely removed and broken up and I believe the world is that much safer for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Americans are prepared to start immediately on the strategic arms reduction talks and it only requires some cooperation from the Soviets before the START negotiations, which will deal with massive reductions in intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), can take place. I believe that once the talks begin they will go to a successful conclusion, because the will is there in both parties to reduce the number of nuclear weapons that we have. The sticking point with the START agreement for the Americans is the existence of the mobile ICBMs in the Soviet arsenals, as they are very hard to verify. The sticking point for the Soviets is the sea launched cruise missiles, which again are very hard to verify. One can check ships out, but one has no guarantee that 24 hours later those ships will not have acquired from a submarine or from another surface ship a load of sea launched cruise missiles. In the end, I believe that both the Soviets and the United States will come to some agreement which accommodates their differences over those problems and puts them in the background. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) on the way he has handled the joint defence facilities while he has had that portfolio. While poor Mr Beazley has very little to be congratulated on with his record level of failure as a defence Minister in the broader sense, he has taken the view that he should inform the Australian community as much as he can about these joint defence facilities. Progressively over the years, inch by inch, the door has been opened a little. I think it still has a way to go, and I would like to see it go a bit further because I hold to the Churchillian doctrine of trusting the people. The defence of this nation involves everyone. It involves everyone making considerable sacrifices of money and of their lives on some occasions. The defence of the nation cannot be left in the hands of a few elite who know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the reasons for the defence of Australia in itself, the reasons for the defence of the Western alliance and the reasons for the maintenance of world peace and security can be explained to the Australian people and their support can be enlisted. To that extent I welcome the moves that Mr Beazley has made to open up the joint facilities to a broader understanding by the Australian community. The joint facilities themselves are related to the alliances which Australia has. I turn to The Defence of Australia, the White Paper published in 1987, which is now the bible for Australian defence. On the first page, headed `Australia's defence policy', the second paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA>This policy of defence self-reliance is pursued within a framework of alliances and agreements. The most significant of these is with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to develop the importance of alliances. I would like to examine for a moment the record of this Government with respect to our alliances because even with the kindest interpretation it is a very, very dubious record. Alliances place obligations on both parties, even if they are not called up in their active form. Under this Government we had the Invincible incident in 1983: a British ship was denied docking facilities when it was in need of mechanical repair. That sent great shock waves through the American defence establishment, because it could just as easily have been one of its ships. Then we had the MX missiles decision. The Prime Minister had agreed in effect to enable some inert missiles to splash down in the Pacific because he granted refuelling rights to the observation aircraft-which was a reasonable thing to do and something that I would have thought was obligatory on us under the terms of the United States alliance-only to have his decision reversed by the lefties in the Australian Labor Party, screaming from under their beds. This again had a devastating effect on the way the United States viewed the stability of Australia in the alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Then only a couple of months ago we had HMS Edinburgh, again with mechanical problems, wanting dry-docking facilities in Australia. The British Government asked the Australian Government whether it could guarantee that if the ship went into dry dock it would be serviced and it would sail when the service was completed. As it could not get the guarantees for that it did not make the formal application. That also was devastating for Australia's alliance. The British Government sends Royal Navy ships to Australia with a frequency of about one ship visit a year-maybe two; maybe none. It is a very low frequency. The Americans send at least 60 naval vessels here each year and they face the absolute certainty that at some time they are going to have a mechanical problem with the propulsion unit of a ship, through it rubbing against a dock or something like that and damaging the propeller. What are they going to do? Are they going to send a tug down from Pearl Harbour or Subic Bay? They are very worried about this and they have a right to be worried, because the response of the Government, in an act of blatant cowardice by not standing up to the Seamen's Union of Australia, the dock workers and the other sorts of people who are holding the country to ransom and writing the foreign policy for Senator Evans, is to say that it will buy a few tugs. Royal Australian Navy tugs will not solve the problem if there is a need to replace a propeller on a damaged US warship. </PARA>
<PARA> So, by a different route, this country with respect to its alliances has got itself into precisely the same position as the socialist Lange Government has got New Zealand into. Visits to Australia by American ships are now very much under a cloud. While I am on the subject of alliances and the way they are viewed by other countries, I cannot help reflecting that the man who made this statement on the joint defence facilities in the House of Representatives was the Prime Minister; and it was no-one other than the Prime Minister who, in that rabidly far left communistic phase he once was in, in 1976 and in earlier years, put his name to an advertisement in every newspaper in Australia calling for the abolition of the bases. So while it is part of the Judeo-Christian ethos of Australia that redemption is possible, it is certainly viewed with a jaundiced eye by military people around the world when someone who was violently opposed to the bases only about a decade ago now gets up and defends them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I would like to look at in relation to our alliance is how reliable an ally Australia is. How reliable are we? What sort of preparedness is this Government prepared to make for our own defence? That is an important point, because one of the operative doctrines in respect of the ANZUS agreement is the Nixon statement of the 1969-70 era. The so-called Guam doctrine of the United States foreign policy is still the operative document. That doctrine sets out three precepts. The first is that the US will keep all its treaty commitments. The second is that the US shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied to the US or a nation whose survival the US considers vital to its security and the security of the region as a whole. The third requirement is that, in cases involving other types of aggression, the US shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested and as appropriate. The most important qualification in the Guam doctrine is where the US goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defence. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is an obligation on Australia under the Guam doctrine to prepare its own defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week the report of a subcommittee of the Joint Committee or Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was tabled in this place. This subcommittee, which is part of the biggest and most important committee in this Parliament, dealt with the crisis in the rates of resignation from the Australian defence forces. It analysed the reasons why around 45,000 men and women, out of a force structure of roughly 70,000, have voted with their feet and left the Australian defence forces since the Australian Labor Party came to power five years ago, a loss which, as the report says, has destroyed our defence capability not for a year but for at least a decade-presuming that the correct remedial action is taken, which so far the Government has not shown any inclination to do. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a grievous loss of personnel from what are very small defence forces for Australia. These defence forces were highly competent, and certainly they were very professional before they bled to death as a result of high resignation rates. The Government just does not seem to recognise what is going on with respect to the capabilities of the Australian defence forces. Not only have we lost capability; we have also lost billions of dollars in real terms, because we trained the 45,000 men and women who have left and their average training cost was extremely high. That is a very great loss to the community, because their replacements have all got to be retrained. It is no exaggeration to say that the cost to the Australian taxpayer runs into billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The report went on to analyse why this was so. A fundamental point, of course, was the lack of leadership-the leadership failings of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly), the Ministry, the Government and, sadly, the Parliament as a whole. Many people in the Australian defence forces feel, and have felt, that no-one in the Government respects them or values the sacrifices that they make for this country. So they leave and follow another career. Part of this has been engendered by the inability of the Minister for Defence to stand up for his Department and fight for funds. We are now in a desperate position in respect of funding for the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 10 years ago the Department of Defence foresaw that, in the period from the mid-1980s through well into the 1990s, a great amount of new equipment would have to be bought to replace obsolescent equipment in the Australian defence forces. Provisions were made for that. The rolling five-year defence program on which the defence budgets are calculated was designed so that the capability of the Defence Force could be maintained and the new equipment could be bought. But a 4 1/2 per cent real growth per annum was required through that five-year period from the end of 1984 through to 1989 for that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Government done? With a weak Minister who cannot fight with the social services, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and others in Cabinet for a fair share of funds for the nation's essential defence interests, we have seen cuts every year in defence. This year alone there is a real cut of one per cent. There will be a cut on that of one per cent next year. The situation is really desperate. Ten years ago 18.2 per cent of the defence vote went to new capital equipment facilities. Now the figure is 29.6 per cent. Ten years ago 54.3 per cent of the defence budget went on personnel, the men and women in the Defence Force. Today the figure is 42.3 per cent. So there has been a huge lift in the ratio being allocated for the purchase of new capital equipment and a savage cut in what is going to personnel. The balance is totally wrong. Such a cut could be made without causing damage only if the size of the defence vote had increased. In fact, it has contracted-and contracted very considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> The worrying thing is that the situation is getting worse. Next year the Australian Defence Force will hold a big and ambitious exercise. That exercise, which is called Kangaroo 89, will involve the whole of 1st Division from the Army being deployed around the north of Australia, with major involvements by the Navy and the Air Force. Already we have seen gross reductions in defence expenditure or outgoings to compensate for what is now going to be a very reduced Kangaroo 89 exercise. Immediately after the Budget, the Chief of the General Staff, the head of the Army, circularised to all Army units that all outgoings would be cut back by 10 per cent. I see in today's paper that all Air Force flying is going to be cut back by 10 per cent. If that happens there will be a lot more accidents, because the present level of flying is either just below or at the barest minimum level required for competence to be maintained. We are seeing great cuts in command post exercises, or CPXs, which were set up before Kangaroo 89 in order that staff training could be put in place and analysis undertaken so that the most can be gained from the exercise. Those functions have been reduced to under a half. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, we are seeing a great cut in the amount of money that is going to the reserves, particularly the Army reserves. The scheme under which the Army reserves are integrated into the Army is working very well. The reserves have been neglected by all governments over the years. They have not had the priority for funding that they should have. This Government promised members of the reserves complete parity with members of the regular Army. The Government promised that they would be provided with adequate equipment and adequate funds to carry out their tasks. But the Government cut training days and taxed reserve personnel. However, it has now increased training days and removed the taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The 12 Psychology Unit, a reserve unit from New South Wales, is due to go on its annual camp in the near future. But it simply has no money for rations. I have never heard of a more absurd situation than that. The unit will have to run its camp on a day parade basis with the diggers bringing a cut lunch. Coupled with the cuts in buying rations that were announced last week, we really are a mickey mouse operation. A more serious situation is the breaking of the promise with respect of the 105 Hamel guns. The reserve artillery units were promised that they would get the new 105 guns to replace the M2A2 that has been in service for many years. About 105 of these guns were to go to the permanent Army, with a further 43 of these guns to the reserve units. That reserve order has now been cancelled. The disappointment in reserve units will be enormous. It is a stupid decision too. We are producing this weapon in Australia and I support Government moves increasingly to make weapons and equipment for the armed services in Australia. But it is absolute nonsense to close the production line down and talk about buying new 105s from the United Kingdom if we need them, because the one thing that Australian defence manufacturing industry needs is continuity of orders. We are better off buying fewer units per year and keeping a production line going continuously rather than having a stop-start business with the inherent high costs that are involved. The Opposition welcomes the statement that has been tabled by the Government but we ask that it be viewed against the whole picture of Australia's defence, which is one of inadequacy, not to say disaster. It is no excuse for the Government to say after 5 1/2 years in office that it inherited the mess that we are in today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly with great distress that I speak about this 10-year agreement which was presented as a fait accompli to the people of Australia yesterday. The principal grievance is that, depite earlier proposals within the Australian Labor Party for discussions prior to any new arrangement, there was no community debate about the lease agreements after they changed in 1986-87. As usual, it was all done in secret and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) simply tabled the signed notes after they were signed a week ago by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the departing United States Ambassasor, Mr Bill Lane. This reflects a very bad process, I think, within the Labor Party, the governing party of this country, in which all factions certainly represent people in the community who would disagree with this decision. Resolution after resolution was passed at branch meetings but they were totally ignored. They reach the level of the State Executive and they are then tossed aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Labor Party will find a great lack of willing workers when next if faces an election, and I wonder whether there will be a great spate of resignations from the Party. Of course, the opposition is not confined to just the Labor Party: there are people in the National and Liberal parties also who will be disappointed that this decision has been made for a further 10 years. I remind the Senate that in 1986 the `no nuclear warships' write-on campaign during the Western Australian election saw 10 per cent of the people who voted for the Liberal Party write `no nuclear warships' on their ballot paper. That is a very clear indication that there is a constituency within the Liberal Party and also in the National Party, I believe, which is opposed to Australia having any involvement whatsoever with nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that under the Westminster system the Executive can make decisions like this. It can sign notes of agreement with foreign powers and it does not have to consult with Parliament. It does not even have to consult with its own elected representatives and it certainly does not have to consult with the people. Of course, we are told in a very cynical way, `If you do not like what the Government does, you change the Government'. I would like to present an imaginary scenario tonight. I ask honourable senators to imagine that we had a coalition government-a Liberal-National Party government. Of course, one would expect such a government to make this kind of agreement although, as I have said, I think there are people within those parties and among their elected representatives who would not be happy about it. Imagine that the Opposition was in government and had just signed this 10-year agreement. The Labor Party in opposition would probably go to the next election on this issue opposing the agreement and it would romp it in. It would win an election on this issue because the public opinion polls in Australia are very clearly showing that the more people know about these bases the less they like them. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that it is the Labor Party doing what we might expect of the coalition. The Labor Party is ignoring its own supporters and it is a very cynical exercise indeed because it knows very well that there is not a better alternative on this issue as far as the national government goes. So I think it is just as well that we have people in this place at least who are prepared to stand up and voice their opposition to such appalling decisions which show such a total disregard for public opinion. So there will be many people in Australia tonight who will be feeling extremely disfranchised and who will be very pleased indeed that there are a group of Australian Democrats in this place and a couple of Independents who will continue to have the guts to stand up and say what needs to be said and to speak the truth on this issue because we are not getting the truth from anybody in the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> What an abrogation it is of our sovereignty, especially in this our bicentennial year. Our sovereignty has been chucked out the window for another 10 years. So much for the glowing bicentennial talk. We are not able to chart an independent course on the international stage. It is a disgrace-a national disgrace. It makes me feel ashamed to be an Australian and to see us handing over our sovereignty to United States foreign policy, because that is what it amounts to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many Australians today who feel disfranchised and disappointed because their elected representatives here in both Houses of the Parliament are not speaking out against this decision. Mind you, it is not too late for them to do so and I would be delighted to hear from anybody from the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party with the guts to speak out on this issue because so many of them know that it is not in the interests of Australia and that it is an immoral position for Australia to take. They are not being true to their own knowledge and, in many cases, they are not being true to the people that they meant to represent. I hope that people in the community will voice their disgust to their elected representatives right across the political spectrum at this agreement made by a Labor Government, of all governments. They would be voicing their opposition because the people in the community know that nuclear weapons are totally immoral and they know that the threat to use them, the presence of nuclear weapons and their very existence are totally immoral. </PARA>
<PARA> No nation, no individual has any moral right to threaten to use any weapons of mass destruction. There is no excuse, no reason and no justification, regardless of enemy perceptions or interests to be defended, and it is indefensible on any ground to consider the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Of course, by signing ourselves into this agreement for a further 10 years we are totally taking Australia along the same path for a longer period when we help the United States in its nuclear war fighting strategies. We are helping one of the superpowers with the possible use of these deadly weapons which are totally immoral under international law and against the laws of humanity and certainly against the laws of commonsense. So why has this change taken place? Suddenly the Labor Government, which we would not have expected to sign this kind of agreement for 10 further years, has done so in total secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, claims that he initiated the changes a year ago. A couple of years ago I asked a question in this place about whether there was any intention to change the agreements, and I was told very clearly that the agreements were working just fine as they were-that is, on a year-by-year basis-and that there was no intention to change them and the Government saw no need to change them. So why is it happening now? Mr Beazley says that it was not due to United States pressure, but it certainly looks that way. I believe that both the United States Government and the Australian Government are very aware of the changing opinion polls on this subject in Australia. It is as a result of the very good education program that has been carried out by the peace movement in this country over the past few years that the opinion polls are reflecting quite a dramatic change on this subject. In the latest defence track polls 44 per cent of Australians are shown to be opposed to United States bases on Australian soil; 58 per cent of young people under 25 are opposed to the bases; and 50 per cent of women are opposed to the bases. There used to be far more support for the bases when people did not know what they were there for but the more people know about them, the greater the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note the age difference. Older people, who have a very much East-West view of the world and who were brainwashed very successfully, I believe, in the 1950s, are dying off and young people who have a different world view and who have not succumbed to the Moscow or Washington scenario are making much more intelligent decisions and they have a much more holistic view of the global family. That is how we must think of our world if we are to survive. We cannot continue to think in terms of the East-West bloc and to put all of our stakes in the Washington basket in opposition to the Moscow basket. That is a totally outmoded way of thinking. The greenhouse effect is showing us that. We must work together as a global community if we are to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says that the peace movement should support these bases now because there is greater Australian participation. I do not care how much Australian participation there is in the bases, their function remains the same-and that is to assist the nuclear war fighting strategies of the United States Government. Of course, there is no Australian in a top position. The best position that any Australian can be offered is a deputy position and it does not matter how many of them are there because the point is that the intelligence that is gathered by these bases is handed over to the United States. Once that happens no Australian has any control over the use to which it is put. </PARA>
<PARA> When we ask how the bases contribute to global stability we are told that much of the information is classified. In other words, the Government says, `Trust us'. The Australian Government is, in turn, trusting the United States Government. I think it is indeed misplaced trust. The United States does not have a very good track record; neither has our Government because of its deception and lying by omission. It does not have a very good record which would encourage us to trust it. We can find out more about what goes on in the bases from the United States under its freedom of information Act than we can from any Australian source. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a terrific obsession with secrecy in this country. I think it is really misplaced and totally unnecessary. We object to what we are not told about the bases, specifically the intelligence role and the first strike capability. Even Des Ball, who supports the existence of Pine Gap, though not Nurrungar, says that Pine Gap is doing monitoring and verification work only 40 per cent of the time. What is it doing the rest of the time? The satellites can look down over most of Asia. We know that the United States has used satellite intelligence in the past to pass on to allies such as Israel and the United Kingdom. Whom is the United States watching in Asia? To whom does it pass the information? For what purposes is it used? It is not only tracking and targeting of the Soviet Union that we, in the peace movement, are concerned about, although that is an overriding concern because it involves the use of weapons of mass destruction. It is also the information that the United States can use for its low intensity conflict such as warfare in places such as the Philippines and Central America. </PARA>
<PARA> Pine Gap makes us identify with the United States foreign policy through the selection of satellite observation areas even though our foreign policy objectives are not the same as those of the United States. They certainly should not be any way. It is about time we had an independent streak in our foreign policy. The first strike capability is something that our Government will not admit to. The Australian Government continues to quote United States government figures on deterrents but it has always ignored the differences between stated aims and actual policies. The military options are alive and well in the United States despite some glib political statements made by people such as President Reagan about nuclear weapons never being used and that a nuclear war must never be fought. The military planners in the United States have a doctrine of flexible options. Their intention is to use those nuclear weapons if they see fit to do so. We must not forget that there is a huge discrepancy between the military objectives and the stated political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Nurrungar is concerned, according to documentation received from the United States Senate in 1982, General Randolph said of the NUDET system, which is a part of the Nurrungar system, `It is a war fighting capability'. Again, in March 1985, General Kutyna, when asked if the United States early warning system had a battle management capability, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, Sir . . . if you want to know which silos they have launched out of you can go after the full ones if you want to'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from two defence personnel in the United States who obviously intend to use the systems at their disposal with the cooperation of the bases in Australia. It is very clear that the military personnel in the United States want to hang onto those options. They spend all of their working hours working out exactly how well they can target the Soviet Union and how they can manage to get at the silos which have not been emptied. This is the kind of information used and passed to the United States through Nurrungar. The United States can identify which silos have been used and which ones remain to be taken out by the United States. That is a nuclear war fighting capability if ever there was one. </PARA>
<PARA> The new staffing arrangements show how much we have been coerced by the United States policy. We have surrendered our political independence. We seem to be identifying more and more with the United States world view. If it is true that the Minister for Defence initiated the change, it shows how totally he has gone over to a United States perspective on this. He is doing its thinking for it. Yet this is the man who, only a few years ago when the Labor Party was in opposition-I am beginning to think that may be the best place for it; it says some really good things in opposition-was asking the same sort of questions I am now asking. When he has been asked since what he has done with his conscience and how and why he has turned around on this issue, he cannot say anything. He has nothing to say. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask: what is in it for the Labor Government? What is in this for Bob Hawke? Why is Kim Beazley doing the thinking for the United States planners? The bases were set up in the 1960s to serve United States needs before any arms control agreements were ever signed. The monitoring and verification roles were thrown in later as an extra. Whatever the Prime Minister says about them, they play a legitimising role and were thrown in after the bases were established. They were established for the military prospectus of the United States. The United States has now thrown in the monitoring and verification system. Of course, it is very important that we have monitoring and verification. But I believe that Australia would be much better served by being part of an international monitoring and verification team. Why should we be doing the dirty work for one superpower against the other? Ipso facto then, the Soviet Union becomes our enemy and we become its nuclear target. It does not add up to a very sensible or logical position. If one thinks about the immorality of the possible use of nuclear weapons and Australia's contribution to that it is not to be commended in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no mention in the speech of the Prime Minister yesterday about the impending redundancy of Nurrungar. It is most important that we understand the nuclear war fighting capabilities of Nurrungar and Pine Gap. The United States is now deploying advance nuclear detonation sensors on its new global positioning system-NAVSTAR. They should be fully deployed by the end of 1989, by which time technically Nurrungar could be considered obsolete. The data they pick up does not then have to be transmitted to Nurrungar in order to be relayed to the United States. It will go there directly via a UHF satellite to satellite relay. The United States has also created a satellite to satellite laser cross link enabling the DSP satellites to exchange data with each other without the need for ground relay stations. When this system is fully operational in a few years time, Nurrungar will no longer play a necessary role in either transmitting the critical DSP east data to the United States or processing that data. Once this system is operational, the arguments pertaining to the early warning role of Nurrungar will have lost much of their force. </PARA>
<PARA> Why now has the Labor Government decided to enter into a 10-year agreement? I believe it is because of pressure from the United States because it would be a great loss of face to the United States. It might set a precedence if any of the bases of the United States in Australia were closed down. The United States sees the writing on the wall as far as the opinion polls are concerned. It has other reasons for wanting to keep Nurrungar open as a backup system: firstly, the Nurrungar ground station is more capable than the mobile ground terminals in the United States; secondly, the United States seeks to have as much redundancy-that is, duplication-in its strategic systems as possible. That goes for all of them including the North West Cape which incidentally was not even mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech yesterday. The extension of an agreement is probably still being worked out. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason why the United States wants to keep Nurrungar operational, even though it will not be of vital strategic importance, is that valuable research data is collected at Nurrungar which has little to do with early warning and which probably cannot be collected by the mobile ground terminals. It also provides command and control functions for the DSP east satellites which currently cannot be carried out remotely from the United States. There was also an argument about the Star Wars role of Nurrungar. It is almost certain that data on the boost phase of Soviet missile launches is still being collected at Nurrungar and handed over to the strategic defence initiative (SDI) office. This could also be used in a future SDI boost phase warning target acquisition and damage assessment system. North West Cape is also facing redundancy but will, for some of the reasons I have just mentioned relating to Nurrungar, be deemed desirable to be kept in place by the United States military, if for no other reason than that it would create a very dangerous precedent if a foreign base operated by the United States military was seen to close down. It could have a domino effect. Of course, this is what the United States was so scared about. It gave a name to the increasing opposition to the nuclear aspect of alliance arrangements after the New Zealanders very bravely chose to keep nuclear weapons out of their ports. The United States called it the Kiwi disease and of course it does not want it to spread. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence says that North West Cape is more valuable to Australia than to the United States. But the fact is that it is far more than we shall ever need with our small fleet in the region. However, as has been shown by recent opinion polls conducted by the Australian peace movement, many Australians have the view that as long as North West Cape loses its nuclear connections-that is, as long as the Americans are not operating out of North West Cape-they would be much happier to see it being used by the Royal Australian Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the peace movement want in terms of the bases? For a long time we have been calling for a national inquiry into the role of the bases. It is time that the public had more information provided to it by our Government. What the Prime Minister told us yesterday was an insult to the intelligence of anybody who has read anything about the role and function of the so-called joint facilities. It is what the peace movement has been saying for years and years-in fact, ever since it was established. We do not hear officially from the Government about the cynical use to which the information could be put. I believe that people in Australia have a right to this information. They need to be able to make an informed decision on this matter. Of course, the Government does not want us to have a fully funded public inquiry in this issue of the bases because it knows very well that informed public opinion would go against the bases. Australians do not want to be tied into the military operations of any other country, be it the United States or any other country, particularly if it involves the use of weapons of mass destruction. So the first thing that we think should be done, and we will continue to call for it, is that a national inquiry into the role of the bases be established. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that more work should be done by the Australian Government on an international system of monitoring and verification, rather than tying Australia into the arms race and identifying with one military superpower as against the other. We realise that the United States will not turn over its very expensive satellites or other technology to an international body, but we need to explore proposals such as the French proposal of some years ago or the current Canadian proposals. There is no technical impediment to an international verification and monitoring system. We should be working with other countries in our region, checking up on all countries which hold nuclear weapons-the French, the Chinese, the British, the South Africans, and the Israelis and possible nuclear nations like India, Pakistan, Brazil and Argentina. All of the world's people have an interest in seeing nuclear disarmament come about, so all of the countries which have nuclear weapons at their disposal or which have the capability of making nuclear weapons need to be monitored by the rest of the nations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a role that I think Australia should be taking very seriously. We have a responsibility to be part of an international monitoring system. As I have said, there is no technical impediment but only a lack of political will on this subject. But increasingly the tide of opinion is turning on this matter of international verification, rather than the national technical means of verification-that is, the United States doing its own checking up on the Soviet Union, with the help of allies such as Australia, and the Soviet Union doing its checking up on the United States. The member states of the United Nations are increasingly calling for international monitoring and verification as the only responsible position to take. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, I oppose the bases because I believe that we must get beyond the bloc thinking which has dominated the world since 1945. To work towards the de-alignment of Australia from the nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union is my aim. To do that we must get rid of all foreign military facilities from our soil. We must work towards a nuclear free and independent Australia within the wider context of a truly nuclear free and independent Pacific and a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean as well as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia. That means an end to all foreign bases in the region, including the Soviet bases in Vietnam, the French colonial presence in the South Pacific, and all the United States military and intelligence facilities in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the peace movement is isolationist, and nor am I talking about neutrality. I am talking about a de-aligned and independent Australia that can take a constructive role for disarmament along with other middle ranking powers on the world stage. The peace movement will not be silenced by this recent decision by the Government. We will not stop our community education program. It is very interesting that peace groups around the country, of course, in voicing their opposition have some very particular concerns. I would like to quote from a press release put out by the Alice Springs Peace Group today. Of course the people there appreciate very much their position as nuclear targets. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Alice Springs Peace Group calls on all Alice Springs residents to take special note that the Government which so readily signs up for another 10 years under the nuclear umbrella has received only a few weeks ago a report on the risks to our town of an attack on the base which states clearly that 5,000 of us will die if nuclear war breaks out. In 10 years time the number will be twice or three times that. Is this the way our Government looks after our security?</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I reiterate that these bases contribute nothing to Australia's security. Pine Gap and Nurrungar have nothing to do with Australia's defence. The only exception to that is North West Cape, which I referred to earlier, which is used by the Royal Australian Navy, but in a time of crisis all the communications channels are handed over to the United States, and we get a communications channel accessible to us only if the United States does not want all the channels. So much for our independence. So much for the shared and joint nature of the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The bases that the Prime Minister's statement referred to, Pine Gap and Nurrungar, make nuclear targets out of us and contribute nothing whatsoever to our defence. We will continue in our opposition to the bases until we see Australia free of its immoral contribution to the arms race. The people in the community know that this position is right. Eventually politicians will have to reflect the wisdom of an informed public. As I said in concluding my first speech in this Parliament of Australia, where I am proud to serve people who voted for me and proud to continue to be a voice true to the issues on which I was elected, when the people lead the leaders will follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very strange bicentennial gift that the Labor Government has given to Australia. Basically, the gift is the admission to the world that Australia is well and truly the fifty-first State of the United States of America, that we are all Americans. The United States prompted this change in the agreement. This change in the agreement about the bases was not prompted by Australia at all; it was done by the US, and it was done for the reasons that have already been outlined by Senator Vallentine. The United States is very worried about the opinions in Australia, which are changing so rapidly against the bases. So many people are worried about the bases. So many people see the dangers and so many people realise that there are very few benefits or no benefits in having them. The peace campaign is working, and this, of course, frightens the United States. It frightens the defence establishment, and when the defence establishment is frightened in the United States it pulls the levers and Australia responds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I am ashamed to be Australian at this moment. I came to Australia as a migrant from America thinking that this was a free and independent country. I came here when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister. He looked like such a bright, shining beacon on the world stage. Now I find that the Australia of today is nothing but an imitation of that Australia. In fact, it is very much like Nixon's America, the America that I left. I would like to point out, too, that as a former American I know that the Americans like us, but they do not respect us-and that is because we are so eager to follow the wishes and will of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)? The Prime Minister made much of the increased Australian participation in the key operations and management of Pine Gap and Nurrungar. This, according to the Prime Minister, `reinforces our confidence that our interests and sovereignty are respected at all times', and means that `Australia will be able to take more direct advantage of the facilities' capabilities for our own purposes than has been practicable in the past'. I do not believe that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that Australians do play an increased role at Pine Gap and Nurrungar, Australia is becoming a de facto nuclear power. One of the fingers on the nuclear button is now Australian. Of course, the massive thumb on that launch button is still American. Pine Gap and Nurrungar still remain fundamentally under United States control. The facilities still serve American purposes, not Australian purposes. Pine Gap's satellites gather signals intelligence according to American priorities. Their main target is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) rather than countries in Australia's region. According to the Australian National University's Professor Des Ball, the targets which the satellites are to spy on are set out in a monthly joint reconnaissance schedule, which is prepared in the United States by the National Reconnaissance Office and approved by the National Reconnaissance Executive Committee. Nowhere in that procedure is there any Australian input. The National Reconnaissance Executive Committee is chaired by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and includes the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and a representative of the Pentagon. </PARA>
<PARA> The only Australian involvement in satellite scheduling comes after the real decisions have been made in the day to day implementation of the joint reconnaissance schedule. Nurrungar is the trigger which could initiate a US nuclear attack on the USSR. It also allows the US to locate nuclear targets inside the USSR during the course of the `protracted' and `controlled' nuclear wars for which the Pentagon has laid detailed plans. As the Government has now admitted, Nurrungar is part of the defence support program. This is an American satellite system operated by the US Air Force's Space Command and used by the Aerospace Defence Command, the Strategic Air Command, the National Military Command system, the Atlantic, Pacific and European commands and the intelligence agencies. Again, it does not need to be said that these are American agencies, not Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Pine Gap and Nurrungar will always be under US command. I do not think anyone in this chamber could honestly think that they will be turned over to Australia to be used for Australian purposes. The claim that Australia can use the bases for its own purposes raises the question of what those purposes are. In the case of Pine Gap, the Government is presumably talking about spying on radio communications in the South-East Asian, south-west Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean regions. Of course Australia already does this, using the electronic spy bases run by the Defence Signals Directorate, or DSD. The Royal Australian Navy patrols the region, as do P3 Orion aircraft. The Australian Secret Intelligence Service, (ASIS), also attempts to spy on our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Australian National University's Professor Des Ball was asked how Australia could collect adequate intelligence for its own purposes. His view was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if you put DSD together with an efficient and capable Department of Foreign Affairs, using diplomats to gather information . . . without engaging in clandestine activities, then that would be satisfactory for our purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be. Why, then, do we have to go through this charade of saying that the Americans are giving us necessary data from Pine Gap and Nurrungar when in fact it is not happening? Mr Beazley himself is so proud of our own spying abilities that he told Parliament on 24 February last year:</PARA>
<PARA> We have our own intelligence gathering capability and it is very effective. </PARA>
<PARA>So why does Australia need increased access to Pine Gap? The answer seems to lie in the Government's new self-appointed role of regional policeman. It wants to know as much as possible about other countries' domestic affairs, far more than is needed for any genuine Australian security purposes. Australia's neighbours have every right to feel threatened by our present ability to spy on them. The added prospect of being monitored by Pine Gap adds to Australia's image as the big brother of this region, and it is not a benign big brother. </PARA>
<PARA> The best protection in this region for all of us is, of course, to remove the bases. Much has been said about Pine Gap's role in verification. We are often told by the Government that we are participating in the keeping of the peace in the world by the verification role of Pine Gap and Nurrungar. In a statement Mr Hawke claimed `intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes importantly to the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements'. He talked about the breakthrough achieved in the intermediate range nuclear forces (INF) treaty, under which US and Soviet medium and short range missiles are now being destroyed. He mentioned the current strategic arms reduction talks (START) which, if successful, will reduce the US and Soviet long range nuclear arsenals to half their present size, and he claimed that without Pine Gap and Nurrungar `the INF Treaty could not have been signed and the START process would not have got underway'. That is utter rubbish. Verification, the process of checking that the other side has not cheated on an arms agreement, has been the Government's prime justification for the bases for some time. The Government has used verification to deflect criticism of the espionage and nuclear war fighting roles of the bases. </PARA>
<PARA> But the facts do not support the Government's case. The Pine Gap installation performs only one specific function which is potentially relevant to verification-it can monitor the test flights of Soviet nuclear missiles. The Nurrungar situation has to do, as Senator Vallentine said, with the location of empty silos and, by deduction, the location of full silos so that American missiles will not be wasted on empty ones but may be used more effectively on full ones. The verification role of the INF treaty that Mr Hawke is so proud of-we are all proud of the treaty-actually does far more than just limit nuclear weapons. I quote from a New Scientist article of 9 June 1988, headed `Verification pact underscores summit success':</PARA>
<PARA> The science of verification is at the heart of the treaty on Intermediate Nuclear Forces signed last week in Moscow by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Both sides agree that the treaty has the most comprehensive and intrusive rules ever established to monitor compliance with an agreement on arms control. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that what this treaty really did was make an arrangement for the first time so that military observers from the Soviet Union could visit the United States and United States observers could visit the Soviet Union. There is a swap of personnel. The paranoia that has surrounded the arms race for years is now evaporating. Unfortunately it has not evaporated in Australia or in this chamber, but around the world, in the real world, in the Soviet Union and in the United States, people are starting to trust one another. There was an article recently in the papers, basically buried right at the back on page 26 or on the weather page, headed, `Nuclear tests in the United States monitored by Soviet scientists'. There was another article a few days later headed `Nuclear tests in the Soviet Union monitored by United States scientists'. That is a massive breakthrough in trust for peace. Although they were monitoring nuclear tests, at least they were there: they were allowed to be on the evil empire's soil. There is a change taking place. I go back to the New Scientist article, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The procedures for monitoring the INF treaty even cover nuclear weapons not regulated by the treaty, notably the Soviet SS-25 inter-continental ballistic missiles. The purpose is to ensure that the Soviet Union does not disguise its stock of SS-20s, which are covered by the INF treaty and which physically resemble SS-25s. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the verification part:</PARA>
<PARA> For three years, or until a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty . . . comes into effect, the US can ask the Soviet Union to open the roofs of buildings housing SS-25 missiles and move the missiles and their launchers to open ground as American spy satellites pass overhead. </PARA>
<PARA>Some might immediately jump to the conclusion that these have something to do with Pine Gap. They do not. The American spy satellites are in a polar orbit. They have excellent sensing devices in that they are multi-spectral and they have optical, infra-red and ultra-violet very high resolution detection devices, and they actually pick up the data and transmit it to the United States on the next orbit or the next orbit but one. They do not need to relay data to Pine Gap. Pine Gap basically runs geostationary orbit satellites which are located over the Equator and in an orbit which matches the rotation of the earth and as such has no part in this type of verification. </PARA>
<PARA> The US is permitted six such requests a year for each missile base. The Soviet Union must meet a request within six hours, leaving roofs open and the missiles and launchers in full view until 12 hours after the request is received, according to the Arms Control Association, an independent body of observers in the United States. The Soviet Union and the United States have now exchanged the names of 200 inspectors on each side who will carry out the tasks of verifying the INF treaty on the other country's sovereign territory, or that of its allies. The inspectors will be able to visit military bases in Britain, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, East Germany and Czechoslovakia as well as bases in the US and the Soviet Union. The inspectors must be technicians, linguists and diplomats. They should not, however, operate as intelligence agents, and both superpowers can object to particular individuals within 20 days of being given the list of 200 names. There are a number of different types of inspections. Both countries can, between 30 and 90 days after the treaty comes into force, make baseline inspections of agreed facilities. They can also do close-out inspections which ensure that a military base that was once a facility for launching INF missiles has ceased to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a very interesting number of inspections called portal monitoring of production. This is a very unusual and intrusive inspection. The US and the Soviet Union can both establish a permanent team of 30 inspectors living near to a designated missile production plant. The US has chosen to establish its monitoring team on the doorstep of the Votkinsk machine building plant west of the Urals. The plant assembles SS-25 missiles, the strategic missile which the treaty does not cover but which can be confused with SS-20s. The Soviet Union has chosen the Hercules Plant Number One at Magma in Utah, where the US assembles its ground-launched ballistic missiles, notably the MX and the Trident weapons. So much for the Pine Gap verification role. Obviously it has no part to play in the modern disarmament situation because the United States and the Soviet Union have gone far beyond the time when all they could do was fly over each other's territory with spy planes or satellites and depend on them for information. We now have actual on-site inspection. There is no doubt and no disagreement anywhere in the world that on-site inspection is the most effective inspection-far better than any remote sensing could ever be. </PARA>
<PARA> What about Nurrungar? The Prime Minister stated that Nurrungar `would give the earliest warning of an intercontinental ballistic missiles attack on the US or its allies, which reduces the chances that US forces would be destroyed in a surprise attack and plays a vital role in helping to prevent nuclear war by accident'. The Government's statement is only one side of the coin. Nurrungar also gives the US the confidence that it can manage a nuclear war. The United States has devised detailed plans for fighting limited and protracted nuclear wars in which Nurrungar plays a key role. Firstly, Nurrungar's satellite can tell the US which Soviet missile silos are empty by detecting missile launches so that the United States does not waste its own missiles on them. Secondly, Nurrungar can tell the US whether a nuclear warhead aimed at a certain target was successful in destroying that target by detecting the resultant explosion. Anyone who doubts that these war plans exist need look only as far as a Pentagon document entitled Standard Operating Procedures for Nuclear Operations conducted by the Commander-In-Chief of US Forces in the Pacific. This document specifies operations in the event of `limited' nuclear wars and even plans to reconstitute US nuclear forces to fight World War IV once World War III is over. What a terrible indictment of the American thinking to actually be planning World War IV after World War III. This is the type of mind which is behind Pine Gap. It is at least as likely that the United States will start a nuclear war as it is that the USSR will do so. Nurrungar, North West Cape and Pine Gap will all be involved. Australia should have no part in these preparations for genocide. </PARA>
<PARA> What about North West Cape? The Prime Minister's speech made no mention of North West Cape, despite the fact that it is one of the three major US bases in Australia. Today's Age claimed that North West Cape's agreement would not be re-extended. At present, either side can give six months' notice of termination. This may reflect the fact that North West Cape has a purely offensive military function, namely, communicating with US surface ships and attack submarines, as well as Australian submarines. It is difficult to claim that North West Cape helps prevent nuclear war, although the Government has tried to do so in the past, and it is impossible to claim that the base contributes to verification. However, there is a strong possibility that the Government will secretly extend the North West Cape agreement at some time in the future. So far, Parliament has not been told otherwise. It is an odd thing that Parliament is not necessarily privy to this. These decisions are made by the Executive, not Parliament. We have tried for years with Bills, for example, to enable the Parliament of this country-the people of this country through the people's House-actually to control these agreements. Not so. Increasingly, it is the Prime Minister and the Executive of the present Labor Administration that control them. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from serving US interests, the Government may want to ensure continued Australian use of the base for submarine communications. The Government claims that 25 per cent of communications traffic through North West Cape is Australian. The Government should establish a parliamentary inquiry into the future of North West Cape. It should also inform Parliament of its plans for the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> What about democracy? On 25 November 1986 the Prime Minister answered a question on notice about the agreement covering Pine Gap, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The Agreement provides that when the present non-terminable period expires in October 1987, the Agreement continues in force unless either party gives due notice of termination. The Government does not at present see any need to alter that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>In the intervening two years the Government has changed its mind without even informing, let alone consulting, the Australian Parliament or the public. Yet again, a momentous decision on the bases has been presented as a fait accompli. This is an abuse of the executive power of government and is blatantly undemocratic. It is well known from public opinion polls that public interest in and concern about the bases are high. Senator Vallentine read out some of the recent poll results. Forty-four per cent of Australians want US bases to be removed; 51 per cent want US nuclear related communications bases removed; and 58 per cent want the ANZUS alliance either scrapped completely or made non-nuclear. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been large protests at all three major US bases in the last two years. Even farmers and conservative voters have questioned the value of the alliance, following the US-Europe trade war. The Government's response has been to secretly take the bases off the political agenda. There was no legal need to do so, and the agreements still stood. There was no political advantage in doing so, as many Australians now question the alliance. The Government is acting on behalf of American interests rather than those of its own people. This is government for the people, of the people, by the United States. It is time we became a mature member of the world community rather than being a snivelling, cringing, dependent colony. If we make a noise like a rug, we get walked on. Right now we sound like a very worn carpet indeed. It is time to close the bases. The bases must go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak as part of what I would describe as the conventional peace movement to attempt to balance the contribution to the debate made by the last two speakers, who are part of the unilateral disarmament movement. As I look around I see in the chamber others who I think could fairly be described as part of that conventional peace movement: Senator MacGibbon, Senator Tambling and Senator Crichton-Browne, to name three-people who want peace and security but who do not trust unilateral disarmament and who believe that Australia is better off if we are prepared to support our friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rose to speak also because I found it fascinating when I read the statement on the bases by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to think that perhaps he was referring to a press release I had issued on 8 April this year, shortly after I led an Opposition parliamentary delegation on a visit to both Pine Gap and Nurrungar. It was a visit by the Opposition's foreign affairs and defence committee, something that I suspect the Government's parliamentary back bench committee has not bothered to undertake. In fact, I know that to be the case, because we were the first parliamentary party delegation to make the effort to go to the bases, to inspect them, and to talk to the people, both Australian and American, who work there. When I came back from that visit I issued a press release, in the first paragraph of which I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Hawke Government was more open and frank with the Parliament and the Australian people as to the role and functions of the Australia-US Joint Facilities, it might receive more public support for the bases. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we now have the Prime Minister's statement claiming the Government is more open and frank and therefore seeking greater public support for the bases. Unfortunately, one does not learn a lot from reading the Prime Minister's statement. That is consistent with his approach some four years ago, in 1984, when he last put down a statement on the bases. At that time he said he would make a ministerial statement that would fulfil the Government's commitment to `inform the public of the general purpose and function of the joint Australia-United States facilities'. As honourable senators would be aware, the Prime Minister's subsequent statement added nothing to what was already on the public record. A somewhat similar situation applied when we visited the bases. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) gave permission, as is necessary, for us to visit the bases, but when we got there we were told by the officials that unfortunately they were not permitted by the Australian Government to tell us more than was already on the public record. I might say that that was somewhat embarrassing to the American officials as they have a somewhat different attitude to these things from the Australian Government. They were prepared to brief more fully but were restrained from doing so by the Australian Government. So the Australian Government restrained American officials from informing Australian parliamentarians of the functions of these bases. That was a truly astonishing situation. It was unusual for the Americans because, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the United States Senate Armed Services Committee and other congressional committees are briefed fully on establishments such as these. We have an illusion of openness by the Australian Government but really it has a continuing mushroom mentality. I do not think that is in the best interests of democracy in this country, because it is still my view that if the Australian people were taken into greater confidence in relation to these bases and were told of their purpose and the part they play in ensuring peace for this country, suspicions would be put to rest and there would be greater community support for the role that they play.</PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the books of, say, Dr Desmond Ball and refers to Pine Gap, one finds they say that the base acts as a giant vacuum cleaner, able to draw up telemetry radar, radio and other electronic data from the nations which might pose a threat to the Western alliance. I said in my press release that if that is the case, why not admit it. In actual fact, what the Prime Minister has done in this statement is almost admit that. He does not go quite as far as that detail, although it could hardly be called detail, but he admits the intelligence function of Pine Gap. How dramatic! Clearly, the intelligence function is appreciated by the Australian people. I disagree totally with Senator Vallentine when she says that the Australian community, if brought into the Government's confidence, would not support an intelligence gathering capacity of that nature. Clearly they would. The Australian people would be able to better understand how the facility contributes to verification of arms control agreements and how it contributes to ensuring peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The satellite ground station at Nurrungar is described by Dr Ball in his books as principally in early warning installation monitoring the energy emission of missiles. That is what the Prime Minister now tells us, dramatically, is the purpose of the Nurrungar base. Why then in the five years that the Government has been in office have Mr Hawke and his Government not been prepared to take the Australian people into the Government's confidence? In relation to Nurrungar, it is clear that Australians would support anything that Australia might do which acts as a disincentive to a nuclear first strike. Clearly, a base that monitors emissions from missiles, that can record missiles taking off from other places in the world, does act as an early warning installation and, therefore, would be supported by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We came back from that visit, which was informative in some ways but disappointing in others, applauding the people who work on the bases and make a commitment to Australia and the United States. In the case of the United States, men and women work a long way from their families but, nevertheless, they recognise the contribution that they make towards our peace and security as well as the peace and security of their homeland and the peace and security of other friendly nations. We recognised and applauded their work. We recognised the role that the bases can play towards peace and security. We were pleased to have been informed by Dr Ball but were disappointed that the Australian Government was not prepared to let us into its confidence. I look at this statement as a small step forward in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In the eyes of the Opposition, the bases are obviously to be supported. In our view they are an important contribution to peace and security. It follows logically, but after the last two contributions it is worth restating it, that the Opposition supports the Western alliance. It supports a recognition that peace and security must be looked at in global terms, that there is no security in isolation, and it recognises these bases as part of our contribution to that wider Western alliance. It is an alliance of like democracies of nations throughout the world that want to protect the sort of freedom and security which we treasure so much in this country. The bases in their intelligence gathering and early warning roles are, in our view, a modest contribution by Australia but nevertheless a contribution that should be supported. We have always said that when a country becomes part of a wider alliance with nuclear powers there are risks associated with that. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, this Parliament recognised that in its 1982 report on threats to Australia and on other occasions. Nevertheless, I am pleased to say that the Parliament then, and more recently in its important paper on disarmament, generally recognised that there is a greater risk in not being part of an alliance and in trying to go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly we have immediate defence responsibilities. We must be regionally capable of defending ourselves and regionally capable of providing deterrents. But beyond that it is clear that when we talk about security against nuclear weapon powers and security against superpowers, we need support. That is nothing to be ashamed of. It is simply a fact of our economic position in the world and it is also part of the fact that we have no wish in this country to go down the nuclear weapon path. We in the Opposition support the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We support efforts that are made to prevent horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons and we support efforts that are made against vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating the statement tonight in what I think can be described as exciting times. I refer to the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. The treaty seeks to reduce the number of intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe and the Far East. The Opposition believes that that is a wonderful achievement and looks forward to the process continuing in the much more difficult area of the strategic arms reduction talks. When we can achieve reductions in strategic weapons whilst maintaining deterrents, we believe that we will be in a safer world. Therefore, we support contributions towards that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we recognise that the West cannot safely enter into reduction agreements without adequate verification. Even this Government claims to recognise that fact. In other words, we recognise that the West cannot safely reduce the number of nuclear weapons unless adequate strength and commitment are maintained. I am pleased to say that through the leadership of the United States, under President Reagan, which I am happy to acknowledge, that strength has been maintained and, in many ways, increased while at the same time the world has made the first positive contribution to a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons. We want that process to continue, but it can continue only if there is verification. Australia should play its part, can play its part and does play its part through these joint defence facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is this an exciting time in the world in terms of the reduction, and the potential for greater reduction, in nuclear weapons, but also, as someone recently said, there are signs that peace is breaking out all over. We have had a settlement at last of the Iran-Iraq dispute-it is great to see that the United Nations has been so active in that settlement-a dispute settled after eight bloody years. We have seen the Soviet Union prepare for and commence its pull-out of Afghanistan, something that we have no hesitation in applauding and which can provide peace and security eventually for the Afghan people. I acknowledge again the role the United Nations has played in that regard. We are now seeing an agreement between South Africa, Angola and Cuba on Namibia, something that some of us have been looking for for a long time. Whilst we are still a fair way off achieving a total resolution of that dispute, the withdrawal of troops and a position in which to maintain security, there is nevertheless real hope. Perhaps for the first time there is now real hope of a settlement in the 10-year old Kampuchean conflict. We see that the Soviet Union and China are now looking towards their first summit meeting next year since Khrushchev went to Beijing in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA> We are living all of a sudden in exciting times when peace seems to be breaking out all over. Our responsibility now is to ensure that Australia continues to do its bit to enable those agreements to be brought home to final fruition and to provide a more secure world for all of us. A safer and more secure world will happen only with deterrents and with verification, but if they can be provided, as Australia is providing them through these bases, there may be, for the first time in a long period, a redirection of resources towards those who are in poverty and who have a real economic need, rather than continually into ever increasing military spending. That is something that we would applaud. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, it would be remiss of me if I did not mention at least three areas in which I feel that the Australian Government, the Hawke Government, is not playing its part in contributing to the type of goals that I have just been putting to the Senate. Firstly, I have made it clear that we have a responsibility to maintain through this period an adequate defence, particularly in relation to regional affairs. What is obvious, again as a result of the report of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in the last week or two, is the appalling state of Australia's defence forces. Mr Acting Deputy President, this is something which you spoke of in greater detail earlier tonight and it should be repeated over and over again. I am, of course, referring to the report on wastage, the rather frightening level of resignation from our defence forces. That is not consistent with maintaining peace and Australia's regional or wider responsibilities. Regrettably, it is happening primarily, I believe, because of a feeling within the defence forces that their efforts are not appreciated, that they are not recognised by this Government, that they are not regarded with the same pride with which for example, the United States forces are regarded by the United States community at large. The sooner the Australian community-it would be easier if it were led by this Government in the right direction-properly appreciates and recognises the service of Australia's military personnel, men and women, and rewards them accordingly not only in monetary terms but also in the other ways in which we show respect in this country, the better off we will be. As I said, leadership from Government is totally lacking in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I wish to refer to was also mentioned by you, Mr Acting Deputy President; that is, damage to the alliance. Evidence that Australia is not a reliable partner in the alliance undermines our security position and there was no more classic demonstration to our friends of our unreliability than what happened recently when the Australian Government invited our friends' and allies' ships and naval officers to Australia as part of our Bicentenary. When they got here, at least in some Australian ports, the unions refused to allow the ships to dock and refused to allow those sailors, the guests of Australia, onto Australia's shores. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne says, members of the so-called peace movement spat on the sailors as they walked ashore. But what did the Australian Government do to ensure that we behaved as hosts should to those we invite to this country-our allies in the defence of Australia? It said that it could do nothing because otherwise it would offend the unions. That is a national disgrace and it undermines the strength of the alliance. It shows to our partners that we are not reliable and it is perhaps the greatest indictment of all of the Hawke Government for its lack of contribution in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last concern that I have-I hope that to some extent it will now be put to rest by the agreement for a new 10-year lease on these bases-is the willingness of the Hawke Government, Mr Hawke and his trade Ministers, to use the bases as tools in trade negotiations; in other words, to put Australia's security assets up as bargaining tools in negotiations for access in trade. I hope that that is something that the next Australian government, the coalition, would never do, because it sends to our partners and to our allies totally the wrong message-the message that we do not take security and defence seriously, that we do not recognise the contribution that other nations, our friends and allies, play in our defence-leading to a concern on their part that if the crunch ever comes we will not be prepared to play our part in their defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reiterating the Opposition's support for the alliance and Australia's contribution to that alliance by hosting the intelligence gathering facilities on our shores. I am pleased that the Government has taken the small step of taking the Australian people into its confidence in explaining the purpose of these bases. I hope that they will long remain, that the alliance will remain strong and that Australia will gain the benefits of peace and security that can come therefrom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) revealed to the people of Australia that the Government had extended for a further 10 years the agreement covering the leases at the so-called joint bases at Pine Gap and Nurrungar and had extended the amount of notice required for termination of these agreements from one year to three years. It is very kind indeed of the Prime Minister to give us the opportunity of debating the subject of the bases after the Government has signed the agreement! That is, it seems to me, akin to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. In spite of this debate, of course, these agreements cannot be revoked by Parliament, so I wonder what we are all doing here tonight talking about them. I feel that it is a great pity the Government did not allow the debate to proceed before any decision was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hawke also announced that there would be greater involvement of Australian personnel in the operation of the bases. There could be less, I would suggest, if Mr Hawke wants to call them joint facilities. However, that is probably the only thing in Mr Hawke's announcement that I could commend. This is the latest step in the Government's refusal to consult with people and their elected representatives. It is maintaining the extraordinary secrecy surrounding the installations and what the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, says gives us no hope that the secrecy will be broken down. It is continuing to keep Australian people in the dark about the real functions of the bases and it is continuing to misrepresent the bases as being essential to Australia's security interests and to the broader interests of global security. Nurrungar is officially known as the joint defence space communications station. It is, as the Prime Minister points out, the ground station for the eastern hemisphere early warning satellite of the US defense support program (DSP). The Prime Minister tells us that Nurrungar plays a vital role in helping to prevent nuclear war and that Australians can be glad that we help to operate this vital facility. I would suggest that gladness is not the sentiment Australians should be expressing. Rather, they should be and are concerned and even outraged at the siting of such a facility on Australian soil. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister would have us believe that the DSPs missile launch detection capability continues to have a deterrence function and that the satellite mounted nuclear detonation, or NUDET, sensors, which transmit data through Nurrungar to the United States are also essential for arms verification. Recent commentary has indicated that NUDET sensors no longer play a necessary role in arms control verification. The US is deploying advanced nuclear detonation sensors on its new navigation satellite system (NAVSTAR) which, when fully deployed, will mean that nuclear explosion data will no longer have to be relayed through Nurrungar. Why are we extending the lease for Nurrungar? Furthermore, the development by the United States of satellite to satellite laser cross-link technology in conjunction with a mobile ground terminal (MGT) system will mean that Nurrungar will play a much less critical role in terms of missile early warning. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that both NAVSTAR and the cross-link MGT systems are likely to be fully operational within the new few years, thus rendering Nurrungar unnecessary in terms of the Government's justification for its existence, one might question why the Government has extended the leases on this base. I suggest that these capabilities contribute directly to the US nuclear strategy. They clearly play an essential part in American first strike capability, something that the Prime Minister managed to avoid any reference to in his statement yesterday. It is this contribution which the Pentagon views as the most important one Nurrungar can make. As Senator Vallentine has already stated, in 1982 General Rudolph, in testimony to the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said that NUDET was a war-fighting capability. Similarly, General Hartinger, Commander of the US Air Force Space Command which runs the DSP program, has stated flatly that the DSP is tied into the war-fighting structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that Nurrungar is part of DSP program, we can only assume that it too is tied into this same war-fighting structure. The nuclear war-fighting strategy of the United States, as opposed to a deterrence policy which involves the development of a counterforce attack capability, is considered to be dangerous and destabilising. So, therefore, are the installations which support these capabilities. Yet in 1984 Mr Hawke, in his June speech to the House of Representatives to which he made reference yesterday, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The notion of a nuclear first strike . . . would be destabilising were it to gain credence. </PARA>
<PARA>He also indicated that his Government's voice would be directed towards supporting doctrines which eschewed moving beyond stable deterrence towards postures more appropriate to waging nuclear war. In 1984 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, also argued against the doctrine of nuclear war fighting in a much publicised pamphlet entitled Uranium, the Joint Facilities, Disarmament and Peace. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> To prepare to fight a limited war . . . is in fact to make nuclear war more thinkable and therefore more possible. </PARA>
<PARA>There is, clearly, an inconsistency between the Hawke Government's public opposition to nuclear war-fighting strategies and the joint facilities' involvement with those strategies. Notwithstanding the Government's almost total silence on this issue since then, it would appear that it is tacitly collaborating in a strategy to which it is officially opposed. The Australian people have a right to know the Government's stance on this issue and to what extent they are being unwittingly involved in a globally destabilising strategy. Des Ball's 1987 study on Nurrungar reveals that a massive database on the boost phase characteristics of Soviet missile launchers was handed to the US Strategic Defense Initiative-or Star Wars-Organisation in 1983, and it is almost certainly the case that data is still being collected and being handed to the SDIO. Australia is, therefore, still involved with US SDI research, to which the Prime Minister has publicly expressed his opposition. In 1985 he said that SDI `is not an initiative as far as the Australian Government is concerned that receives our endorsement'. Furthermore, Prime Minister Hawke also said that he had been given an unqualified assurance by Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, that none of the joint facilities had any role in the research undertaken under SDI. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has now finally acknowledged Pine Gap as an intelligence data collection facility; in other words, a spy base whose major role is espionage. We in the peace movement have known that for a very long time. The facility is run by the Central Intelligence Agency and successive American officers in charge of Pine Gap have been senior officers of the CIA. Its highly sensitive electronic espionage activities are shrouded in secrecy, and under the present agreement will continue to be shrouded in secrecy. The Prime Minister stated yesterday that the intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes importantly to the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements, which is vital to the arms control process, through the interception of missile telemetric data-that is, the radio signals transmitted by a rocket during its flight. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as other speakers today have noted, it has been estimated that only 40 per cent of Pine Gap's time is spent on verification, and Professor Ball has said that the use of the ryholite signals intelligence (SIGINT) satellites for verification was almost an afterthought. Pine Gap is not the only means available to the United States for the interception of telemetric data. The primary role of Pine Gap is not arms control verification but electronic spying. Pine Gap's most important role is in the processing of information gathered by the SIGINT satellites and transmitting that information to the United States. The facility is able to intercept telephonic and radio-microwave communication from the Soviet Union and China, as well as elsewhere in the world, and is involved in CIA covert satellite communications programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in respect of this intelligence gathering and claims that Pine Gap is essential to Australia's intelligence, we might ask how much of the intelligence relationship between the United States and Australia is dependent on the joint facilities and how much of the intelligence that comes through the joint facilities is made available to Australia. We do not know. Furthermore, we should ask what control Australia has over the use to which the spy facilities are put. It is reported, for example, that in 1984-85 Pine Gap was used by the Americans to spy on Greece. I am sure that Mr Hawke's luncheon guest of today, Mr Christos Sartzetakis, would not be pleased if this were to happen again. I would certainly concur that verification is an important part of the process of arms control as a first step in the process of disarmament. But Australia has verification specialists of its own and I would argue that, if Pine Gap is an essential verification facility, it should be only that and it should be staffed solely by Australians as part of an international monitoring and verification system. We have scientists here in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and in the universities who are specialists in image and signal processing, aperture synthesis radar and seismological reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint facilities increase the likelihood of Australia being a nuclear target. In March 1978 the Director of Scientific and Technical Intelligence of the Joint Intelligence Organisation stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot determine the priorities the USSR attaches to targets in Australia, but joint US-Australian facilities would probably rank high. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation has not changed since then. In 1984 the Prime Minister admitted in a speech to the House of Representatives that hosting the facilities does bring with it some degree of added risk of nuclear attack. In fact, the Government has assessed this risk as being so high that the Natural Disasters Organisation is already preparing evacuation plans for Pine Gap, North West Cape and Nurrungar. The presence of United States controlled facilities continues to act against the development of an independent and self-reliant foreign policy. They make it difficult for any Australian government to move to extricate Australian policy from association with and dependence upon the United States. Futhermore, it makes more difficult the development of initiatives for regional cooperation when our Pacific and Asian neighbours are reluctant to enter into greater cooperative relationships with us while Australia hosts US ground stations from which the US may spy on the internal affairs of those neighbours. Removal of US installations would not only remove a major obstacle to greater regional cooperation but would also allow Australia to pursue a much more independent foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> One should ask whether the Australian Government is able to guarantee to the Australian people that it is fully apprised of all the operational, technical and strategic details of each of the facilities to ensure that Australian interests are not compromised. Earlier Prime Ministers admitted that they did not know the full story about the functions of Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Is Mr Hawke able to convince the Australian public that he and his Government are fully aware of all details of these installations and that they have effective political control over their operation and maintenance?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley indicated this morning in a radio interview that the Government had a distinct view that Australian issues of sovereignty were important and that those views were blended with the Government's favourable attitude towards the joint facilities to produce the agreements which we are debating now. I can only say that, if this represents the Government's interpretation of the interests of Australian sovereignty, Mr Beazley should consult his dictionary in a little more depth. The extension of the leases on these facilities perpetuates the derogation of Australian sovereignty to a superpower whose political and strategic interests are not and should not become those of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In his 1984 speech, the Prime Minister also indicated that the United States Administration had been consulted on his statement about Pine Gap and Nurrungar and had agreed to it being issued. I wonder whether yesterday's statement was also cleared by the US Administration. Surely this brings the United States influence in respect of the so-called joint facilities into the very heart of Australian democracy and sovereignty-the parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I wish to say that the Australian public has a fundamental right to be told as much as possible about the purposes and functions of these installations. There should be an open and informed debate and we should be told what is involved in the bases, what programs the bases are part of, what sort of information is being provided to the United States, what the consequences of that involvement are to Australia, and what the implications are for the questions of global stability and nuclear war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to speak on the parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the joint defence facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar, which was delivered yesterday, 22 November. Mr Hawke said in his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The changes we are making reflect the commitment of both governments to maintaining and strengthening our long standing partnership of these joint facilities . . . On 6 June 1985 in this place I made the first detailed public statement about the roles of the facilities . . . My remarks today, which will in some respect go beyond that earlier statement, are made with the same conviction. </PARA>
<PARA>But in fact very little information is being made available to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Geoff Pryor, a very talented cartoonist for the Canberra Times, said it all this morning in a cartoon captioned `Mr Hawke reveals all'. What we see in that cartoon is a familiar white dome labelled `Pine Gap' that is lifted to reveal underneath yet another white dome. The most interesting revelation is how much obfuscation and disinformation have been provided by Government speakers in earlier debates and in answers to questions. I would like to compare the remarks made by Senator Collins on 21 October 1987 with those of the Prime Minister yesterday. Senator Collins, in talking about the joint facilities, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The personnel who run the bases are divided about half and half; there are about 250 Australian personnel and about 250 American personnel . . . It is in truth a joint facility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to compare that with what the Prime Minister said yesterday in his statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Whereas only a handful of Australian Government personnel was directly involved in the central work of the facility in the 1970s and early 1980s-contributing less than 10 per cent of the staff there-the proportion is scheduled to rise to about 30 per cent over the next two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA>That tells a somewhat different story from that which was told by Senator Collins. In fact, the Prime Minister's statement contains little that was new to informed newspaper readers. It tacitly acknowledges the previous withholding of information. It also acknowledges a lack of Australian control. The Prime Minister said in respect of Nurrungar:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians constitute some 40 per cent of the staff in the key operational areas, and will now take a role in management with the appointment of the senior Australian officer there as deputy commander. Like his counterpart at Pine Gap, he will share responsibility with the commander for the management of the station and its physical security. </PARA>
<PARA>So increased Australian control is promised and there are to be new Australian deputy commanders at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. These officers will merely share responsibility for the management of the station and its physical security. In fact, that is like being promoted from janitor to night watchman. </PARA>
<PARA> The real purpose of the `facilities' is still nothing to do with Australia, unless Australia is to be part of US nuclear war fighting strategies. Only if this is the case are the facilities in any way `joint'. We reject the subordination of Australia to foreign bases, for that is what they are. More importantly, it is foreign domination of our foreign policy. It is dangerous and humiliating for Australia to be forced to accept the nuclear policy of another country. It is interesting to note what John Howard had to say about Mr Hawke in 1976. He said of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he signed a joint statement, along with many other people identified with the left wing of politics, in which he warned against foreign military bases on our soil as being detrimental to our safety, and called for an independent and non-aligned Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is it that Mr Hawke is now so pleased to see us fundamentally under United States control? The Prime Minister said only yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends that honourable members will have an opportunity to debate this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Why then was this new agreement with the US signed last week? The Government has locked Australia into another 10 years of being a nuclear target on behalf of someone else and then it has the gall to permit us to debate it. Why were we not allowed to debate it before the signing of the agreement? Tonight Senator Vallentine made us aware, as have other senators, that polls show an increasing antagonism to bases and ship visits. They show that 58 per cent of young people and 50 per cent of all Australian women oppose these bases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claims to have told us all that it is good for us. He has said that everything has been done in the name of `verification'. But there is hardly any mention in the statement of deterrence. Does that mean that deterrence, which was always implausible, is now unfashionable amongst the hawks? What has he told us? He has told us that Nurrungar is a groundstation used for controlling satellites in the United States defence support program. Nurrungar, says the Prime Minister, plays a `quite fundamental role in preventing nuclear war'. He tells us that Pine Gap is a satellite groundstation whose function is to collect intelligence data. He claims that intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes importantly to the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. The Prime Minister suggested that this time he was going to reveal to the Australian people the truth about the bases. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Australian Government has a long and dishonourable tradition-in the worst tradition, incidentally, of the United States Government-of telling untruths, half-truths and deliberate distortions of the truth about the bases. In June 1984, Mr Hawke `revealed all'; that is, he told the Parliament the whole truth and nothing but the truth. He said that they were not military bases but that they were there just for the benign purpose of nuclear test ban monitoring and non-proliferation. But let me quote what was said by another Prime Minister of Australia in a speech recorded on pages 1519 to 1523 of Hansard of 4 May 1977. Gough Whitlam said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is increasing and profoundly disturbing evidence that foreign espionage and intelligence activities are being practised in Australia on a large scale . . . it cannot be ignored by Parliament. The manipulation of unions, the financing of political parties, the deception over the CIA, and the activities of foreign installations on our soil all affect Australia's independence and sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>So what has changed? We have one change-we now have a Prime Minister, also from the Australian Labor Party, who does not query the covert activities on Australia's soil and in Australia's skies but makes them welcome and attempts by blandishment and bluster to con the Australian people into believing that all is well. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the bases are not benign and they are not primarily concerned with the peace of the world. The bases are part of the nuclear strategy of the United States. There is no need for me to go through the familiar history of the perception of nuclear war and its horrible acronyms: from missile gaps to SDI-strategic defence initiative to MAD-mutual assured destruction. We are now in the dubious and frightening phase of preparation for a winnable nuclear war. No sane person believes that there would be such a thing. Nuclear wars have no winners, yet we know that the strategic planners of the Pentagon and-we do not know but we can guess-the nuclear war planners of the Soviet Union are working on the scenario of a winnable nuclear war. However, the Prime Minister did not mention this in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have known since the 1970s that Pine Gap has been a `facility' of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as Senator Dunn mentioned earlier. The Prime Minister failed to mention that the targets which are observed by the Pine Gap satellites are chosen and approved by the United States National Reconnaissance Office and approved by the National Reconnaissance Executive Committee, which is chaired by the Director of the CIA. None of the Committee members are Australians or have any allegiance or responsibility towards Australia. The personnel involved, the satellites and the bases themselves serve the purposes of United States nuclear strategists. </PARA>
<PARA> Like nuclear warships in our harbours the bases are themselves prime nuclear targets, and that is acknowledged. The best security for Australia lies in removing the bases. The bases attract the attention of the very nuclear weapons which the Prime Minister tells us they will protect us from. If the bases are really about verification, we should either run them ourselves or hand them over to, say, the United Nations to be used for international peacekeeping</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement made yesterday in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, with regard to the joint facilities that Australia has developed with the United States of America is to be welcomed, even if it represents for the Prime Minister a belated conversion to the correct viewpoint. It is well and truly worth remembering that it was one R. J. L. Hawke who, along with the present Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs Child, and the Labor member for Hughes, Mr Tickner, and the Labor member for Sydney, Mr Baldwin, appended signatures to an anti-ANZUS and anti-joint facilities advertisement in the National Times of September 1976. I was hoping that when I participated in this debate this evening Senator Gietzelt would also be present because he also signed that advertisement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the only member of the Australian Labor Party who has spoken in this chamber on this very important issue was the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, who spoke for 54 seconds at the commencement of the debate this evening. He tabled the Prime Minister's report and he asked that the Prime Minister's speech yesterday in the House of Representatives be incorporated. How pathetic that the Government of this nation, on this issue, which is of paramount importance, has the audacity to take only 54 seconds in this Senate on such a very important issue. I think it shows the commitment of Labor members to such an important issue, and we saw that in the press today where obviously different factions within the Labor Party have taken particular views on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The position in the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday is supported by the Opposition and, in particular, the conclusion of the 10-year non-terminable periods for both Pine Gap and Nurrungar, with three-year periods of notice required, is most welcome. The extension plus the lengthy notice period protects these important facilities against the possible lunacy of some future Labor regime which might revert to the traditional anti-American and anti-alliance stance that we have come to expect from much of the Labor Party. Today, most heirs to that position are to be found in the Australian Democrats and the Independent senators Vallentine and Dunn. Doubtlessly, they will, as they have done already, entertain the Senate with their standard `why the bases must go' speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard tonight from Senator Vallentine a whole reef of claims that public opinion was shifting, that public opinion had changed and that it was standing solidly behind the viewpoint that she has been peddling around Australia for some five years or so. However, she did not give any data on which to base the claim that there is a shift in public opinion on foreign bases. Where is the basis for her claim? No doubt it is some dubious and specially contextured public opinion that is being put forward by Senator Vallentine and the peace movement, rather like putting out a public opinion poll with questions asked in such a way that the answers that flow are predictable. I am sure that, if we were to put out a similar public opinion poll asking the people of Australia how they would reflect on ANZUS and the relationships and how they felt that Australian and American interests ought to be reconciled, we would have a stable majority well and truly in favour of that particular viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the bases-more correctly called the joint facilities-are not going anywhere, and Senators Vallentine and Dunn will have to wear that. They are here, they are permanent. I would hope that the fact that there is now a firm contract-a 10-year commitment with a 3-year expiry clause at the end of it-guarantees us at least 13 years without the necessity for this particular argument. It is going to make it very difficult for Senators Vallentine and Dunn to survive politically anywhere for 13 years let alone continue with the trite arguments that they have been putting forward. We are indeed fortunate that the joint facilities are here to stay. They not only provide concrete evidence of our continued commitment to the American alliance but also in their own right play an important part in the maintenance of world peace. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister, with the consent of our American friends, has now revealed, the Nurrungar facility is an important part of the defence support program early warning satellite system. Early warning of nuclear attack is a vital component of any deterrent strategy, and the objective of American nuclear deterrent strategy is to ensure that a nuclear war is never fought-to deter the Soviets and thereby maintain peace. Thus, Nurrungar helps maintain the world nuclear peace and is deserving of our support. </PARA>
<PARA> Pine Gap, for its part, we now know makes a significant contribution to the West's strategic intelligence gathering capabilities. Just as early warning is vital, so the collection of strategic intelligence is necessary to preserve a stable regime of balance between the superpowers. Good intelligence is an important confidence building measure: if the superpowers know what is going on, they are less likely to make errors leading to unintended nuclear exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note the increasing participation of Australians at the senior levels of control in both facilities. There has been an Australian deputy commander at North West Cape since 1974 and now there are to be Australians in equivalent positions both at Nurrungar and Pine Gap. This fact, coupled with the increases in Australian numbers at the upper levels of both facilities, must surely give the lie to those who still claim that these are US bases and not genuinely joint facilities. I am proud to represent the Northern Territory in this place. I am very much aware of the importance of Pine Gap to the town of Alice Springs. The economic and the social interrelationship is genuine and it is appreciated. There are some 460 staff at Pine Gap. I am sure that with the extended families and people working in associated service industries, there are much more than 2,000 people together making this vital contribution to the central Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The only people that stand out in the crowd are the loonies-the people that drift in and out to demonstrate against Pine Gap. They are the people such as Senator Vallentine who make show cases of themselves by tying themselves to fences and trying to climb into Pine Gap in order to get into the newspapers through the exposure of putting taxpayers to the expense of having to put them in gaol. What an insult to the taxpayers of Australia that we have a representative in this Senate who carries on in such a stupid and idiotic manner to put such a view point across in this community. To have Senators Vallentine and Dunn and a number of Australian Democrat senators come in here and put up pappy, pointless and often stupid arguments annoys most of the people in the Northern Territory. They cannot understand why these people cannot express themselves properly in all of the proper forums. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement yesterday by the Prime Minister shows that at the moment his views are in control of the Labor Party's decision making processes, but it would be a foolish person who thought that the Labor Party might not one day come again under left wing control. By contrast, the conservative parties have never wavered in their support for the alliance with America or for the joint facilities. This is something the people should always bear in mind when evaluating the present position of the Labor Party on these important issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak ever so briefly on the parliamentary statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the joint defence facilities. Of course, it comes as no surprise to us that the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn condemn the very sensible agreement and negotiations. Their view is that there should be no such bases in Australia at any price. If they had their way they would impose and inflict upon the Australian community unilateral disarmament. From my observations it seems that these people think they have a mortgage on concern for peace in spite of the truth, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two groups. There are those that are essentially opposed to the joint facilities. They believe in unilateral disarmament. They are inevitably anti-American in their outlook and muted in their criticism of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Then there are those other fellow travellers who are seduced, more than anything else I suspect sadly out of ignorance, into the view that the reduction of any facilities means an increase in peace. What enrages me more than anything else is that there are those who claim to be part of the peace movement-whatever the peace movement is, the name in itself is outlandish because it claims a mortgage on a concern for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reflects, as Senator Tambling did, upon their conduct in recent times one sees that, in their case, their peace comes at the price of disruption for everybody else. That does not seem to matter to Senator Vallentine who causes the distraction of 30 police officers from their normal functions and duties in Western Australia to have to attend to her misbehaviour at Fremantle wharf and finally arrest her and take her away. It does not seem to worry her that while those 30 policemen were distracted from their normal duties there were five sexual assaults in one day in Western Australia, several hundred break and enters, several embezzlements, hundreds of thefts and probably a number of fatal motor car accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that there is a shortage of police in Western Australia. The police force is undermanned. But to exacerbate that problem, the police find themselves having to go down to Fremantle wharf to protect ordinary decent Australian citizens who go to that wharf to welcome the Americans, the French, the Italians or the British and to protect those people from the conduct of the demonstrators who then have the cheek to tell us that they are there for peace. They are not for peace; they are for disruption; they are for chaos; they are for breaking the law. The peace they want is a peace that suits them-a peace at any price for them, but nobody else's peace. </PARA>
<PARA> What enrages me is that by and large those people know what they are calling for when they call for unilateral disarmament. They know what they are doing when they offer up their glib slogans. The sadness is that they seduce so many other decent people into believing that their cause has some virtue. Of course, from the outset it has no integrity, never mind virtue. It is those people that, for their own perverted causes, their own perverted reasons, perhaps for the primeval arousal of demonstrations, risk and jeopardise the security and safety of ordinary Australian citizens and perhaps all people of the world. I find their conduct hypocritical, sanctimonious and self-righteous. I cannot help but observe that there was deafening silence in this Parliament from these people when the most substantial agreement entered into in modern time in respect to warfare was concluded. The intermediate-range nuclear force agreement for the first time removed one class of nuclear weapons. Had they risen in integrity, they would have been compelled to observe that it was the location of American missiles in Western Europe that caused the Soviet Union to withdraw its SS20 missiles. For the first time the Soviet Union was threatened, and those peace people would have had to acknowledge that the ratbags, the rabble and the deviants that occupied Greenham Common, for instance, for months and months suddenly found themselves to be without a cause. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the location of the American missiles at Greenham Common which finally brought the Soviets to the negotiating table, and they had to agree to the intermediate nuclear forces agreement. That was but the beginning of a scaling-down of nuclear weapons in the world. It was the beginning of agreements which would include verification and the resurrection of the strategic arms reduction talks. This was all brought about by the Americans' determination to ensure that peace would be brought about by force and strength-not by weakness, not by capitulation, and least of all by unilateral disarmament, as these peace people would have us undertake. The reason we heard nothing when the most substantial agreement had been entered into was that the people would have had to concede that the very premise of their arguments was wrong. They knew they were wrong. They did not have the decency, integrity or honesty to stand up and say, `We were wrong. Peace comes through strength, not though weakness'. They were absolutely silent on that agreement, and to me that was a statement of their conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have it that these people would have removed from Australian soil Nurrungar, Pine Gap and the North West Cape facilities. It ought to be understood that those facilities are not there to serve the singular interests, the selfish or sectional interests, of the United States. The facilities are there because Australian governments, both past and present, have wanted them there-as they will presumably want them in the future-and because the overwhelming majority of ordinary, decent Australian people want security and certainty for their future, not weakness and unilateral disarmament which totally destabilises the balance of competing forces in this world. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have been moved to ask before, why is it that, whenever there is a debate in this Parliament on the question of nuclear forces, the criticisms that invariably come from the Australian Democrats, from Senator Vallentine-if she is here and not in gaol, in New Zealand, in the United States, disrupting the Western Australian State Parliament, or doing other things-and from Senator Dunn are directed exclusively towards the United States? I cannot remember the last time I heard a criticism of the Soviet Union. When have we ever been given a notice of motion condemning the Soviet Union for using the facilities at Cam Ranh Bay? I do not believe that that issue has been raised once in this Parliament, and I suspect that it will not be. These people are essentially anti-American and, in many respects, anti-Australian. They would have these bases removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what these bases do. I refer to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on disarmament and arms control, of which I was one of the authors. The Democrats were invited to appear before and give evidence to that Committee. However, they were conspicuous by their absence. Senator Chipp, as he then was, then Leader of the Australian Democrats, wrote to the Committee and was invited unanimously to appear before the Committee to give evidence and be questioned by those sitting on the committee as to the veracity of his claims and in search of an understanding of his intentions. He was invited not once but on several occasions, but the Democrats, to use bad English, never showed up. When their integrity was on the line, they could not be found. However, let me refer in part to the description of Pine Gap. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> It has high frequency communications to the American Base at Clarke Field in the Philippines, a communications link to the Australian Department of Defence in Canberra and to satellite ground stations . . . which were installed in 1973 and 1980 respectively and connecting to the U.S. DSCS. It has extensive computing facilities and is manned and operated by American and Australian personnel (there are presently some 230 U.S. personnel on the base) . . . its major role is to operate as a ground station for the signals intelligence satellite program known as Rhyolite. The facility is also thought to be used as a receiving and control station-</PARA>
<PARA>and we now know that to be the case-</PARA>
<PARA>for orbiting photographic reconnaissance and electronic intelligence satellites that are operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. The functions of these satellites are described in more detail below. </PARA>
<PARA>Those details are contained in the report, for those honourable senators who wish to read them. Of course, Nurrungar is operated under the control of the United States Air Force. I think it was Senator Hill who touched on the fact that it is our Government, or at least the Labor Government-I claim no ownership of it-that is so reluctant to provide information to the Australian people, which, by and large, is readily available to the United States. The report indicates:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent budget estimates which were provided to the Appropriations Committee of the United States' House of Representatives, and declassified research and development summaries, indicate that Nurrungar is part of the United States Defense Support Program (DSP)--</PARA>
<PARA>which, of course, we now know-</PARA>
<PARA>or Program Code 647. The DSP is an on-going classified space program consisting of two ground control and readout stations located at Nurrungar and Colorado in the United States that receive data from early warning satellites, process the data and automatically present it to the U.S. National Command Authorities and military commanders for decision-making purposes. The DSP satellites are also thought to carry nuclear detonation detection equipment that can be used to monitor and gather specific data on Soviet, Chinese and French nuclear tests. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the base has the capacity to gather information on the activities of nations that are involved in nuclear arms. I think that, by any measure, any base or facility that monitors activities and ensures that agreements are complied with, which by any measure is essential to the entering of any agreement, can only be of value to this country and to the Western world and give legitimacy to agreements entered into. I think it was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who had the sense, with his born-again enlightenment after he managed to discharge some of the bigotry baggage that he brought into this Parliament, to concede that a major justification for retaining the joint facilities in Australia is that they contribute to international stability by helping to deter nuclear war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The removal or substantial downgrading of the functions of the bases can only hinder the efforts of the United States to maintain an effective and stable deterrence and it would therefore only increase the risk of nuclear conflict. I ask: how can there be any compelling logic for the removal of a base whose essential function is to provide deterrence? What is the motive, the reason or the commonsense? I have sought to probe the minds of these people to begin to discover if there is any logical sequence in their thinking, but I have failed. There seems to be no logical conclusion. I am even prepared to put aside their prejudices and their bigotry, but still I have to say there is no logic in why they do not want a deterrence, why they do not want stability in agreements. Of course the joint facilities contribute to global stability in a number of ways. Firstly, the signals monitoring and early warning functions of Pine Gap and Nurrungar make it impossible for the Soviet Union to launch a surprise nuclear attack against the United States without risking detection and subsequent retaliation against Soviet cities. I would have thought that would be a reasonable ground for having such a facility. It prevents the Soviet Union from launching a surprise first strike against the United States and its facilities. In other words, the bases provide the United States with a retaliatory capacity which, in itself, is a deterrence to the Soviet Union, and therefore we have stability; quod erat demonstrandum. Yet the Australian Democrats tell us that we ought to be destabilising this agreement. I find that absolutely amazing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The retaliatory forces of the United States include, of course, the submarine launched ballistic missiles, the SLBMs as they are called, which are located in the Pacific and Indian oceans. These forces by and large are almost exclusively immune to a pre-emptive Soviet strike. For that reason only a very limited number of submarines are needed to wreak unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union in the event that it strikes first.</PARA>
<PARA> So by providing secure and reliable communications for the ballistic missile equipped nuclear powered submarine fleet, the North West Cape base, for instance, is providing a stabilising contribution to the global balance by enhancing basic deterrence. The satellite surveillance and early warning systems which operate through Pine Gap and Nurrungar also, of course, contribute overall to stability by reducing uncertainty about the Soviet Union's strategic weapons programs and deployments, thereby reducing anxiety about its intentions and alleviating pressures on the part of the United States to maintain its forces at a high alert status. So by having those capacities and having the intelligence and the knowledge of the activities of the Soviet Union, the Americans, our allies-in spite of the protestations of the Democrats-can make a measured and balanced response to the conduct, activities and initiatives of the Soviet Union. It means that it is not required to maintain its forces at a high alert status or perhaps to carry out a pre-emptive strike during a period of tension or crisis. In other words, the intelligence the Americans gather through these bases provides them with an opportunity to have a real understanding of what the Soviets are doing, and ensures in that way that they will not overreact, but nor will they underreact.</PARA>
<PARA> It is Nurrungar in particular which plays the key role in providing an early warning of ballistic missile attacks on the United States, and that is its function. I have referred also to the functioning and the purpose of Pine Gap and, whilst it is not necessarily relevant to this statement, to the function of the North West Cape base. So there is an essential and I would have thought logically compelling reason for these three bases, these three facilities, yet as I say the Democrats would have us remove them. The Democrats and Senator Vallentine claim that they are not unilateralists in terms of disarmament, but of course every time we hear their arguments we realise that they are. They are joined by this happy band of people that talks about using these facilities as bargaining chips with the United States in respect of trade matters. That is an absolutely absurd proposition because we all ought to understand, as I said at the outset, that the bases are not in Australia for the exclusive benefit of the Americans; they are here for our benefit, for our protection and to provide certainty and security for us. In so doing they provide security and certainty for the whole world because, as I say, as long as they provide deterrence they prevent the likelihood of a nuclear war and in many respects they reduce the threshold.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we support the argeement that has been entered into and the negotiations which have taken place. I am of the view that more can be said by this Government in respect of the facilities. Already a great deal more is known, there is a great deal on the record and there is a great deal contained in the disarmament and arms control document which we wrote. If the Government had the courage to put aside the inhibitions of the bureaucrats about providing further information, I suspect it would create more confidence in the Australian people and more certainty and less doubt in their minds. In that way it would dampen the mystique, the mischief and the trouble that the Democrats and Senator Vallentine are able to cause by arguing behind a fog of confusion. I say to anybody in this alleged peace movement that he or she is doing himself or herself and the Australian people a grave disservice by carrying, as I said earlier, the baggage of bigotry around for whatever purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> I find it fascinating that these people call themselves the peace movement. What is the peace movement? These people seem to believe they have a special mortgage on peace. Those in that group who genuinely believe in peace are no different to the vast majority of Australians. In fact when I listen to these people I find their debates the most intellectually barren that we hear in this chamber, because all thinking, sensible and reasonable Australians-of course that culls out some in this chamber-want peace. All we are arguing about is in which direction we go and whether we achieve peace by falling down in an obsequious way, by unilateral disarmament, or whether we achieve peace by strength in the way that Western Europe did not do prior to the Second World War but, as I said before, in the way that the Americans, the British, the Germans and the French did, by agreeing to the location of nuclear weapons on their shores and in their territory, which ultimately caused the Soviets to come to the negotiating table and remove their threatening SS20s and SS22s, which could have struck into the heart of Western Europe in 20 minutes. At that point in time, when there was no threat to them, they refused to move their missiles. The moment they were confronted by missiles from the United States and Western Europe, missiles which they claim could enter their airspace in four minutes flying time, they very quickly found a compelling necessity to enter into negotiations to remove their missiles. As I say, that is peace through strength. That is the direction that this Party supports, and I believe that that has the support of the vast majority of the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there has been agreement that we do not interject on each other and call points of order. I must say that I had great difficulty in restraining myself while Senator Crichton-Browne was speaking, because he used a great number of pejorative epithets which certainly do not, and should not, be applied to those people who take a different path to peace. For somebody who, in his own words, professes to be pursuing a path to peace, his time was more than 50 per cent spent on attacking those who take a different point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of things said by Senator Crichton-Browne also do not follow and were misstatements of fact. Had he listened to what Senator Jenkins had to say, he would have realised that she was certainly not advocating unilateral disarmament. What she was advocating-and what I am certainly advocating-is non-nuclear armed neutrality; that is, to dissociate ourselves from any alliance with any country and to be armed in a non-nuclear way so that we are capable of defending ourselves. That is certainly quite different from unilateral disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne also said that he saw nothing wrong with bases which could act as early warning devices. I see nothing wrong with bases that can act as early warning devices either, except when they are tied in with one of the major potential superpower protagonists in an all-out nuclear conflict. That is what is wrong with them. There is nothing wrong with the function of the base as such, if it were under Australian control or, as Senator Jenkins pointed out, under the control of the United Nations. However, precisely because it is an early warning device, it becomes a nuclear target in the event of a nuclear exchange when that early warning device is unilaterally linked in with one of the potential major protagonists. That is the reason that those of us in the Australian Democrats-and I think I can speak for Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn-are concerned about that association. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to develop the argument as to why we should not support these bases under substantial American control on Australian soil and why we would be much better off, both in terms of peace and in terms of our own defence, if we pursued a policy of armed neutrality based on non-nuclear weapons. Some time ago, when I was first a member of the Senate, I asked a question of Senator Richardson regarding electromagnetic pulse and whether he had any knowledge of this phenomenon. He indicated in his answer that he had no knowledge at all of this phenomenon. If that is extended to other senators, one can assume that perhaps they do not understand one of the basic reasons why a nuclear exchange is likely to escalate into all-out nuclear war extremely rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> When a nuclear weapon is exploded, particularly if that nuclear weapon is exploded high in the atmosphere-perhaps some 200 kilometres above the earth over central Australia-there is a high level pulse of electromagnetic energy which achieves many thousands of volts per metre and which has the effect of knocking out any unprotected communication systems, particularly those which at any point involve the user of transistors. For instance, a single nuclear explosion at about 200 kilometres over Alice Springs would effectively knock out most of the electronic ignition systems in motor cars, would knock out electricity supply systems throughout the whole of Australia, would knock out the telephone system, and would knock out radio and television communications. In fact, it would very rapidly bring the country to a standstill. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason the Americans and, I dare say, the Russians are aware of the fact that one nuclear explosion so placed could effectively prevent communication between the central control facility and the ability to launch retaliatory weapons. It is for that reason, that very clear reason, that at the first warning that a nuclear weapon is on its way the opposite side, whichever that be-whether it be the US or Russia-would tend to want to launch every single nuclear rocket that was available to it simply because, if those weapons were not off the ground, there would be a strong possibility that the retaliatory capability would be lost. In other words, it is a principle of launch on warning. That is the system under which both sides are operating. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and elsewhere we find words to the effect that, because of the enormity of destruction which would follow a nuclear exchange, no nation would sensibly launch a nuclear attack. However, as we all know, the possibility of nuclear attack by accident or the possibility that computers become confused into believing that a nuclear attack is on its way is a far more likely scenario. Therefore, the possibility of a nuclear war becomes considerable. The possibility that that nuclear war would escalate rapidly into wholesale nuclear war is also very considerable. As we all know, the consequences of an all-out exchange would be a nuclear winter in which those who started the interchange would be as badly affected in the long run as those who suffered the immediate attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the facilities that we are discussing this evening are targets, in the event of any threat. Precisely because Pine Gap is an early warning facility and because it is under the control of the Americans, in the event of the Russians getting itchy fingers it would be the first target. Of course, those rockets would not be sent from Russia with a long trajectory; they would be sent from submarines immediately offshore with a very short trajectory. So we can be absolutely assured that, in the event of any suggestion of nuclear exchange, Pine Gap will be a prime target. We can also be assured that contemplated nuclear war is no defence because of nuclear winter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that the Americans have substantially nuclearised their military forces. It follows from that that for Australia to depend on the US for defence is to depend on a defence which is no defence. In other words, we have a Clayton's defence system because we have come to rely so heavily on the Americans. It is for that reason that Australia would be in a much better position if it were to forgo the American military alliance. That is not to say that the Australian Democrats hate the Americans; that is not the situation at all. It is to say that we can enter into all sorts of relationships with the Americans, other than military ones. It is to say that this country would be better defended with a non-nuclear system which was developed totally within this country; a system of defence only-not a system of offence-a system which would be sufficiently strong to deter any aggressor and one which could not be used to attack any of our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> I pose for Government and Opposition members the scenario that Indonesia, for instance, might at some stage launch a non-nuclear attack against Australia. What would be the United States's response? I suggest that the US would not come to our aid for two reasons: firstly, because the US is also an ally of Indonesia and, secondly, because the US, if it got into any large scale conflagration eventually, would have to depend on the use of nuclear weapons, which it would not want to do. For that reason it is very unlikely that the presence of these bases poses any reasonable assurance to Australia that we would get any help with our defence in the only way that has any meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe that these bases should not persist on Australian soil as joint facilities. If they serve a useful function, by all means retain them. But they should be taken over by Australia and the information which they provide in terms of early warnings should be made available to all countries without fear or favour, and certainly not selectively to one side or the other. I would object as much to Russian bases on Australian soil as I do to American, English or any other bases. Contrary to what Senator Crichton-Browne said, if he looks at the record he will see that I have a long history of objecting to the United Kingdom presence in Australia exploding nuclear weapons at Maralinga, which has brought upon this country extremely long term and serious consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Australian Democrats are certainly not unilateral disarmament protagonists. We believe in a non-nuclear defence system which is based in Australia and on Australia, and which does not link Australia into military alliances with any other country, whether it be on the east or the west of the Iron Curtain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice the lateness of the hour and I do not wish to detain the Senate much longer, but I wish to say at least a few words on this important matter. I listened to the contributions of Senators Tambling, Crichton-Browne and Coulter. While I congratulate my colleagues Senator Tambling and Senator Crichton-Browne on their very good contributions to this debate and the mass of material that they have produced I must say that, listening to Senator Coulter, I was saddened by the fact that he clearly-although I believe him to be a man of goodwill-does not seem to understand the need for Australia to have friendships, alliances. He does not seem to understand that we do not achieve friendships simply by saying, `I am a friend'. There is a job involved in having friendships and friendships are a two-way street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that Senator Coulter would be perfectly happy to have the benefits of our allies' technology and their abilities to which we currently have access in these joint facilities. In the last moments of his speech he made it quite clear that he would be happy to have these abilities if they were nothing to do with any of our friends and that we had them entirely to ourselves. That is a very selfish way of looking at the protection of the world, I would have thought, and the ability of Western nations to preserve peace, which they have managed to do pretty successfully over the last 40 years without Senator Coulter's help or the help of the peace movement. It has not been by a repetition of the behaviour of the world's nations in the 1930s; it has been by learning from the lessons of those times and by making sure that democracies are well protected from aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to matters of some substance and record my pleasure at the statement put down in the other House yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. In response to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can say without any reservations that support for the joint facilities by the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, formerly in government, now in opposition and in future in government, remains completely undiminished. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The joint facilities have had our invariable and unwavering support because of the contribution they have made to the world wide Western strategic defence network. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sentiments of the Opposition, strongly stated and constant. They have not changed. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that although the Prime Minister of Australia has now seen the light in these matters, he once held very different views. We can all make mistakes and I am very glad to see that he has seen the light. The Opposition, formerly the government, has consistently held the view that we should strongly support and facilitate these joint facilities. I notice that some of our colleagues who represent the peace movement seem committed to calling them bases. It seems to give then some personal inner glow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that we cannot be entirely self-reliant. We believe that we need to make a contribution to our friends if we are to get the benefits of their technology. Although aiming for self-reliance, we cannot expect to produce all our own weapons and equipment; nor do we believe that we can rely solely on our own resources for intelligence information. We believe that we cannot command all the technology necessary for our defence. It certainly does not mean that we can abandon cooperation with our friends and allies. We believe that we will always see value for Australia in retaining a commitment to the United States and to allied ship and aircraft visits to Australia, even in circumstances where they may be nuclear powered and armed. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the Defence White Paper which the Government brought down last year. Clause 2.9, relating to the joint facilities, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar enhance stability by contributing to verification of arms limitation measures of the United States and the Soviet Union and to timely United States and Australian knowledge of developments that have military significance-including early warning of ballistic missile attack on the United States or its allies. New communications links are being established with the headquarters of the ADF in Canberra to give the Government and its advisers access to data from the facilities immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is clearly of immediate benefit to this country. The White Paper also said, in clause 2.11:</PARA>
<PARA> The benefits and costs for Australia in co-operating with the United States in the joint defence facilities have been carefully evaluated by the Government. The operations of the joint facilities do not involve derogation from our sovereignty. They serve Australian and US interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The White Paper also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Were Australia to cease our co-operation in the joint defence facilities there would only be adverse consequences for international security and higher risk of global war. This would neither serve Australia's interests nor those of the international community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are rather awesome words. I am sure that they were not inserted into that document lightly. It is a document which is supported both by the Government and by the Opposition. I think that those who ignore those solemn words do so not only at their own peril but also at the peril of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> In the statement put down by the Prime Minister there are a number of matters of some detail. Due to the lateness of the hour I do not intend to canvass them all. I simply draw attention to the increasing involvement of Australians in both the operation and the management of Pine Gap and Nurrungar and the increased opportunity for Australians to take more direct advantage of the capabilities of the facilities for our own purposes than we have been able to do in the past. The ability to have a highly reliable warning of attack in helping to prevent nuclear war by accident is a capability which is, of course, of great importance not just to us but to the world. The Prime Minister also pointed out that Pine Gap's function is to collect intelligence data which supports the national security of both Australia and the United States. The Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I think it is clear that nobody seriously committed to peace could argue for their closure. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the nub of it. We do have people who claim to be seriously committed to peace arguing not just strenuously but continuously and ad nauseam for their closure. Honourable senators will be aware, as I am, of the long nights we have spent in this place sitting out the adjournment debate while the independent senators who represent the peace movement have given us their views on the need to close these joint facilities. The problem with independent Senators Vallentine and Dunn is that they mouth peace while their policies, if adopted, would leave us vulnerable to aggression. They are false doctrines, in my opinion. They are seductive, they are dangerous and they are attractive, but they are very simplistic. As my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne said, these people have a fixation with things American but, as I mentioned earlier, they are clearly not students of history and they have not learned the lessons of unilateral disarmament. They have not learned that democracies get seduced by attractive doctrines such as theirs where totalitarian states do not. These people, I believe, well meaning though they may be-and I am not always sure of that-in my opinion are a danger to this nation. The monitoring of the arms control and the disarmament agreements is a major contribution to peace: trying to get rid of our friends and diminish Australia's own capabilities is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I close, I would like to draw attention to the final paragraph of the Prime Minister's statement. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These agreements confirm my Government's conviction that the joint defence facilities will continue to serve Australia's national interests; that they will continue to reflect the depth and substance of our bilateral strategic relationship with the United States under ANZUS; and that they will continue to play a vital role in preventing nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that they will play a vital role in preventing nuclear war, but I draw it to the Senate's attention that it is a great shame that the Government's fine statement relating to the depth and substance of our bilateral strategic relationship with the United States under ANZUS does not extend to other demonstrations of commitment to that relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the debate on 4 November on my urgency motion relating to the Bicentenary naval visits. Honourable senators will recall that the Government agreed to support my motion on that occasion and Senator Gareth Evans, speaking for the Government, said that the Government was prepared to take all the measures necessary and appropriate to solve future problems relating to such ship visits. I then asked of Senator Evans, `Well then, will you adopt my private member's Bill relating to the visit of nuclear-powered warships?'. Senator Evans said no, he would not do that. I asked him what legislative base he was prepared to have and he said that he believed that an approach based on necessary logistic support for such visits, rather than legislation, was the effective way of preventing a recurrence of the problem which we faced in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth with our visiting friends from the United States and the United Kingdom. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that that approach, rather than legislation, is the effective way of preventing a recurrence of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>When I asked him why, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The reason, as Senator Newman ought to appreciate, is that legislation designed to compel workers to berth ships would be a recipe for confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government of this country is not prepared to legislate to prevent unions from hijacking our defence and foreign affairs policy; it is not prepared to stop them hijacking the maintenance of our alliances. So while I welcome the statement by the Prime Minister in relation to the joint facilities, I draw the Senate's attention to the Government's inconsistency when it needs to keep our ports open to our allies and it fails to do so. In other words, our allies are welcome in our joint facilities but not in our ports if our left wing unions disapprove of the visits. I conclude by saying that the Opposition is pleased to support the statement put down by the Prime Minister relating to the extension of the agreement on the joint facilities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth currently collects the following data from higher education institutions in respect of students and staff via the higher education student data collection and the higher education staff statistics collection respectively:</PARA>
<PARA>Students</PARA>
<PARA> a unique student identifier code;</PARA>
<PARA> date of birth, sex, student's postcode both for the semester and the permanent home location;</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginality;</PARA>
<PARA> courses in which students are enrolled, basis for admission to such courses, and pattern of attendance (i.e. full-time/part-time and internal/external);</PARA>
<PARA> details about prior courses undertaken by students;</PARA>
<PARA> a measure of `student load';</PARA>
<PARA> information on overseas students and whether the student is a fee-paying student.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the educational profile process institutions have also provided aggregated data in respect of courses offered or to be offered at the institution, details on projected commencements and completions and estimates of student load.</PARA>
<PARA>Staff</PARA>
<PARA> The following information is obtained in respect of full-time and fractional full-time staff.</PARA>
<PARA> a unique staff identifier code;</PARA>
<PARA> profile data covering date of birth, sex, classification and term of appointment;</PARA>
<PARA> resources data covering details about their current duties, where they are working within the institution, what they are doing in terms of teaching or research or other, together with a measure of the proportion of time devoted to such functions; and</PARA>
<PARA> salary data for non-academic staff.</PARA>
<PARA> Some aggregated data in respect of groups of staff are also collected. The following types of aggregated data are collected:</PARA>
<PARA> resources data in respect of casual staff;</PARA>
<PARA> data relating to release for participation in a Professional Experience Program or Outside Studies Program;</PARA>
<PARA> commencement and separation data in relation to full-time tenured academic staff; and</PARA>
<PARA> data relating to the outside funding of staff resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As the collections are computer based, the exact questions relating to students and staff are in the form of data elements. Copies of the Data Element Dictionary for each of the collections referred to above have been provided to Senator Teague.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Students-Prior to 1987 the data for colleges was provided in aggregate on forms. To enable institutions to provide accurate aggregated data it was necessary for institutions to collect the majority of the data detailed in the Data Element Dictionary for 1987 and 1988. For universities, unit record data i.e. data in respect of individual students, has been collected since 1977. Again the majority of the data collected has remained the same over this period although it has been necessary to refine the data specifications to ensure comparable data was collected across the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Staff</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1988 staff data for both universities and colleges was also collected in aggregate on forms.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the forms collection only provided aggregated data the scope of the data collected was similar to that collected in the current higher education staff statistics collection. Copies of the documentation provided to institutions in respect of the years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 have been provided to Senator Teague.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Students-Following its introduction in 1987 a number of enhancements have been identified for the higher education student data collection. These enhancements have been identified by institutions and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. As a result of these identified enhancements and the introduction of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme changes are to be made to the collection in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> For 1989 institutions will be required to provide additional information as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> more detailed data on citizenship/residential status;</PARA>
<PARA> additional data on extent and year of prior participation in various types of education;</PARA>
<PARA> details of exemption granted for prior studies at the first time of enrolment in the current course;</PARA>
<PARA> tertiary entrance score for students commencing undergraduate courses direct from secondary education;</PARA>
<PARA> student load by unit of study;</PARA>
<PARA> completion status for individual units of study; and</PARA>
<PARA> information on the liability of students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme which is to be introduced from 1 January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Staff</PARA>
<PARA> Institutions will not be required to provide any additional data relating to staff in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The information is stored in aggregated and unit record datasets on a stand alone computer.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A unique identifier code is included on data records relating to individual students and staff when the data is provided to the Commonwealth. This code provides a means for the Commonwealth of validating the data according to previously determined specifications. This code also enables the Commonwealth to undertake longitudinal studies. The identifier and how it is allocated is strictly confidential to each institution.</PARA>
<PARA> While the code is provided to the Commonwealth with the data records it is not maintained on either the unit record or aggregated datasets.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The date collected by the Commonwealth is used as a basis for funding decisions for higher education institutions and in undertaking policy analysis associated with the Government's role in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) A unique identifier code is used to identify students rather than personal information such as name and address. This protects the confidentiality of students and staff. When data is received in the Department it is loaded into datasets in an aggregated form i.e. individual students or staff members are not able to be identified. While a unit record data set is maintained for students and staff the code is removed after data has been validated. Access to the unit record data sets is limited to a small number of staff within the Tertiary Statistics and Operations Branch on a need to know basis. General access, on a need to know basis within the Department, is provided to the aggregated datasets only.</PARA>
<PARA> Institutions are advised to use commercial couriers when sending magnetic data to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Government's Policy discussion paper on higher education highlighted a number of significant deficiencies in the existing higher education database. The additional information being collected will be used by the Government in its monitoring and funding roles in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) As indicated in the Green Paper there are significant deficiencies in the higher education database which necessitate an urgent upgrading of the data provided by institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) It is not possible for officers in the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Finance to have access to other than published aggregated data.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) Certain departmental staff, on a need to know basis only, have access to datasets of aggregated data. The designated processing staff in the Tertiary Statistics and Operations Branch are the only officers of the Department who have access to the unit record data supplied by institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) Including ADP and statistical processing staff (Tertiary Statistics Section) a total of 13 officers currently have access to the unit record data collection.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) The data is provided to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training as a condition of Commonwealth funding. As such the information is not available except in aggregated form to other Commonwealth department or bodies except the Affirmative Action Agency. It has been agreed with institutions that the Department will provide the Agency with the unit record data on staff as a means of reducing demands on institutions for the same or similar data.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Not by the Commonwealth. This facility is only available to the institution which supplied the data.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) No. The data collected by the Department does not contain the name and address of the student to which the identifier could be attached to identify students.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Telecom advises that ISDN requires a network with a capability for 64K bit/s digital connectivity end-to-end, with new telephone exchanges capable of handling the powerful new signalling protocol.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Telecom estimates that by June 1990 it will have spent between $30 and $40 million on new capital and labour in addition to normal plant expansion in order to provide this service. This estimated figure is broadly based with no expenditure break-downs for capital cities, provincial cities or rural and remote areas being currently available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) ISDN is not currently in service. Telecom plans to launch the service commercially in 1989. An ISDN exchange has been installed in both Sydney and Melbourne, and these are currently in the test phase.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) $19 million (estimated).</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Telecom advises ISDN installation costs are calculated, by taking into account capital, labour, research, testing and provision of other interface equipment together with other normal overheads.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Telecom advises the likely demand for ISDN services is estimated at 10% of business lines by 1995. Estimates are based on Telecom's expectations of needs of the corporate sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Telecom expects to announce access and usage tariffs for ISDN by mid October 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Telecom has advised me that the extent to which ISDN is in place in the UK, Japan, Canada and USA is:</PARA>
<PARA> UK-No announcement reported on ISDN so far. British Telecom has a pre-ISDN service called (Integrated Digital Access).</PARA>
<PARA> Japan-NTT introduced an ISDN service in April 1988. The service consists of two 64K/s information channels and one 16K bit/s signalling channel.</PARA>
<PARA> Canada-It is reported that Bell Canada will commence ISDN customer trials in November 1988 with a commercial service expected late 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> USA-Earlier this year, Southern Bell introduced the first commercially available ISDN service in the world. It is reported that AT&amp;T plans to introduce ISDN in 1988 in 18 cities across the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) ISDN is an evolutionary development which has been under consideration by Telecom for a number of years. Telecom announced its ISDN plans in a press release dated 11 October 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) ISDN is directed at large corporate business users and is not aimed at residential users at this stage. It is anticipated that the business user will use ISDN for both data and voice telecommunications in the switched and dedicated mode at transmission speeds of 64K bit/s for fast facsimile transmissions, enhanced videotex applications, computer based business transactions, corporate data and voice communication, and development and use of new value-added network applications.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Telecom has conducted a number of internal and external studies. Organisations external to Telecom involved in various aspects of ISDN considerations were:</PARA>
<PARA> P A Management</PARA>
<PARA> Coopers and Lybrand-W D Scott</PARA>
<PARA> Logica</PARA>
<PARA> Ovum</PARA>
<PARA> Yankee Group.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 24 August 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the recent Annual Conference of Australian Ministers for Mining and Energy, did the Northern Territory Department of Minerals and Energy submit a document in which it suggested that Australia could sell as much as 15,000 tonnes per year of uranium from which it claimed Australia would earn $1000 million in export revenues.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Was the current spot-price for uranium posted at $15.10 for the Nuexco Exchange Value and $15.00-$15.50 for the Nukem spot range, and going down, with substantial transactions now taking place at less than $15 per lb ($30 per kg).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Have contract prices tended to move towards spot-prices over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is it correct that, at prices of $30 per kg, 15,000 tonnes per year exports would gain Australia not $1 billion per year as Mr Barry Coulter claims, but no more than $450 million per year, without including the capital and operating costs, and perhaps half that when those costs are included.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The August Nukem spot price was in the range $US13.90-15.00/lb U308. The August Nuexco spot price was $US14.15-15.00/lb U308. The spot price has remained below $US20.00/lb since early 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Whilst the depressed spot market has had a donwnward influence on the long-term contract price there is still a significant premium between the two. According to Nukem the long-term delivery prices into Europe and the United States in 1986 were $US31.00 and $US25.86/lb U308 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At $US30/kg (spot price) 15 000 tonnes U308 would earn $US450 million, or about $A560 million at current exchange rates. However, exports are not permitted unless in accordance with the Government's floor price, which is based on long-term price levels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend proposing the re-establishment of the Advisory Council of Inter-Government Relations. A review of that organisation in 1986 found that it had had limited success in improving inter-governmental relations and recommended its abolition. There was little support for its continuation amongst State Governments and the recommendation of the review was accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> I will continue the very successful policy of using the Local Government Ministers' Conference as the major forum for discussion between the three spheres of government. Since the creation of the first federal Ministry for Local Government in 1983, leading to a more active Commonwealth involvement in the Conference, it has become a much more effective instrument for building constructive inter-government relations.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition I am proposing to hold special discussions between representatives of national local government organisations and senior Commonwealth Ministers within the next few months. These discussions will cover major matters of mutual concern and will be designed to strengthen relations between local government and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> I will also continue the Government's policy of using the Local Government Development Program to facilitate improved dialogue between the three spheres of government by providing grants to finance ways of working together on particular issues of concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 May 1988 (Hansard page 3076), Senator Puplick asked me as the Minister representing the Attorney-General the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Was advice sought by the Minister responsible for the Constitution Alteration (Fair Elections) Bill from the Australian Electoral Commission in relation to the compatibility of the Government's proposed electoral system for the Australian Capital Territory with its proposed referendum requirements and the impact which those constitutional changes might have on State voting systems? If no advice was sought from the Australian Electoral Commission why was the Government's alleged electoral expertise in that Commission ignored? If the Electoral Commission was consulted what advice did it give the Government?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Can he say whether any advice has been sought from the Australian Electoral Commission now that it has been revealed that the legislation before the Parliament is defective and the Government has taken a decision to proceed with amendment, or has the expertise of the Australian Electoral Commission been ignored again?</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There was no direct consultation with the Australian Electoral Commission on the Constitution Alteration (Fair Elections) Bill 1988 before the Bill was introduced into the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill retained the basic principles of the draft Bill prepared by the Constitutional Commission that the number of electors in electoral divisions should not be more than 10% above or below the average and that the right to vote should be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government Bill differed from the Constitutional Commission Bill because of a number of problems in the Commission Bill. In particular, in providing an assurance that all elections conducted in an electorate at large would be fair elections, the Bill broke new ground in order to solve a problem not resolved by the Constitutional Commission (or in the 1987 Macklin Bill). It provided a workable scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission Bill included separate provisions dealing with one vote/one value and the right to vote for each of the House of Representatives, State Parliaments and Territory legislatures. Chapter VIA of the Government Bill consisted of general provisions applicable in respect of all elections. The simpler format of the Bill avoided the repetitions in the Commission Bill by locating the `fair election' provisions in one place, instead of having them scattered through the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission Bill could have been interpreted as imposing a requirement that electoral divisions continuously comply with the one vote/one value principle. Such a requirement would have been unduly burdensome and probably impractical. The Government Bill required that there be a redistribution at least every 7 years. There was also to be a redistribution if, on the last day of any 2 successive months since the last redistribution, more than 1/3 of the electorates exceeded the +- 10% tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government Bill also dealt with the failure of the Commission Bill to provide a one vote/one value formula covering multi-member divisions in federal and territorial elections.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government Bill applied to voting after 1 year whereas the Commission Bill proposed a 2 year period. The 1 year period of grace in the Bill provided a reasonable opportunity for the Commonwealth, States and mainland Territories to make any necessary amendments to their electoral laws. The Government Bill extended only to mainland Territories, whereas the Commission Bill applied to all Territories, it included a strengthened provision dealing with standing and made explicit the power of the courts to enforce its provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the concern expressed over the effect the Government Bill might have on the electoral systems for the New South Wales and South Australia Upper Houses and the proposed d'Hondt system for the Australian Capital Territory, my Department consulted extensively with the Australian Electoral Commission on the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats to the Bill in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 June 1988 (Hansard page 3343), Senator Peter Baume asked me a question without notice concerning the distribution to students of material relating to the report of the Committee on Higher Education Funding (the Wran Report). The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following release of the Wran Report on 5 May 1988, the Government provided copies of the report's Overview and Recommendations to all higher education students. In order to protect the confidentiality of student records, bulk supplies of this material were forwarded to all higher education institutions. Arrangements were made for the institutions to forward the material direct to students, on the understanding that distribution costs would be reimbursed by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Five hundred thousand copies of the Overview and Recommendations were printed at a cost of $67,723. The cost of bulk distribution to the institutions from Canberra was $42,046. The full cost of postage paid by institutions in the course of distributing the material cannot be determined until all claims for reimbursement are received. As at 19 September 1988, 44 institutions had been reimbursed for the cost of the distribution, to the amount of $187,043.01.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to give wide publicity to the Wran Committee's report enabled an informed discussion of its proposals. The Government was particularly concerned to ensure that those most affected by the proposed reforms-higher education students-were accurately informed and given the opportunity to comment on the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> I have forwarded to Senator Baume under separate cover, a copy of the material provided to students.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to the specific functions of the Business Regulation Review Unit (BRRU), the Unit does not keep information in a form which enables me to answer the question as posed. The BRRU does not normally comment on specific provisions of bills, subordinate legislation and executive orders.</PARA>
<PARA> The BRRU's advice on regulatory issues which affect business is normally provided at an early stage in the policy development process, including providing advice on Regulatory Impact Statements. This is most commonly at the Cabinet Submission stage and like any other agency of Government, the BRRU's input into cabinet submissions is subject to the ordinary rules of Government confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA> However in terms of numbers the BRRU has commented on:</PARA>
<PARA> 248 Cabinet submissions, and</PARA>

<PARA> A significant number of proposals have been amended as a result of input into the policy development process by the BRRU.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally there are many regulatory proposals falling outside the Cabinet Process on which the BRRU is consulted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The factors which led to the construction site tragedy in Queen Street Brisbane will be considered at a coronial inquiry. The Queensland Government has already taken action to ensure that chains as well as slings are used to secure loads. With regard to a standard or safety code to cover such events, it is the responsibility of respective States/Territories to introduce construction safety regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> The role of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Worksafe Australia) with regard to occupational health and safety standards is to encourage a national approach through the issue of specific standards and codes of practices which the States and Territories can adopt in legislation and regulations. The National Commission through representation of the States/Territories, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Australian Industry aims to achieve national agreement on standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Norfolk Island:</PARA>
<PARA>The Employment Bill 1988 provides for Codes of Practice to ensure safe working environments. The Norfolk Island Government also has a policy of not allowing building structures greater than two storeys.</PARA>
<PARA>Ashmore and Cartier Islands:</PARA>
<PARA>Ashmore and Cartier Islands are uninhabited. The Ashmore Reef is a declared National Nature Reserve and Cartier Island is a gazetted bombing range.</PARA>
<PARA>Christmas Island:</PARA>
<PARA>The laws of Christmas Island are basically those of the Colony of Singapore at the time the Island was transferred to Australia in 1958, as amended from time to time by Commonwealth ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA> Some industrial safety legislation is in place, such as the Machinery Ordinance (an ordinance of the Colony of Singapore which remains in force in the Territory of Christmas Island), and the Explosives (Storage and Use) Ordinance 1979. The former regulates the use of machinery in building work, the latter the use of explosives. The legal regime of the Island, however, is deficient in some respects and steps are being taken to update legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Very little building work has been undertaken in recent years on the Island and few buildings are of greater than two storeys. There are currently proposals for private redevelopment of some accommodation blocks, mostly of one or two storeys. Leases for such developments under the Christmas Island Lands Ordinance 1987 will provide that plans and specifications must be approved by the Commonwealth in accordance with Australian Capital Territory (ACT) standards as if the building was situated in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between the Commonwealth and the proposed resort/casino developer also requires that specifications be in accordance with the ACT standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Private phosphate mining is likely to commence on the Island in 1989 making use of existing machinery, plant and infrastructure. A Mining Ordinance is currently in preparation and will be based on relevant Western Australian legislation including the Machinery Safety Act 1978.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) When it was introduced on 15 May 1985 the EEP had a funding of US$2b in the form of Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) owned commodities and was to apply until 30 September 1988. Expenditure under the program was at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> The Food Security Act, 1985, which was signed into law on 23 December 1985, mandated expenditure under the EEP of not less than US$2b in the form of CCC owned commodities over the period October 1985-September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> On 20 March 1986 President Reagan signed the Food Security Improvements Act 1986 which provided for, inter alia, a reduction in mandatory expenditure under the EEP from US$2b to US$1b and provided for discretionary funding of up to US$500m, giving a total funding of up to US$1.5b in CCC owned commodities.</PARA>
<PARA> The US Department of Agriculture announced on 30 July 1987 that it would continue to fund the EEP beyond the US$1.5b specified in the Food Security Improvements Act, under the CCC Charter Act 1948. Additional funds of some US$700m were provided under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Agricultural Competitiveness and Trade Act of 1988 (part of the Trade legislation which was signed by President Reagan on 23 August 1988) increased funding for the EEP to US$2.5b and extends the program to September 1990. This Act also provides that in January-February 1990 the President must report to Congress on progress in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. If the President certified that there has been no significant progress he must instruct the Secretary of Agriculture to implement a marketing loan for the 1990 wheat crop or extend the EEP. Under this provision the EEP funding would be increased by US$2b during US fiscal years 1990 to 1992.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has not quantified the cost of the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). It is difficult to accurately quantify the costs of a specific subsidy program, such as the EEP, in isolation from other factors operating in world grains markets.</PARA>
<PARA> Export subsidy programs are, in fact, only one example of a number of subsidy programs which impact negatively on world grains prices. US and EC farm support programs, which encourage production in excess of reasonable market demand, are major factors contributing to the disruption of world grains markets. Excess production is either disposed of on world markets with the assistance of export subsidies or put into stocks which overhang the market-both of which act to depress world prices.</PARA>
<PARA> It is competition between the subsidies of the US and the EC which determine sales prices and this is another reason why it is difficult to isolate the effects of the EEP. There is little doubt, however, that the effect of export subsidies, for grains, on the Australian agricultural sector is substantial.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's approach to trade reform is to seek the elimination of all trade distorting measures encompassing both domestic support and export subsidy programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Education Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Volunteering is usually defined as a situation where an individual, under no duress whatsoever, provides his or her labour to an organisation without promise or expectation of remuneration. For this reason volunteering is not considered part of the labour market or labour force, a term which normally relates to persons in employment or persons available for and actively seeking paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Government announced in the context of the 1987-88 Budget its decision to form SkillShare by integrating the CVP and the Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) and the Community Training Program (CTP) to achieve a more effective use of available funds and to ensure that community-based assistance is provided for structured training and employment related support for the most disadvantaged job-seekers. SkillShare will commence on 1 January 1989 with existing projects being funded under current arrangements until the end of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is a focus on structured skills training in the new program, the SkillShare guidelines make specific provision for projects to offer a broad range of open access activities including volunteering, employment-related personal support services and personal effectiveness training to complement structured skills training.</PARA>
