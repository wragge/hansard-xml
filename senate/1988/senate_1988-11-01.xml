<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the deaths on 27 October 1988 of John Thomas Kane, a Senator for the State of New South Wales from 1970 to 1974, and the Hon. Mervyn George Everett, QC, a Senator for the State of Tasmania from 1974 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of their meritorious public service and tenders its sympathy to their families in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>I intend to be quite brief in my remarks about this matter. Senator Kane was not known to me personally. He was a senator from the State of New South Wales for four years as a member of the Democratic Labor Party and he had had a long and prominent career, in the earlier part of his life, in the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in New South Wales. On behalf of the Labor Party, I extend to his family our regrets at his passing. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Senator Everett was known to me personally and I want to say one or two things. Mervyn Everett was born on 7 October 1917 at Hobart, Tasmania. Prior to entering Federal Parliament, he was elected in 1964 to the seat of Denison in the Tasmanian House of Assembly and he held that seat until his resignation in April 1974. Mr Everett served Tasmania as Minister for Health from 1964 to 1969, and as Deputy Premier, Attorney-General, Minister for the Environment, and Minister Administering the Racing and Gaming Act from 1972 to 1974. He was elected to the Senate in 1974. He served on various parliamentary committees, including the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which he was Chairman, and the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the privilege, indeed the pleasure, of serving on some of those committees with Senator Everett, particularly the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. As I recall it, Senator Chaney was a member of the Committee for some of that time and Senator Peter Baume was also a member of the Committee. I think at various times Senator Chaney and I were both on the Privileges and Regulations and Ordinances committees with the then Senator Everett. In his chairmanship of those committees he displayed not only a profound legal knowledge-Mervyn Everett was a very fine lawyer-but also an incredible degree of fairness. He was a very fair and sensible chairman and he guided the committees in a way of which any Senate could be proud in terms of the work they had to do at that time. He was also a very regular contributor to debate in this chamber; he always made good contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of those little things of history one recalls: On 11 November 1975 Senator Everett was in this chamber at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I had just been told that the Government had been dismissed and I came in and told him. I think that he was on his own in the chamber. He made some remark like, `Anything's possible'. I do not recall exactly what it was, but I remember that incident very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Mervyn Everett was an eminent jurist. He was a law lecturer. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1965 and served both as a Supreme Court judge and a justice of the Federal Court. While attending a legal conference in Singapore on the implications of the Nuremberg trials, he was taken ill and died suddenly. I think that at that time he was preparing a PhD thesis on that topic. As I have suggested earlier, he was a loyal and tireless worker for his Party-the Labor Party-and a respected member of the Senate. He was President of the Tasmanian branch of the ALP from 1973 to 1974, something which is always an onerous task. I have no doubt that he discharged it with great skill. He also served his country as a member of the Australian Imperial Force for four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I was privileged enough to be able to number Merv Everett amongst my closer friends in this place. I regard him as having led a very dedicated and fine life in law and politics. I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in its bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion of condolence which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Both Mr Kane and Mr Everett were in the Senate for relatively short periods-Mr Kane from 1970 to 1974 and Mr Everett from 1974 to 1975. Each, in a very different way, made a very significant contribution both to the Senate and to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not know former Senator Kane. He left the Senate in the election in which both Senator Button and I were elected to this place. He, along with the other Democratic Labor Party (DLP) senators, lost his seat. I think that that was the last representation that they had in this Parliament. Therefore, I am unable to speak of him personally, but I was struck by the description of him that was given by Mr B. A. Santamaria in the Australian newspaper today. I think that it would be a fairer representation of him to use Mr Santamaria's words than to use my own. Mr Santamaria made the point in this morning's Australian that there were a number of qualities of Mr Kane which were of note. Referring to both Mr Kane and the late Harry Hurrell, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> No two people more clearly manifested the fundamental philosophical values of the industrial movement which, during the 1940s and '50s, defeated the communist drive to take over the Australian trade unions and the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Kane and Hurrell were Labor men, born and bred. Both the circumstances of their origins and the hardships of their earliest years had implanted in them a strong instinct for social justice in its original connotation. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Kane was a manual worker and the offspring of generations of manual workers who had never had the advantage of a secondary, let alone tertiary, education. As Mr Santamaria pointed out, Mr Kane and men like him were to prove that dedication to a cause, accompanied by unremitting work, based on a set of firmly held moral principles, could accomplish much more than mere education endowment when it rests on nothing more solid than today's shifting sands of moral relativism. Mr Santamaria continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Jack Kane began his working life as a miner in Lithgow, the early death of his father forcing him to become the family's breadwinner-at 12 shillings and sixpence a week. Thrown out of work in the Depression, he kept his family together by selling fruit and vegetables door to door. </PARA>
<PARA> Kane's industrial abilities had been noted by the Communist Party leadership during his mining days in Lithgow, and he was invited to join its Militant Minority Movement. But despite the economic devastation of the Depression providing plenty of justification, his religious faith and democratic instincts made him refuse the tempting offer of guaranteed future union leadership in the communist interest. </PARA>
<PARA> He became a member of the NSW Transport Workers Union, opposing the existing union leadership after viewing the corruption which flourished at that time, and paid the penalty with threats being made against him and his family. </PARA>
<PARA> When the ``Movement'' was formed to fight communism in the mid-'40s, Jack Kane joined. He went on to join the ALP Industrial Group Movement, becoming its NSW secretary and, later, organising secretary and acting State secretary of the ALP. He was sacked when gross betrayal led to the victory of the Evattite forces over the NSW State executive in 1955-56. The NSW Democratic Labor Party, which he founded, joined with the Victorian ALP to establish a nationwide DLP, of which he became federal secretary. Later, as a senator for NSW, Kane was to distinguish himself among the impressive company of the five DLP senators. </PARA>
<PARA> When, after the tragic ``Gair Affair'', the DLP was eliminated as a parliamentary force, Kane continued to work for the same ideals as had animated the previous 30 years of his life as federal vice-president of the National Civic Council (NCC). </PARA>
<PARA> Although terminally ill, Kane attended a meeting of the NSW State executive of the NCC on the Saturday before his death. It can be truthfully said that he never gave up. </PARA>
<PARA>I have used the words of Mr Santamaria not because they would be universally agreed with in this chamber, but because I think they reflect one of his distinguished contemporary's views of his life, views which I substantially share. Mr Kane was part of one of the great dramas of Australian politics in the mid-1950s. I think that all honourable senators would agree that the breaches within the Australian Labour Party (ALP) at that time were based on very strongly differing principles and views about principles. Senator Kane and the other DLP Senators were outraged by the Gair appointment to an ambassadorship by the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and ultimately they all lost their seats in the Parliament, having threatened Supply in 1974. Mr Kane, obviously, made a very distinguished, vigorous and important contribution during those years. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend our sympathy to his family. </PARA>
<PARA> The late Mervyn George Everett was elected to Parliament at the same election as Senator Button and I were. He chose to leave, as I recall, at the following election. I think he found that there were other areas in which his very considerable talents could be put to better use. I echo many of the things which were said by Senator Button. I had the great pleasure of serving with him on a number of committees such as the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control and, more importantly, on the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of which he was chairman from February 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> For those people who believe that Parliament has a greater role, Senator Everett's role during the last year of the Whitlam Government was a very distinguished one indeed. Those honourable senators who were here at the time will remember the commitment of the Whitlam Government to the national compensation scheme and the examination of that proposal by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of Mervyn Everett. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that as a very new senator I was extremely concerned at the outcome of that inquiry because it seemed to me that the evidence pointed to the need for very considerable change to that proposal. As the inquiry continued under the chairmanship of Senator Everett, I was extremely impressed by his objectivity and fairness-I think `fairness' was the expression used by Senator Button-and I do not think anybody could say that the evidence which was put before that Committee was not very carefully presented in the Committee's report. Of course, the Committee reported in terms that the legislation should be withdrawn and redrafted. That took a fair amount of political courage, as Senator Button will remember, from the upbraiding that I recall his receiving in a very public way from the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. During that inquiry I was deeply impressed by the legal skills of Senator Everett. They were of the highest order. He had, in addition to the qualities which have been mentioned by Senator Button, very great qualities as a draftsman. He wrote beautifully, and that is unusual. That is the only point which I would make in addition to those very complimentary remarks which have been made by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a bit to do with the Everett family. As one saw from time to time both in his political role and later in his Inter-State Commission role, like many people in this place he had a family with split political affiliations. His daughter was a very active member of the Tasmanian Young Liberals. During that period I saw her, and I remember thinking that they had a great deal in common but that there were many things which they did not share. On behalf of the Opposition I extend our sympathy to the late Mr Everett's family in the loss of a very distinguished and fine Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Neither I nor any of my colleagues knew Senators Kane and Everett, since they served in the Senate before any of us came to this chamber. I did, however, know Senator Kane by reputation. I think probably most people who followed the events of the split in the Australian Labor Party knew his name well. Senator Everett's name as a distinguished parliamentarian in Tasmania was well known even though, unfortunately, it is sometimes more difficult to get news between the Australian States than between our country and overseas countries. The political career of Mr Everett used to turn up in the Queensland newspapers from time to time. He was certainly a figure, even when in the State Parliament, who had a national standing. It is not possible to make any comments with regard to any knowledge that we had of them personally. I would therefore just like to associate my colleagues with the motion moved by Senator Button and extend our condolences to the families of Senator Kane and Senator Everett.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a Tasmanian Labor senator, I thought it appropriate to participate in support of this motion of condolence for Mervyn Everett, whose sudden death came as a shock to me a few days ago. I had known Merv Everett since I first became involved in the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania in the late 1960s. He was one of the Labor members of the House of Assembly for Denison. He had been Minister for Health in previous Labor governments and was Attorney-General in the State Labor Government which returned to office in Tasmania early in 1972. One of the things from that period for which I remember him was his courageous decision to give his Attorney-General's fiat which allowed a conservation movement court case to go ahead in connection with the flooding of Lake Pedder, his action being contrary to the obvious preference of the Cabinet of which he was a member at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was particularly helpful and supportive of me during my term as the member for Denison in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1975 and I was greatly appreciative of that. When the 1974 Federal double dissolution election arose suddenly, Merv Everett made a sudden decision to resign from the State Parliament and seek endorsement on the Party's ticket for the Senate. He thereby became a member of the Senate for the following 18 months, coming in with Don Grimes, who had already been endorsed as a candidate for the half-Senate election which had been expected. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney referred to this matter. Merv and Don, plus John Button, were amongst those who earned the ire of Gough Whitlam late in 1975 because of the Senate committee report they presented which did not wholeheartedly endorse the then proposed national compensation scheme. The phase `bloody doctors and lawyers' is one I well remember coming from the then Prime Minister. While it was a bit of a come-down for a senior State Minister to find himself as a backbencher here, I think Merv Everett quite enjoyed his period in the Senate although, of course, he experienced the frustration of being a member of the Caucus at that time which we all shared. </PARA>
<PARA> His Senate career was cut short, as was my House of Representatives career, by the 1975 double dissolution. While we had won five Senate seats in 1974, we could manage only four in 1975. Merv Everett had volunteered to run at No. 5 after Don Grimes, who was placed at No. 4, in the hope of that being of assistance to the Party. Although he missed out on keeping his seat, at one stage of the count it looked as though he would be elected from the No. 5 position at the expense of Don Grimes. I think Don Grimes had virtually conceded that he had lost his seat. However, that did not happen and he, of course, went on to become a respected Minister in this Government. I think I can speak for Don Grimes, who is now our Ambassador to the Netherlands, in saying that he would be more upset than most to hear of the loss of Merv Everett. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Everett then returned to the bar, to the State Supreme Court, then to the Federal Court of Australia and the Presidency of the Inter-State Commission where he did some very valuable and solid work. It was from this position that he retired not so long ago. In recent years I saw him mainly on aeroplanes and in airport lounges. He was always keen to have interesting and informative conversations about current events and the state of the world. I will always value those chats and the wisdom he imparted. As is clear to everyone, Merv Everett had a varied career of real public service for which Tasmania and the nation are grateful. He maintained his loyalty to and interest in the Australian Labor Party. I pass on my condolences to his widow, Daphne. I again express my thanks and those of the Tasmanian Branch of the ALP for Mervyn George Everett's distinguished life and friendship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly as a Liberal senator for Tasmania to pay tribute to the contribution of an Australian Labor Party senator from my State. He was one of those rare individuals who, no matter what he did in his public life, made a contribution to his State in such a varied field, as so many before me have said. I found him a man with an intriguing mind, with great capacity for intellectual thought. He was recognised as a fine lawyer. In fact, it was as Attorney-General that I knew him. He had the perspicacity to offer me a job. However, within a week or so he changed his mind and came to Canberra instead-so the job was not there either. I would also like to remember him for the final job he did for my State and that was as Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, where he reviewed in detail the worth of the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. All Tasmanians owe him a debt for having put that firmly on the record as being of great and lasting importance to Tasmania. This Government has now accepted that the scheme must be continued as those on this side of the chamber have always believed. I mourn his passing and I also add my condolences to those expressed to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate myself with the condolence motion for Merv Everett and Jack Kane; I knew them both. Merv Everett served in the State Parliament for 10 years prior to coming to the Federal Parliament. He was Minister for Health for about five or six of those years. The portfolio was not without controversy, amongst which was the issue of fluoride.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I knew Merv in the Australian Labor Party when consideration was being given in 1975 to the possibility of a double dissolution. I was on the State Executive of the Labor Party. Merv Everett volunteered to drop down to the No. 5 position when he could have received the second or third position. It was rather ironical that subsequently I was expelled from the Labor Party and I then stood for the Senate. I suppose it could have been said that I could have taken Merv Everett's position although it could equally have been said that I could have taken a position from the other side. Nevertheless, I do not know whether Merv, having been in State Cabinet for almost 10 years and having served as a chairman of a committee of a government of which he was a member, would have taken it easily sitting on the back bench under a new administration. I recall that another senator, Jim McClelland, did not find that experience very easy or very enlightening. He continued to say so then, and probably continues to say so now. </PARA>
<PARA> Merv Everett was a Queen's Counsel. He went on to become a judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. As has been said, he served as President of the Inter State Commission. He did some very interesting work on the implications of the Nuremberg trials. There are many of us who are interested in the implications of the Nuremberg trials, particularly as they relate to the issue of experiments on humans. I will be one who will be very interested to read of Merv Everett's studies in that sphere. </PARA>
<PARA> On Thursday I heard of Merv's death from a member of the police force who was visibly upset at his death. That person had had his battles and, I am sure, Merv Everett was one who understood those and acted so that justice was eventually achieved. My sympathy is extended to his family. </PARA>
<PARA> I also knew Jack Kane. The history of his contribution in the political sphere has been detailed by Senator Chaney and by Senator Button. I do not want to go over those details. Jack Kane was well known by the press gallery both before and after he became a senator. Members of the press gallery invariably described him in a respectful way as being politically seasoned and shrewd. For example, Max Walsh commented in one article in 1972:</PARA>
<PARA>Even Senator Jack Kane's political opponents, of which he has host, concede that the DLP Senator is one of the country's craftiest politicians . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That might have been so. He was in fact regarded as a very good political organiser. He had the ability to organise and marshal the talents of other people. For example, in the 1950s he succeeded in getting the late Professor James McAuley to prepare drafts, statements and manifestos. His election to the Senate was regarded as a bit of a fluke because he benefited unexpectedly from the flow of Australian Labor Party preferences. However, had there been a succession of double dissolutions, as we have experienced since that time, he would have been in the Senate much earlier than 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a battler. His maiden speech was largely devoted to the inadequacy of the income on which retirees and pensioners had to struggle. I do not think this occurs nowadays but his maiden speech was delivered in support of an urgency motion which he had moved. </PARA>
<PARA> Jack Kane did in fact devote his life to uplifting the downtrodden and to cham- pioning the causes of the underprivileged. He was part of the movement to bring about a greater measure of social justice within the overall framework of Christian social principles. Of course, he was opposed very strongly to the communist and left wing influence in Australia, particularly in the trade union movement. Over the decades many aspiring trade union candidates benefited from his advice and knowledge. Some of them went on to win positions of influence in important trade unions and brought them within the fold of the Labor Party. Jack Kane, however, was essentially a humble person who never sought any personal limelight unless it was useful to the cause in which he was involved. He made no claim to being highly educated, but was a good platform orator in the Labor style of the 1940s and 1950s. He would deliver a sharp attack, but not a malicious attack. </PARA>
<PARA> I am inclined to think that one of the significant events for which Jack Kane will be remembered is the Burchett case, when Wilfred Burchett sued him over an article in November 1971 which alleged that Wilfred Burchett had been associated with the KGB and had taken statements from Australian prisoners of war during the Korean conflict. Wilfred Burchett finally lost the case in 1974 when a 12-man jury found that while the article might have been defamatory of Burchett, it was a fair report of Senate proceedings. The jury was not required to make any finding about the truth of the material. Jack Kane and Wilfred Burchett were not really two individuals ranged against each other in court: it was a conflict between two dia- metrically opposed causes. </PARA>
<PARA> Jack Kane was buried in Botany cemetery yesterday, after a concelebrated requiem mass in St Thomas More's Catholic Church. I cannot think of any more aptly named church in which a requiem mass should be held for a person such as the late Jack Kane. Sir Thomas More stood for principles in public life, and so did Jack Kane. To his wife, Rose, their children, John and Pat, and their families, their late son Bob's family, to Jack's brother Charlie and to all his relatives and friends, I offer my sincere condolence at his parting. </PARA>

Pursuant to the undertaking which I gave to the Senate on 20 October 1988, I have further considered the matter of privilege raised by Senator Chaney, which I reported to the Senate on that day, in the light of the further communication from the Aboriginal Development Commission, which I also laid before the Senate on that day. In relation to the resolution of the Commission which was provided to me and which I presented to the Senate on 19 October, and the further resolution contained in the communication of the Commission of 20 October, I consider that it is for the Senate to determine whether the Commission's explanation of the first resolution is acceptable, or whether some further action should be taken on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the other matter referred to by Senator Chaney, namely, the action taken by the Commission against its Chairman, that is the same matter which was the subject of my statement of 12 October 1988 in response to a question asked by Senator Peter Baume, and which is under investigation by the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I think the proper thing for me to do is to await the report of that Committee on that matter before I make a final determination in respect of Senator Chaney's letter. The resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 requires me to make a determination on a matter of privilege `as soon as practicable', and I think it would be in accordance with that resolution for me to await the report of the Select Committee. As soon as possible after the Select Committee reports, I will report to the Senate my determination in respect of Senator Chaney's letter. The Senate will then be able to take whatever action it considers appropriate in relation to both matters, the resolution of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the matter examined by the Select Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. One in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned stresses the urgency of the need for the proposed development at Section 19 City to proceed, with a casino included. The casino is critical to the viability of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> The private sector in the ACT has consistently supported efforts to diversify the economic and employment bases in the Territory, aiming to increase private sector employment and reduce reliance on Government employment. All Governments have supported the need for this action.</PARA>
<PARA> The Civic Square Entertainment Centre is a vital step in the process. It will not only cushion the effect of the current, and sharp, downturn in the construction industry, but will provide an additional 1,400 permanent jobs when it begins operation. It will provide over 500 jobs during the construction period.</PARA>
<PARA> A McNair Anderson survey commissioned by the private sector found the Canberra Community to be 2:1 in favour of a casino. A Social Impact Study for the Government could not see why the development, with a properly controlled casino, should not proceed. We believe it was a properly based enquiry with well-reasoned findings.</PARA>
<PARA> We categorically reject any proposition that the Entertainment Centre will be viable without the Casino, unless there is substantial government funding. We do not want that funding.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an assumption made in the question about the scope and the type of abuses said to have been revealed in the deliberations of Estimates Committee E last week and the week before, as it examined the estimates for the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Indeed, it is fair to say that, while many-amounting to probably hundreds but certainly dozens-allegations were made of maladministration and corruption and a general smear about a black mafia operating throughout the distribution of funds by both departmental and Commission personnel, very few actually came to the point where substance could be fleshed out in relation to those allegations. There were many instances in the course of the hearings when the questioning fell quite flat, as I think would be acknowledged even by those who put the questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as allegations have been made which suggest either incompetence or a lack of proper procedures in relation to the provision of funds for various projects, it is quite clear that the Government is as concerned as any senator, any parliamentarian or indeed any citizen of Australia, including Aboriginal citizens of Australia, is when serious instances are alleged of misuse of funds contributed by taxpayers to advance in this case the cause of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA> For that reason the Government has taken very swift steps to further identify the sorts of matters which emerged as of concern and to remedy the situation. Indeed, so far as mismanagement has been alleged, the particular steps taken by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and concurred in and indeed announced by or certainly given publicity by the Prime Minister yesterday, indicate the vigour and the resolve with which this Government will attack any suggestions of maladministration in any portfolio, but particularly in relation to the allegations that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will know, the Auditor-General has been asked to provide special assistance in relation to an examination of the financial management of relevant Aboriginal programs within the ADC. Indeed, the Minister for Finance has also been approached by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for expert advice and assistance. I believe that the provision of that special skilled advice, which is of course additional to the constant audit to which the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is properly and normally subject, will reveal any areas of weakness that have to be dealt with and will thus provide a very firm foundation for the sorts of controls and management practices which will be required in years to come under the new administration of moneys in relation to Aboriginal affairs programs.</PARA>

The ABS index, based on actual prices from 1981 adjusted by subsequent movements in the consumer price index, shows that housing prices peaked in the September quarter at 1.030. They subsequently bottomed at 0.885-that is, 14 or 15 per cent lower-in the first quarter of 1987. They are presently below the 1981 peak.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The peak prices of September 1981 were unsustainable and they fell. I have no doubt that they will fall again, at least in real terms and possibly even in nominal terms-not the other way around, as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) misreported on the AM program yesterday morning, just as it misreported a couple of other things on the same program. It makes one wonder sometimes why $450m of taxpayers' money is spent in spreading misinformation around the community. In regard to the Housing Industry Association, Dr Silberberg was asked on that AM program to which I referred-since it was a direct voice recording, I presume the ABC got it right-about my prediction that housing prices would fall some time in the not too distant future, at least in real terms. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well there will be regional variations, we would believe, and in those markets which have exhibited the fastest growth over the past year-and that's mainly Sydney-you would have to expect that house prices would come off.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked what he meant by `come off', he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Plateau, and really there is not, on this occasion, a significant difference between HIA and Senator Walsh.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to hear that from the HIA because all speculative booms have the potential to damage both individuals and the macro-economy. The speculative boom, or the big bull run, on the stock exchange in 1987 ultimately did a lot of damage to individuals. It has not done as much damage to the economy as some people expected at the time, but speculative booms of this type are not desirable from either a whole society or an individual perspective. The less frequently they happen and the less intense they are on the odd occasion when they do happen, the better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Bureau of Industry Economics did hold the first Manufacturing Outlook Conference in Melbourne last week. Such outlook conferences have had a long tradition in the agricultural sector, and I am hopeful that last week's conference will be the start of an equally important tradition in manufacturing. The conference attracted as speakers some of Australia's foremost corporate decision makers. I think it is fair to say there was general recognition of the wide range of investment opportunities in the manufacturing sector. Speakers at the conference from various sectors of industry referred to the strong growth in manufacturing investment and exports in recent years. With continued growth in the world and domestic economies and the improved competitiveness of our manufacturers, there is every reason to believe that this growth should continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Lewis has his usual clever interjections but he ought to have a look at the figures for the growth of manufacturing investment. He can interject in here and carry on, as he always does, but the figures for growth and manufacturing investment are very encouraging, more encouraging than they ever were during the 27 years of Liberal Government in this country, more impressive. The growth in other manufacturing statistics is, of course, even more impressive still. The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, which has not always been bullish about the future of Australian industry, suggested at the conference that there could be a major boom in manufacturing investment over the next few years. It identified a number of areas with particularly bright prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One danger is to become complacent about what has been achieved and forget that much still remains to be done. In particular, more Australian companies need to think about the benefits of entering export markets. If one looks at the sectoral statements, industry by industry, one can see that corporate leaders made this point themselves at the Manufacturing Outlook Conference. Some companies already exporting still view overseas markets as somewhere to sell products that are surplus to local demand rather than a continuing part of their market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been no deliberate attempt to exclude the Department of Aboriginal Affairs from any proper surveillance by the Auditor-General. To suggest that is to misconceive the situation completely. The fact is that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is subject to continuous and proper audit of its activities, and I believe that came out during the deliberations of Estimates Committee E when many of the allegations concerning the operations of the Department-and which were, for example, partly based on a letter I think from the Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association-were refuted by the departmental officers present under intense questioning by Senator Tambling and Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those officers were able to refute those allegations and assertions with confidence, because their refutations and rejections were properly based on procedures which were devised, and which are always available for review, by the Auditor-General's Office and Department of Finance personnel. In other words, it was indicated quite clearly in Estimates Committee E that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has sufficient procedures and mechanisms in place to assess properly the propriety and managerial expertise that went into the decisions relating to the various programs for which it was responsible. It was in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission that the most intense questioning and allegations were directed by both Senator Tambling and Senator Short, and it is in relation to their allegations that the Minister thought it proper to invite the Auditor-General and the Minister for Finance to give some special assistance. I would have thought that that should be a cause for considerable satisfaction, not the suggestion of a very artificial dichotomy or contrast between the Department and the Commission as far as the Department's proper supervision by the Auditor-General is concerned.</PARA>

During hearings of Estimates Committee E his allegations and assertions concerning those management problems were dealt with by officers in a very calm and fair response to his constant questioning. The fact is that he did not come back at them. He barely laid a glove on them as far as the departmental supervision of various programs was concerned. Senator Tambling did raise some matters in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission and whilst, as I have said, they largely remain allegations they require some special procedures. I believe the Minister has shown his resolve, as has the Government, to ensure that moneys that are devoted by the Australian people to these programs are properly disbursed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It so happens that I do have in front of me the Advertiser dated 31 October 1988 in which Senator Hill put out a dire warning that `South Australia may get a downgraded and ineffective National Crime Authority office in Adelaide'. He based that on certain inferences which he drew from the course of business in Estimates Committee E. Apparently he thought that this Government and the South Australian Government were prepared to face the serious allegations concerning corruption in the police force of South Australia in relation to organised criminal activity generally in a way which would be ineffectual and indeed quite disproportionate to the problem that has been said to exist there. Indeed, I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate and, in particular, Senator Hill, that Senator Hill's fears and his raising of misgivings in the community are totally unfounded. The Attorney-General, Chris Sumner, has announced today that he has obtained the support of the Commonwealth Government, which, of course, was always available to him, to grant an additional reference to the National Crime Authority to investigate allegations of criminal activity and corruption in South Australia.

Whilst the South Australian Government, either unilaterally or without the assistance of the Commonwealth Government, cannot establish and give a reference to the NCA in Adelaide, I am confident that the intergovernmental committee, when it meets to discuss the request by South Australia, given the support of the Commonwealth and of Mr Justice Stewart of the National Crime Authority, will decide that an NCA office should be established in South Australia. The South Australian Government has put its money where its mouth is, if you like, by approving funds for the establishment and running costs of such an NCA office.

I remind the Minister that when Senator Foreman raised with him in this place in Question Time possible cuts to payroll tax and land tax in Victoria, the Minister took the view that, as Minister for Finance for the Commonwealth, he should make it clear that he would not be underwriting what he described as fiscal irresponsibility. In other words, he was prepared to describe the proposed actions of a Liberal State government in reducing taxes as irresponsible. I ask the Minister whether he regards the action of the Western Australian Government with respect to the Rothwells matter as responsible? If it costs the Western Australian Government revenue and becomes a charge on Western Australian taxpayers, what will be his attitude? Will that be regarded as responsible expenditure which the Commonwealth is obliged to underwrite or will he adopt a similar approach to the approach he adopted with respect to the far more respectable matters that were raised with him by Senator Foreman?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know what Senator Chaney calls it but I certainly call it fiscal irresponsibility-the sort of fiscal irresponsibility of which we saw a great deal, particularly in the early 1980s, in the Federal Parliament. In regard to that question I was making the point, as I recall it, that if a potential Liberal Party government in Victoria got itself into trouble the Commonwealth Government would not move in with a big heap of cash to bail it out. If the Western Australian Government gets itself into trouble-I stress that word `if'-I do not expect that the Commonwealth Government will move in to bail it out either; although I want to note for the record that, in regard to the disastrous take or pay contract to which I referred earlier, the Commonwealth Government has over a long period-if I remember correctly, this was done in 1985-agreed to forgo a good deal of revenue which would otherwise have accrued from the North West Shelf gas field.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Department and the Minister attempt to keep abreast of all defence relevant research via the Defence Science and Technology Organisation which maintains an awareness of that research. Research by itself does not contribute to verification capability. The Minister does not regard verification as an end in itself, but rather a means to further arms control. The most important arms control process after all is the reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers. That has to be the end goal. For that process to succeed, each super-power needs to be able to rely on its own verification data. Neither side would settle for less. Australia makes the unique and vital contribution to the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements by operating with the United States Government the bases at Pine Gap and Nurrungar.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A fairly close viewing of the Four Corners program-and a very interesting program it was-failed to discern any mention of the business migration program. I must say that I was pleased that the program acknowledged at the end that the vast majority of those immigrants from the Asian continent are hardworking members of the Australian community. Indeed, the crime rate amongst that community is well below the Australian average. The program provided Mr Cadman and others with an opportunity to once again regurgitate their accusations against the business migration program. This is not the first time it has occurred; it has happened several times in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that on the last occasion my predecessor invited Mr Cadman to state his accusations and to produce some evidence. This led to an interview with Mr Cadman by members of my Department and the production of absolutely no evidence whatsoever. This has not prevented him from repeating those allegations. I would like to assure everyone in the Senate that, if allegations are made and substantiated with any evidence whatsoever, I would not hesitate to have those allegations investigated. I cannot investigate shallow smears, cheap gibes and generalisations. It is absolutely impossible unless people nominate cases and areas and produce some evidence. The only evidence of malpractice that came over in the Four Corners program in relation to immigration concerned two particular individuals who came in as false refugees. They happened to come in under the Fraser Government but I do not blame the Minister of that time because there were fairly stringent screening methods and two people slipped through. One has subsequently been deported and the other is serving time in gaol at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> The sort of misrepresentation that Mr Cadman has been involved in in trying to link the Four Corners program with the business migration program has been added to by a variety of other journalists. Mr Geoffrey Simms on the 7.30 Report that night asked questions several times of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner trying to link organised crime with the business migration program. I have written to Mr Simms and asked him to produce some evidence. I look forward to his reply. Again, two days later in the Canberra Times, the bald assertion was made that the Four Corners program had alleged links between organised crime and the business migration program.

We monitor it more intensely than any other immigrant group coming to this country.

It was further suggested that such a proposal, if it was adopted on a wide enough scale, could significantly reduce the total volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and thereby help to forestall the greenhouse effect.

While I have to say that is a commendable action, it is clear that one company planting one million trees in Guatemala is not going to do a great deal for the greenhouse effect unless it is matched by thousands of similar companies all round the world. The difficulty is that forest clearing has gone on at such an extraordinary rate over the last few decades that the planting of one million trees in Guatemala is not going to be the end answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to say how pleased I was to see the announcement from Brazil, which came through last week, that it is going to cease rainforest logging. That is a great leap forward. However, if we are to look at the proposal here, I think every nation must do what it can on the question of reafforestation. With the United Nations announcement of research into the greenhouse effect, it will go up the ladder of national priorities all round the world. Here in Australia Senator Cook and I are looking at what we can do with some reafforestation in Tasmania, as a result of negotiations that we are carrying out with the Tasmanian Government that sprang from our decision on the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. Whatever Senator Cook comes up with in relation to a forest accord around Australia, it will undoubtedly involve a significant increase in reafforestation around the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Orders of the Senate contain a prohibition on Senate committees and joint committees of which senators are members meeting during sittings of the Senate. The relevant provision is now contained in new standing order 300a, which was adopted by way of a sessional order on 22 September 1987, and which relaxed the prohibition to the extent of allowing Senate and joint committees to hold only deliberative meetings in private session during sittings of the Senate. Prior to 1983, the Public Accounts Committee adhered to this rule, and, when it wished to meet during sittings of the Senate, sought the permission of the Senate to do so, as do other committees. In 1983, the Public Accounts Committee began to meet during sittings of the Senate without the permission of the Senate. It did so on the basis of a legal opinion to the effect that subsection 6 (A) (1) of the Public Accounts Committee Act, which provides for the Committee or its Chairman to determine its times and places of meeting, empowers the Committee to override the rule contained in the Senate Standing Orders. This situation was considered by the Senate Standing Orders Committee which, in a report presented on 6 October 1983, refuted the view taken by the Public Accounts Committee and recommended that, until the matter was clarified by an amendment of the Public Accounts Committee Act, the Committee should comply with the Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987, the Public Accounts Committee presented a report disputing the views of the Standing Orders Committee and reasserting its belief that it had the power to meet during the sittings of the Senate. The Standing Orders Committee, on 13 May 1987, presented a further report demonstrating that the view taken by the Public Accounts Committee was based on a number of misconceptions. The Standing Orders Committee suggested that the Senate consider whether any relaxation of the prohibition on committee meetings during sittings of the Senate should be made. The Senate considered the matter and adopted new standing order 300a, which has already been referred to.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently it came to my attention that the Public Accounts Committee was continuing to disregard the decision of the Senate and was holding public hearings during Senate sittings. The Senate having so recently made a deliberate decision as to joint committee meetings during its sittings, I considered that I had a duty to report the actions of the Public Accounts Committee to the Senate. Before doing so I wrote to the Chairman of the Committee. I table a copy of my letter and the Chairman's response. It is clear from the Chairman's letter that the Committee intends to continue to disregard the decision of the Senate. If the Public Accounts Committee persists in this attitude, it would be open to the Senate to direct that senators not attend meetings of the Committee during sittings of the Senate. I now place the matter before the Senate for its consideration. I also present to the Senate the relevant extracts from the reports to which I have referred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 October 1988, Senator Newman asked me a question without notice concerning the service allowance payable to members of the Australian Defence Force. Senator Newman will recall the question which related to a comment I made in a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal when I was Acting Minister for Industrial Relations. The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Service allowance was comprehensively reviewed last year by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal considered detailed submissions put to it on the matter by the then Defence Force Advocate, Mr David Quick, QC and the Commonwealth, and subsequently handed down in July 1987, a decision increasing the allowance by 22 per cent. In the course of its decision, the Tribunal also considered in some detail a submission from the Defence Force Advocate that payment of the allowance should be extended to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and above. The Tribunal rejected the submission, noting that the factors for which the allowance was paid to other Service members was incorporated adequately in the salary of members at these higher ranks. The Tribunal is of course an independent, expert and impartial body and the decision which it took having considered all the relevant facts must be respected. Inquiries into allowances of this kind are required to be held by the Tribunal at two-yearly intervals.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 August, Senator Chaney asked me a number of questions relating to the national wage decision and I undertook to respond after consultation with the Minister for Industrial Relations. My response is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission stated in its August national wage case decision that the structural efficiency principle would be the key element in the new system of wage fixation. This principle was designed to provide incentive and scope for parties to examine their awards. The Commission made it plain that the principle was not to be applied in a negative, cost-cutting manner. Its purpose was to facilitate the type of fundamental review necessary to ensure that existing award structures were relevant to the modern competitive needs of industry and in the best interests of management and workers. It is here that the foundation for real productivity improvements will be laid.</PARA>
<PARA> Parties gaining access to wage increases under the new wage principles are required to commit themselves formally to co-operate positively in a fundamental review of their award with a view to implementing measures to improve the efficiency of industry and provide workers with access to more varied, fulfilling and better paid jobs. Such reviews are to be monitored and assisted as necessary by the Commission. Moreover, in February 1989 the Commission will be convening hearings to consider detailed reports on progress on individual award reviews in order to monitor the effectiveness of the system and consider any matters of general principle requiring resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental review of awards envisaged under the new wage system is expected to result in substantial productivity improvements over time. Given the magnitude of the changes involved, implementation of restructuring and other changes will take considerable time and the benefits for efficiency and productivity will be generated over the medium to longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the substance of the answer which Senator Chaney sought, by way of question, on 30 August. On 28 October, Senator Chaney wrote me a letter on the matter seeking further information. There is a further part of the answer which I seek to have incorporated in Hansard</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Wage increases in the initial stages of the new system have been flowing somewhat faster than originally anticipated. However, in the absence of wage data for even the first quarter of 1988/89 it is too early to suggest that Budget forecasts need revision. Moreover, the flow of wage increases is indicative of substantial improvements in industrial relationships between employers and unions. The parties are building on the positive experience of second tier bargaining by agreeing to wage increases that create a favourable climate for the major review of industrial awards now in train as part of the new system.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to its own employees, the Government has taken note of the Commission's direction that the operative dates for wage increases should be negotiated between the parties and have regard to the circumstances in the particular awards or sectors concerns. In that context, and having regard to the Government's wages policy and to the budgetary implications of early payment of the wage increases, the Government argued that most salary increases for its employees should not apply before mid-October 1988. This view has been accepted by the Commission which has emphasised the need for a staggered approach to the granting of wage rises. A similar approach has been adopted where the Commonwealth accepts responsibility for funding. However this date has been departed from where special circumstances existed.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Department of Social Security raises, as is always the case in annual reports of this Department, a great many matters which the Senate has to address. I would like to comment on the first part of the report, which is headed `The Portfolio'. It is a large portfolio, of course, because the Department affects the lives of many individual Australians. In that section there is a list of policy and administrative changes during 1987-88, the period covered by this report, and a list of what are suggested to be highlights. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, to some of the Department's highlights. The first concerns the implementation in July 1987 of an increase in the free area-that is, the permissible income for pensioners-from $30 to $40 a week for single pensioners and from $50 to $70 a week for married couples. The Senate should be reminded that this highlight was a lowlight for pensioners in that this increase was promised in 1986 and was delayed as a result of the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government in October 1986 during the Budget session. So pensioners had to wait for the increase until July 1987, having suffered in 1986 a Christmas of some deprivation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further highlight in that list concerns indexation increases in most rates of pension and benefit. The indexation increase was delayed by six weeks, a delay that has never been made up by the Government, which now has a quite massive Budget surplus and which has not seen fit to do anything about the delays caused to pensioners, who are not exactly on a gravy train and whose support the Government is now saying that it wants to win back. I draw the attention of the Government to some letters in this morning's Australian. One pensioner pointed out that his income is only $244 a fortnight. In spite of these so-called highlights, that remains the case and needs to be addressed by the Government. That point was made by Bettina Cass in her report, which no doubt will receive a lot of our attention in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> Other highlights draw out further anomalies in the Government's policy. One refers to the beginning of the phasing-out in July 1987 of the class B widow's pension when the youngest dependent child reaches the age of 16-presumably on the basis that a 16-year-old is no longer a dependent child. Yet on the next page of the report another highlight refers to the introduction of the job search allowance in January 1988, with an activity test and a parental income test, and the removal of the unemployment benefit for those aged under 18. Presumably dependence continues until the age of 18 under that measure, so there is a credibility gap with regard to when dependency occurs in the eyes of this Government. Obviously, in terms of paying the parents, for the sole parent, usually a woman, dependency finishes when the child reaches the age of 16; but in the case of the unemployment benefit the age is 18. So there is a distinct anomaly which the Government needs to address. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 14 of the report is entitled `Improving payment administration'. I point out that one of the areas in which most recovery of so-called overpayments has taken place is the supporting parent benefit area. Enormous concerns have been expressed by groups in the community about questions of classification of de facto relationships. I submit that this is a very delicate area and that women in the community struggling on their own to bring up children are suffering great disadvantage. The new review teams leave a lot to be desired, and guidelines for their operation should be implemented in the schedule to the Act in order to ensure that field officer activities are properly monitored and are satisfactory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Social Security annual report 1987-88 undoubtedly would provide good reading, if only I had had time to read the whole document. However, I did turn to it to get some insight into what the Department had to tell us about the unemployment benefit. The report tells us very little about the unemployment benefit. The reason I turned to the report was the recent announcement by the Government that a committee is to be established to coordinate Government policy for young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unemployment benefit is a policy area which undoubtedly directly impacts on young Australians and comes under the Department of Social Security umbrella. The need for unemployment benefit, of course, is affected by other policy areas, not the least of which is education and training. Presumably all parliamentarians share the common goal of reducing not only the number of people who are reliant on unemployment benefit but also the duration of time on unemployment benefit, not purely because of cost but, more particularly, because of the period during which people have to suffer the indignity of not being able to get a job when they want one. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of young Australians, the unemployment benefit, and what we should be doing about the problem of high numbers of young Australians needing unemployment benefit reminds me of a scheme launched in August-September 1985 called the Priority One scheme. I am sure Government senators remember it well. At that time the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised to provide 70,000 traineeship in our bicentennial year: that happens to be this year, 1988. Yet if one looks at statistics to see how many young Australians are benefiting from the Priority One scheme by the provision of traineeships, one will see that 15,000 traineeships is the target for this year. I do not need to labour the point. Thankfully, after some time the Government realised the error of its ways and has admitted the Priority One scheme was a failure; that expectations of young Australians were raised most unfairly; and that it was not able to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in one sense pleased to take part in the debate to criticise the Priority One scheme. I said that it was purely Government public relations, it was media hype, it was simply selling the Government, and that not enough thought had gone into it. Because not enough had gone into it, the traineeships would not eventuate and there would still be young Australians on unemployment benefit. As I say, thankfully the Government admits that failure, but it has done something else, as I mentioned earlier. It has announced a committee to coordinate Government policy for young Australians. I do not complain about that. I hope that policy for young Australians is properly coordinated. However, this is the sixth year of office of this Government. Six years on, the Government is trying to tell young Australians that it is making a genuine attempt to coordinate policy on their behalf. Proper working groups are to be set up to consult with young Australians and with those volunteer groups who play a part in helping young Australians in order to obtain their views. </PARA>
<PARA> It all sounds very similar. The name tag `Priority One' has gone and, thankfully, the publicity to advertise the Government, rather than doing something sensible for young Australians, has also gone. Nonetheless, we still have the noises of consultation. You will remember, Mr Deputy President, the Priority One phone-in-commonly referred to by young Australians as `squawk to Hawke'. We have had consultations and a number of surveys. Young Australians have been consulted ad infinitum. I think we are entitled, in the sixth year of this Government, to ask what it will do to coordinate policy. We do not just want to hear that a committee will be set up. The Government has had six years to look at this area. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government takes some notice of this very short term advice, perhaps we will find in the Department of Social Security annual report next year something more about the unemployment benefit than a simple outline of what category one has to come under to obtain the benefit. Hopefully, we will see something about what the Government has done to ensure that fewer and fewer young Australians require the unemployment benefit and that those who do require the unemployment benefit do so for a lesser period than is the case now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on the annual report of the Department of Social Security. The Department's annual report has been presented to the Senate today, and I believe on Thursday of this week Estimates committees are to report to the Senate. That must mean that this report has been nearly available over the past couple of weeks, when Estimates committees have been meeting. I understand that there was a draft of the report available for the Estimates committee which dealt with the Department, which means that six honourable senators were privileged to see it at the relevant time but the rest of us were precluded from doing so because we did not receive the report until today. I think it is a matter that the Government, and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in particular, ought to give their attention to and see that reports such as this are available to all senators prior to Senate Estimates committees meeting so everyone has an opportunity to look at them. Of course, I guess even those on the Estimates committee in question have not yet had an opportunity to see whether the draft is in fact the same as the document presented today.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw the Senate's attention to a couple of aspects of the annual report of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation. First, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is involved in one or two rather important efforts to improve the efficiency of converting livestock to meat. I hope that the Government does not see fit to cut back funding to the CSIRO in this area, as it has for all sorts of reasons in other areas around Australia. The CSIRO, in studying beef conversion cost reduction, as it is called, has for several years been looking at a new method of slaughtering and dressing cattle at its research laboratories. It is finding that by using mechanical methods of cutting up meat, slaughtering is becoming more efficient. As we all realise, one of the dearest components of any manual industry is the labour itself. Bringing automation into the slaughtering operation will reduce not only the heavy strains on the slaughtermen themselves but also the cost factor. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also notes that there has been quite a deal of work done on improving meat inspection. Meat inspection has been brought to the notice of everyone in this Senate over the last 12 months, particularly as a result of organochlorins in meat. There certainly needs to be more study into and work on a more efficient meat inspection system. In particular, the annual report notes that the Corporation is looking at a concept called total quality assurance which, if it comes to pass, will revolutionise the whole meat inspection procedure. The interesting point is that it is a similar concept to that used by the Japanese for car inspections. One might ask what the two industries have in common, but I suppose at the end of the day the most important thing is that we improve quality. As well, this total quality assurance system will reduce inspection costs by between 30 and 50 per cent. The Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation is looking at that at the moment. I wish it the best of success with that project. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to bring to the notice of the Senate another innovative idea involving enhancing the value of skins, hides and by-products. If successful, this project could revolutionise the Australian tanning industry, and it is hoped that this practice will begin next year. It involves a prototype laser machine being developed for the fellmongering process, and if that laser technology is successful it will remove the pollution problems encountered in fellmongering. It will reduce the time required for the tanning process from hours to minutes. If it is successful, it will open up a new industry to Australia-the downstreaming of hides. That certainly needs to have more work done on it. I hope that that system does come to fruition. As I mentioned before, the CSIRO, as stated in the report, is involved in quite a few areas of research, not the least of which is the program to release insects for the biological control of Paterson's curse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation on its annual report and on its efforts to assist with the promotion and marketing of meat in Australia and also overseas. As I read the report I noted particularly the work being put into the export market for our meat. There has been a worldwide recovery in agricultural commodity prices, and this increase has provided a sound basis for record shipments and export returns. I know that all people on properties with cattle have been glad to have better prices during the past 12 months for cattle sold both in Australia and on the export market. In 1987-88 Australia exported a total of 833,425 tonnes of meat. That included 615,853 tonnes of beef and veal, and 153,286 tonnes of lamb and mutton. This was an increase on last year of 11 per cent for beef and veal exports. The value of export sales reached new records, and no doubt this is due in no small way to the better prices producers have been able to achieve. Producers made $2,035m from beef and veal, and $298m from lamb and mutton.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne might be right too. There is no doubt that producers on properties need better prices to make ends meet, because our rural people have to put up with many problems. As a wife who pays the regular monthly fuel bills on our property, I can say that there is no doubt that fuel costs are always going up. The burden of fuel costs is so heavy that sometimes I wonder how people on the land who do not have any extra income can possibly make ends meet. I believe we need a real freight equalisation scheme for the people living in rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States remains Australia's largest export market for beef. We have always been grateful for that, and we do not want to see our American market reduced. We have to fight to make sure that we keep up the standards of our beef, and of our meat of all descriptions, so that America will continue to want to purchase it. Japan is also beginning to use quite a lot of beef. I can well remember visiting some of the cities of Japan some years ago. At one place in particular the people strongly believed in making sure that the beef was very tender. They had a very unusual way of doing this. They kept the cattle in a great big place in the centre of the city, gave each animal a bottle of beer each day, and then blew saki onto them and rubbed it into them in order to make the lovely beef that the Japanese really seemed to enjoy. I do not know whether Australia has gone that far to try to make sure we produce the sort of beef that the Japanese like. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the interesting points that should be noted when we consider the annual report of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation and the tremendous work it is doing. I also notice that on page 24 of the report, the Corporation refers to its tremendous advertising and promotion campaign to make sure that people in Australia realise that meat is good value. Of course, there has been a lot of talk about not eating too much meat. We are told we should eat more white meat and fish. But there is no doubt that the beef producers and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation are doing a tremendous job trying to promote the sale of beef throughout Australia and overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the annual report 1987-88 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation, I wish to comment, in the brief time I have, on the review of the research and development program. One of the tragedies of Australia is that the Australian Labor Party has such a profound ignorance about the place of research in and the value of research to Australian industry and, thereby, the Australian community. We have seen the huge cuts in research and development funding to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and, of course, the war that is running in the universities at present is in part fuelled by the cuts to research programs within those universities. I suppose the Government's narrow vision of what society is all about comes from the trade union background, but money spent on research and development comes back both to the Government and to the community many times over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that in 1985 the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation set up its research and development division and the five categories listed in this report are a logical and intelligent approach to the whole side of meat production. The first category is about acquiring knowledge about markets, which is essential. The second is about improving the efficiency of converting livestock to meat, which deals with slaughtering processes and so on. The third is about improving the efficiency of livestock production. The fourth is about improving product range, quality and marketability. The fifth is about improved management and the research and development program. All of those categories are essential to the Australian rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment particularly on category 3, dealing with improving the efficiency of livestock production. That is something on which we have a proud record of achievement in Australia, particularly the research that has been done in association with the CSIRO. The Meat and Livestock Corporation is in partnership with the CSIRO on some projects-for example, on new methods of slaughtering and dressing cattle, the development of immuno-castration vaccines, the biological control of Paterson's curse, the improvement of productivity of cattle, especially those in the northern parts of Australia, and pasture improvement in northern Australia. The source of production for the export markets for Australia-and those export markets in beef are very important-happen to lie mainly in Queensland and, to a lesser degree, in the Northern Territory-in other words, they are in the tropical regions. There is need for continual research to develop and improve our productivity in those regions. </PARA>
<PARA> An essential part of this is the CSIRO, but what have we seen with respect to this Government's actions in supporting the CSIRO in its most essential form? We have seen a marked policy to drive the CSIRO out of rural research in Australia, to reduce it to the point of absolute impotence. For the sixth year in succession the CSIRO has received a budget cut in real terms. We have had the dissembling of the Leader of this Government in the Senate (Senator Button) who says that the CSIRO is getting the same sort of money. If that is so, why have hundreds and hundreds of scientists left the CSIRO? They have left because there is no budget funding for them. In the last couple of years CSIRO has lost more than 200 professional staff. In my own State of Queensland, the Division of Soils Laboratory, an essential part of pasture management, has been closed, and the Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures has just suffered massive cuts. This is an absurd position for Australia. Queensland produces 40 per cent of Australia's beef production, of which 74 per cent is exported, compared with an average Australia figure of 57 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have markets. We sell in those markets on quality and price. We get no subsidy in any way at all. We have markets opening up in Japan and Korea, and the only way this country will get out of the debt that this Government has taken us into-from $32 billion when it came into office, to in excess of $120 billion today-is by selling products for profit overseas. All the tax cuts and incentives that the Government might talk about really do not do a thing to diminish the debt. It can only be diminished by our producing efficiently and selling overseas. The place of research in that is absolutely crucial. This Government has to recognise that for every dollar it puts into the CSIRO, for every dollar it puts into Australian meat and livestock research programs for rural research, it will reap a reward 10 times or 100 times more than what it puts in. If it does not put that money in, we will lose our markets. </PARA>

First, however, I wish to compliment the Corporation on the quick action, to which its report refers, which it took, along with a number of other relevant organisations, at the time of the pesticide crisis in the beef industry last year. The report notes that there was an allocation of $500,000 at very short notice at that time which made a useful contribution to the alleviation of that crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Objective No. 4 relates to improving product range, quality and marketability. Obviously this is a critical area for a corporation in any industry, but particularly in the meat and livestock industry. I note that many of the projects referred to here as being funded within this objective are projects designed to look in the long term at the problems facing the meat industry in relation to the use of chemicals. These projects are many and various and are to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to what I regard as a key initiative in the area of marketability and improving product range which, to this point at least, is not receiving support from the Research Corporation or from the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) itself. Coincidentally, an aspect of this initiative appears in an article in the `Epicure' section of today's Age, to which I draw the attention of honourable senators. The initiative is being developed by Ron O'Dwyer, whom the article describes as `a former Elders executive'. It is an initiative to market a product called `High Country Beef'. Also coincidentally, Mr O'Dwyer visited me in my office last week to tell me something about his project, so I was particularly interested in the article by Gayle Austen today. It points out that Mr O'Dwyer, who was first a butcher and then moved through other areas of the meat industry, is an experienced marketer who has taken the view that there is a market out there for a product which can be demonstrated to the consumers to be clean. He obviously sees what is now a trend throughout this country and throughout the world. The Australian Democrats submit that he is not getting the support he should be receiving from the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation and the AMLC itself. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of holders of judicial office and the president and members of the Inter-State Commission. These recommendations are contained within the Remuneration Tribunal's 1987 review which I tabled in the Parliament on 25 February 1988. The recommendations included increases to allowances based on consumer price index movements and a second tier wage adjustment. Section 72 of the Constitution provides that remuneration for these offices shall be fixed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second tier salary adjustment, I am satisfied that the changes to practices and procedures in the various courts and tribunals in the federal jurisdiction, together with changes in the value of work of the office-holders, justify an increase of 3 per cent in conformity with the National Wage Case principles. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 deals with increases in the expense of office allowance for the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island, president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, president of the Trade Practices Tribunal and members of the Inter-State Commission. Clause 4 deals with increases to rates of travelling allowance payable to the Chief Justice and Justices of the High Court of Australia. Clause 5 provides an increase to the additional allowance payable to Justices of the High Court who are not resident in or near the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 increases travelling allowance paid to holders of certain offices and amends provisions relating to the costs incurred in an overnight stay. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 provides an increase in travelling allowance payable to the president and members of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill provides for the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1984 to be amended to provide for increases to the expense of office allowance and to salary payable in respect of the offices reported upon by the Remuneration Tribunal. The salaries have been increased by the second tier adjustment and recent National Wage Case increases of 10 March 1987 ($10.00) and 5 February 1988 ($6.00) which were passed on automatically in accordance with an earlier decision of the Tribunal and as provided for in the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of implementing the Tribunal's recommendations in respect of judges and the president and members of the Inter-State Commission will be of the order of $1.2m in 1988-89. Further information on the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which is being circulated to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to five Bounty Acts and one Subsidy Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's major purpose is to make amendments to the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981, and the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981, and the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977;</PARA>
<PARA>II) To extend the life of the first two Bounty schemes until 30 June 1995, as part of the Government's post 1988 textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) plan; and to implement the phasing-down of assistance under the schemes to a final rate of 30%, as announced in that plan and the 25 May 1988 economic statement, (Clause 4, Schedule 1); and</PARA>
<PARA>II) To increase the maximum annual amount of Bounty available for payment under the third scheme as announced in the (TCF) plan, from $600,000 to $3.2 million, commencing on 1 March 1989 and operating until 28 February 1993 when the scheme will be reviewed (Clause 4, Schedule 1). </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Government's post 1988 TCF plan, the Bounty rate for the Printed Fabric Bounty, (which is paid for the printing of certain apparel fabrics) was originally scheduled to be phased down from 56% to 30% by the end of the plan i.e. 1 March 1996. However, as part of the changes announced by the Government in the May economic statement, it was decided to shorten the TCF plan by eight months, i.e. the plan is now to operate until 30 June 1995. Accordingly, the phasing period originally proposed in the TCF plan has been recalculated so that the 30% end point is reached by that date. This Bill proposes amendments to the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981 in schedule 1 to the Bill, to give legislative effect to this segment of the TCF plan. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Textile Yarns Bounty, the TCF plan proposed that all products eligible to receive bounty under the Bounty Scheme would be paid at a uniform rate of 30% by 1 March 1994. The only amendment to the timetable for the phased amendments to existing rates of bounty announced in the TCF plan relates to the pace of reduction in bounty assistance for continuous filament polyamide and polyester yarns. Under the TCF plan the rate of bounty was to be reduced from the current 47.5% of factory cost value added to 45% on 1 March 1989, with a reduction to 37.5% on 1 March 1993, and a final drop to 30% on 1 March 1994. In the May Economic Statement the Government decided to slightly accelerate the reduction, and it is now proposed to reduce the amount of bounty payable to 42.5% on 1 March 1989, then to 35% on 1 March 1993 before finally reaching 30% on 1 March 1994. Further, similar to the Printed Fabrics Bounty, this scheme is to operate until 30 June 1995. The proposed amendments to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 in Schedule 1 to the Bill give legislative effect to this segment of the TCF plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendment to existing legislation that is necessary to implement the Government's TCF plan is the proposed amendment to the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977. This Bill proposes to increase the maximum amount of bounty that may be appropriated to that scheme by Parliament in any one twelve month period from $600,000 per annum to $3,200,000 per annum, until the scheme ends on 28 February 1993. This increased annual ceiling will assist the revitalisation of this important industry in the TCF sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above, a number of technical drafting amendments to clarify or effect consequential changes to two bounty schemes and one subsidy scheme are proposed. These are set out in detail in the Bill's explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The proposed extension of the Textile Yarn and Printed Fabric Bounties is expected to result in total bounty outlays for both of these schemes of about $300 million over the 3 financial years 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. This figure incorporates the estimated savings arising from the changes announced by the Government in the post-1988 TCF plan and the May 25 Economic Statement of $0.8 million in 1988-89, $4.0 million in 1989-90 and $5.5 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Bed Sheeting Bounty will require the Commonwealth to outlay a maximum of $12.8 million between 1 March 1989 and 28 February 1993. The 4 month bounty period 1 November 1988 to 28 February 1989 is subject to a ceiling of $200,000 (a pro-rating of the current $600,000 ceiling for 4 months). </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the other bounty schemes and the amendment to the subsidy scheme have no direct financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.26)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately a Government Bill, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988, and a motion by Senator Powell to set up a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. This debate has clearly demonstrated the deviousness of this Government and its capacity for political expediency at the expense of common sense and, in this case, at the expense of the primary producers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 is acceptable. It is an attempt to provide national legislation for the clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. But the proposal by Senator Powell to establish the select committee is not acceptable to the Opposition parties. The Government is supporting Senator Powell's proposal. The Opposition parties have challenged the Government to deny that it is supporting Senator Powell's proposal in exchange for the votes of the Australian Democrats for the Government's resource rent tax, which was passed some time ago. The Government has agreed to bring forward Senator Powell's proposal. That was the quid pro quo. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has acknowledged, he has been, to use his word, `dragged' into support of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is the Government that I turn to. I draw attention to the fact that not one Government senator has yet spoken in support of the proposal for the establishment of the select committee. It is my belief that not one Government senator, except perhaps the Minister who is responsible for the Bill, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), will speak in support of it. So far not even the Minister has said anything in favour of the establishment of the committee. I suspect that, if he gets a chance during his final summing up of this debate, he will still avoid indicating any support for the establishment of the committee. The Government cannot avoid the fact that all the Government senators, notwithstanding the fact that they have not spoken in favour of the establishment of the committee, will in due course vote in its favour. </PARA>
<PARA> Government senators will vote in favour of the establishment of the committee despite the fact that the establishment of the committee is opposed not only by the Liberal and National parties in this place but also by the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Wool Council of Australia, the Australian Horticultural Growers Council, the Australian Council of Egg Producers, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry. All of these bodies have publicly made known their total opposition to the establishment of the committee. But, as I said, Government senators will support its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> The general view of all these bodies is that such an inquiry can achieve very little in the way of positive resolutions for Australian consumers or for the agricultural sector. Indeed, it has the potential to cause great harm to Australia's hard-earned reputation as a world leader in the production of clean agricultural products. The Australian Agricultural Council is already conducting an inquiry into the use of chemicals on farms. The Government's own science body, the Australian Science and Technology Council, is currently conducting an inquiry into farm chemical use in Australia. It is believed that that Council will report to the Government before the end of this year. Surely even the Government can see the merit in deferring the establishment of this committee until after its own council, the Australian Science and Technology Council, has reported to it on the subject? We have not been able to persuade the Government to go along that path. Notwithstanding the fact that no senator on the Government side is prepared to speak in favour of the establishment of the committee, we cannot persuade the government to oppose its establishment and we cannot persuade the Government to defer its establishment. This clearly indicates the nature of the arrangement Mr Kerin entered into with the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Again let me make it perfectly clear that the Opposition parties totally oppose the establishment of this committee. We acknowledge that there are some in the community who question the use of chemicals in food production and that that questioning extends to the use of chemicals in food production worldwide. But I believe that most Australians would agree with Minister Kerin that the benefits of the controlled use of chemicals in Australia have been justified. The Government has told us that the increasing complexity of chemicals and the realities of international trade require a more extensive regulatory framework governing the clearance and registration of such chemicals, and the Bill, which we are debating cognately with the committee proposal, is an attempt to provide that framework. Apparently the Australian Agricultural Council recommended a legislative approach and the Minister has advised us that this legislation is based on the detailed considerations of a working party of that Council and on earlier recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill, but I point out that we have reservations as to whether this is the best way of achieving these aims, particularly in view of the difficulty with Queensland and the concerns of industry. The Queensland Government has indicated that it would be prepared to support a coordinated, cooperative system of agricultural and veterinary chemicals clearance and registration. But-and surely it could not be criticised for this-it said that it was not prepared to cede its constitutional rights and authority to register or not register and to deregister, recall or, if necessary, ban a chemical on its own initiative where it believed the State's interests so warranted. The Queensland Minister for Primary Industries indicated that approach to Minister Kerin. He sent to Mr Kerin an alternative proposal-that is, an alternative to the proposal set out in the schedule to the Bill. At the last report I had, Mr Kerin had not even bothered to respond to the Queensland Minister. As a result, Queensland will operate independently of the program. That is a pity because the whole program is put forward on the basis that it will be a cooperative arrangement between the Commonwealth on the one hand and the States on the other hand. Yet Minister Kerin knows that, as a result of his failure to negotiate with the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Queensland will not be cooperating in the scheme. That will present major difficulties, especially for the chemical companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also say that the Bill does nothing to address the current bottlenecks in obtaining clearances of new products, and the need for time periods for evaluation and the grant of clearance by the Council remain an omission in the Bill. The Opposition parties are suspicious and concerned that this legislation will lead to further significant delays, although the intention is to hasten the approval of products and allegedly to arrange for an evaluation of the products in a timely and efficient manner. As I have said, the stated object of this legislation is to streamline the clearance and registration procedures relating to crop protection and animal health products marketed in Australia. However, there are already substantial delays in the registration of such products. Indeed, it appears likely in our view that the delays will lengthen with the introduction of this Bill. The worst bottleneck appears to be the under-resourcing of the Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. This body is the responsibility of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and it is in as big a mess as the rest of that Minister's Department. I find it quite extraordinary that he has not been able to find time to discuss this shambles with industry representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties support the stated objective of the Bill but, as I have indicated, we reject totally the need for a Senate select committee as wasteful of the resources of the Senate, as an unnecessary duplication of the investigations of the Australian Science and Technology Council, and as a waste of taxpayers' funds. In our view, it is disgraceful that the votes of Australian Labor Party senators will establish this committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. Senator Lewis's remarks, just completed, and I might add, the remarks of many other members of the Opposition in this debate, have referred specifically to negotiations on the question of the establishment of the committee which is the subject of this debate. Since I am the person who negotiated with the Government on this matter I claim to have been misrepresented. It is not the case that any deal has been done with the Government in relation to resource rent tax legislation. As I have said, I am the person who negotiated Government support for my motion on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I certainly had discussions with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. That is the natural course of events between all parties in this place, as Senator Lewis would understand, since his Party is at the moment in heated negotiation-hopefully, progressive negotiation-with the Government on a number of pieces of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the person involved, it is a misrepresentation of my position to say that any such deal has been done in relation to a resource rent tax-a matter which has been Australian Democrats policy since December 1978. It should not surprise the Opposition that the Democrats supported that piece of legislation. This support for the establishment of an agricultural and veterinary chemicals committee is the result of negotiations, but it has nothing to do with the resource rent tax; rather it has to do with the future of the agricultural industry of Australia and it arose in the course of discussions in relation to this piece of legislation, which we were all expecting much earlier this year and which the Democrats regret has taken so long to come before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator Lewis stated the obvious when he said that some people question the use of chemicals in food production. Of course they do. We do not need to question whether they should be used for quite obviously there is universal agreement that they are appropriate if used correctly. We pose further questions: not only whether they should be used but when, why, how and to what degree. They are all relevant and responsible questions which need to be asked now and continue to be asked not only by any authorities that already exist but by any that may be created in the future. In fact, we are being alerted to the possibility that there could be no more relevant questions to be asked as we move into an age in which we are confronted with a series of syndromes and diseases which are new to us and which probably reflect both the use and abuse of chemicals for agricultural and veterinary purposes. So it is a question of benefits versus costs versus dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> Any community that does not address that relationship and that ratio is utterly irresponsible. It is ridiculous and irresponsible of the Opposition to suggest that we do not have, first of all, the obligation and, secondly, the right to put in place committees and mechanisms which will address precisely that process. The committee proposal is probably only the first step towards much more sophisticated and much more wide-reaching monitoring mechanisms in this country. If we have any influence on the process they will become much more far-reaching than is proposed initially in this first committee proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines referred to my own community, the central coast of New South Wales, and to what appears to be an aberration which may reveal a link between chronic fatigue syndrome and exposure to toxic chemicals, perhaps in the food chain. On Thursday in a question she said that four doctors from the east coast of this continent-only one of whom is from the central coast-have undertaken and have begun to report a study which alerts the Parliament, the Senate and, hopefully, this committee and any structures that are created as a result of it to the fact that we may be moving into extremely difficult times in the application of chemicals in agriculture and in the pastoral industries generally. </PARA>
<PARA> These four doctors have begun a study which, presumably, will be ongoing. They sent to the United States of America 41 blood samples from people who were exhibiting the chronic fatigue syndrome. It was acknowledged by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in this place on Thursday of the last sitting week that it is generally accepted that it has affected 16,000 Australians. The samples were sent to the United States of America because we are not capable of doing the pathology tests here. Of the 41 samples sent to the United States 38 showed residues of at least one pesticide or solvent. On average three pesticides and five solvents were detected in the samples. DDE, which is a breakdown product of DDT, was detected in every one of the blood samples analysed. There was a moderate but significant correlation between the chemicals tested. That is people high in one chemical were likely to show high levels of residual toxicity from other chemicals as well. </PARA>
<PARA> These four practitioners, who do not claim expertise in toxicology, sent their samples to the United States, the experts in the world. They have subsequently sent another 56 samples, the results of which are likely to be known in the next 48 hours. They are alerting us to the fact that we could be moving into an extremely challenging era as far as these toxic residues are concerned. They admit that they are clinicians and not toxicologists. However, they have passed these samples to an authority that is representative of the Center for Disease Control of Atlanta and the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. It has on it representatives of government toxicology authorities, prominent immunologists, prominent immunopathologists, prominent toxicological pathologists and representatives of government medical agencies that are charged with the investigation of such matters in the United States. </PARA>

We do not have any authority in this country that is capable of doing such studies. The fact that the honourable senator is frightened of the outcome of such studies is a function of his irresponsibility and the irresponsibility of those who are being represented and whose cases are being advocated by the likes of Senator Lewis in this debate. It is nothing short of utter irresponsibility to suggest that we should not have in this country the authorities to carry out such toxicological studies on our behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My role in this debate is a brief one. It is simply to alert the Senate, to alert the Government, to alert the Australian public to the fact that right now on the east coast of this country we have evidence that we may be on the forward edge of a major problem. The Opposition is advocating that we put our heads in the sand and ignore the problem. It is possibly one of the greatest challenges that is confronting the industries that Senator Panizza says he is representing. If we lose our clean image in our primary industries we will be shooting the very people that he claims to be representing in this chamber. I have never seen such a contradiction of position nor have I heard such irresponsibility as that which has come out of the mouth of Senator Lewis especially, on the three occasions he has seized the opportunity to put this irresponsible position in the debate. I felt obliged to reveal to the Senate, to the Australian public and to the Government the fact that they have before them glaring evidence of the need for such a committee and for that committee to be step one towards establishing much more comprehensive agencies to act on our behalf. The Australian Democrats undertake to consider the suitability of any existing legislation in the United States and, in the form of a private member's Bill if necessary, to place it in parallel before this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on behalf of the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, who is absent today. The subject of agricultural and veterinary chemicals is a large and very controversial one. There can be no doubt that the availability and use of agrochemicals has contributed significantly to agricultural production and to the prosperity of this country. The control and certain insect-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and sleeping sickness has become possible only with the introduction of modern insecticides. It is essential to remember that the very safest pesticides must be used carefully and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions if adverse effects are to be avoided. Even then it is necessary to monitor their use closely to ensure that unintended and unforeseen effects do not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate on this issue over recent weeks has focused on two issues: firstly the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and, secondly, the proposal that there be a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reiterate the objectives of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. They are, firstly, to protect and enhance trade and commerce in agricultural produce and livestock; secondly, to assist in the conduct of agricultural and veterinary oper- ations in all or any of the Territories; thirdly, to minimise any undue hazard, to the public, the environment, users and agricultural produce and livestock, from the application of chemical products in accordance with recommendations for their use; fourthly, to minimise the need for separate evaluation of chemical products by the registering authorities of States and Territories; fifthy, to ensure that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are effective in the uses for which they are cleared; and, sixthly, to ensure that evaluations of chemical products are carried out in a timely and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will provide the basis of the Commonwealth-State clearance process which ensures that efficacy, public and occupational health and environmental impact are fully evaluated prior to approval, that claims made by manufactures can be substantiated and that there are no unintended side effects from the use of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. Research by governments, industry and private sector research bodies into chemicals already in use is ongoing and the clearance authority will have improved access to the results of that very important work. </PARA>
<PARA> The clearance process ensures that agricultural and veterinary chemicals approved for use within Australia will perform as claimed and will not jeopardise the quality, or indeed the very production of crops and livestock. Only safe and quality products are approved for marketing and then only under strict conditions of use. This legislative approach has been endorsed by the Australian Agricultural Council and all States have participated in its development and will continue to do so in its administration. As Senator Bjelke-Petersen noted, the Bill requires that the Commonwealth and States enter into an agreement to ensure that Commonwealth and State roles are well defined and complementary. I hope that the doubts of Senator Lewis about Queensland's participation are not based on fact. I feel sure that Senator Bjelke-Petersen would ensure that Queensland was cooperating in this vital matter. Continued Commonwealth-State cooperation can be assured and will be vital to the successful administration of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The goal in controlling agricultural and veterinary chemicals is to ensure that primary producers and, indeed, all segments of society are offered maximum protection from possible adverse effects but, at the same time, are not denied the benefits that such chemicals can offer. The clearance and registration process enables government to exercise control over availability, levels of use, claims, labelling and packaging and also provides reassurance to the public that agrochemicals are safe providing they are used correctly and responsibly. It will be the responsibility of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council established under the legislation to ensure that these control measures are in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by Opposition comments that it supports the Bill and the objectives it seeks to pursue which the Government believes will improve the assessment and control procedures to the benefit of primary producers and the wider community. The international community will also see that the Commonwealth is playing a positive and purposeful role in agrochemicals regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the debate has been the merit-or otherwise-of a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. It has been argued that the introduction of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill coupled with the current Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) study into chemical residues in agricultural products makes such an inquiry unnecessary. That clearance and registration play a central role in the control of pesticides is not in doubt. Pesticide registration and control of pesticides, however, are not synonymous and although clearance and registration are essential components of the control process their limitations should also be emphasised. Therefore, legislative control is only one component of the proposed select committee's terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the Opposition's argument no one has thought it necessary to clearly define the purpose and scope of the ASTEC study. It is a study into chemical residues in agricultural products. In undertaking its review ASTEC is to consider: the national and international mechanisms to ensure that appropriate standards are developed; the national and international implementation of those standards; whether residues are a cause for consumer concern; the opportunities for the development of new analytical techniques and/or new and safer agricultural and veterinary chemicals through strategic research; other opportunities for contributions through strategic research such as the development of decontamination methods; and the potential for the contamination of agricultural products through the non-agricultural use of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Its objective is therefore the consideration of residues and their implications for consumers and international trade and it will provide a sound base for the select committee to work from. As I have already said the use of chemicals in agriculture is a large and controversial subject which extends beyond the clearance and registration process and residues in food. It is these other areas such as environmental protection, social and economic impact, alternative pest control strategies, integrated pest management techniques and non-chemical pest control measures, all of which have strengths and limitations, that the inquiry will also focus upon. The Government supports the inquiry because it does go further than registration and residues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejected the Opposition sponsored witch-hunt into the beef residue crisis a few months ago. The Government saw no point in dredging up 20-year-old issues such as dibromochloropropane of the Industrial Bio-test Laboratories (IBT) affair which resulted in improved standards of good laboratory practice. In respect of Australia, they have been largely laid to rest with the removal of products implicated with IBT Laboratories or the provision of replacement toxicology studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also hope, and I anticipate that it will be the case, that the inquiry is forward looking and constructive and will seek to address important issues such as the social costs of pesticide use; the practicality of alternative pest control strategies; the adequacy of research into biological and integrated pest management techniques applicable to Australia; the possible effects of chemicals on air, water and soil; as well as the benefits that are derived from chemical use and which are seldom documented or acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> An inquiry concentrating on old but evergreen chemical issues will be unproductive, but one along constructive lines will be a challenge and will demonstrate to the community and other countries that we have the maturity and technical competence to openly discuss controversial agrochemical issues which are of concern, not only to Australia, but to all countries where agricultural and veterinary chemicals are important elements in agricultural production. Improvements and innovation are not encouraged by burying one's head in the sand and pretending that some very real issues do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I wish to correct some misunderstandings about the national residue survey (NRS) which appear to have pervaded the ranks of the Opposition. It has been suggested on several occasions that the national residue survey failed Australian primary producers by not detecting organochlorine residues in beef prior to detections in the United States of America in 1987. This is incorrect and fails to recognise that the NRS is a quality assurance program and not a quality control device. Without analysing every animal or piece of fruit it is not possible to prevent occasional residue violations and product rejection. The NRS has been reviewed by authorities in the United States of America on several occasions and found to be satisfactory. Annual results have routinely been provided to the United States Department of Agriculture. Quarterly reports have also been routinely provided to State authorities and commodity organisations within Australia. The results of organochlorine monitoring via the NRS have been confirmed through some 600,000 analyses since mid-1987. The national residue survey had demonstrated organochlorine violations to be only 0.4 per cent, which is comparable with, if not better than the records of other countries. DDT violations were only 0.02 per cent and none had been detected since 1977. Despite goods results across all product categories covered, the NRS is being upgraded to ensure that the survey remains equivalent to or better than those of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill to honourable senators and indicate the Government's support of the proposed Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia as a further commitment on the part of the Government to practical and sound agrochemicals management in this country. </PARA>

It is regarded by the Government as high priority legislation which will be of critical importance to Australia's primary industry, to the protection of the health of all Australians and ensuring the preservation of the Australian environment. During its passage through the lower House the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) agreed to consider seven amendments proposed by Mr Lloyd. Subsequently it was agreed that the intent of two of the amendments be incorporated into the legislation. The first of these amendments provides for the immediate disclosure of confidential information in the public interest to address a possible or actual emergency. Such situations could arise where recommendations are not followed in instances of accident or when new pivotal information comes to light. The second amendment establishes mechanisms to handle submissions already in train which have been cleared but not yet registered. </PARA>

Some chemicals are cleared and registered in Australia years after they are available to people of other countries. The stated objective of this legislation is to streamline the clearance and registration procedures relating to crop protection and animal health products marketed in Australia. However, there are already substantial delays in the registration of such products. Indeed, it appears likely that this will lengthen with the introduction of this Bill. As I mentioned earlier, the worst bottleneck appears to be the under-resourcing of the Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct a question to the Minister on clause 17. In my debate during the second reading stage I commented on a real situation which has developed on the east coast of Australia relating to some blood samples, and I wish to test this Bill in that regard. I ask the Minister for an interpretation as to whether clause 17 is relevant to the present position. In my speech I mentioned that four medical practitioners had taken 41 blood samples and had sent them to the United States of America, only to find that up to 20 times the expected toxic residues were revealed by those blood samples. I am speaking of a real situation involving a set of blood samples which were sent away a couple of weeks ago. In the last week the same four practitioners have sent an additional 56 blood samples to the United States and are awaiting the outcome of that analysis. As I said in my speech on the second reading, such analysis can only be carried out in the United States as sampling facilities are not available in Australia. Those samples, by American standards at least, have revealed extraordinarily high levels of toxicity. Could the Committee be advised whether under clause 17 practitioners in such a situation would have recourse to call on the Council for reconsideration of the clearance of chemicals presently used in agricultural and veterinary applications?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is the precise rationale for the clause. It enables the Council to reconsider the clearance of a chemical product in the light of new information coming to hand after a certificate of clearance has been granted. The certificate holder is notified of the Council's decision to reconsider and is required to show cause why the certificate should not be withdrawn or qualified by extra conditions. If the Council remains satisfied regarding the product, it may reaffirm the grant of clearance. If the Council is no longer satisfied with the product under the original conditions, it may impose extra conditions of clearance or withdraw clearance of the product. Notification of such changes will be published in the Gazette and forwarded to registering authorities in participating States.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the amendments I successfully moved to the legislation setting up the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority I sought to decrease the prison term in relation to the fine in order to bring the two into consonance. The Government has pointed out that very often prison terms are not served in their entirety. In fact, very often a much lesser term is actually served. Under my amendments the maximum fine would be $5,000 or imprisonment for two years. In both instances I believe the amendments will be acceptable to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments that have been moved by the Australian Democrats clearly show their thinking on this matter. On the last occasion on which we considered this type of legislation similar amendments had been proposed and circulated by the Democrats. They proposed that a $2,000 fine remain but that a prison sentence be reduced to one month. Obviously they thought-and this involved their witch-hunt-that on this occasion if they circulated information their proposal for a minimum penalty of one month's imprisonment would be agreed to. I do not know whether this was set-up deliberately so that spies sent into chemical organisations would get away almost scot-free. Since I discussed these matters in my speech on the second reading, the Democrats have changed their position, probably to curry favour with the Government in order to get support for increased penalties in other amendments down the track. The original penalty imposed was a $2,000 fine, 12 months imprisonment, or both. I consider that all the penalties in the Bill, which we support as a whole, are quite adequate when one compares them to the penalties imposed in other clauses. The Opposition will not support these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply refer Senator Panizza to the debate in which, with the support of the Opposition, I successfully amended the Bill setting up the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. The original thinking in seeking to reduce the prison term was to bring some similarity between the penalties as expressed in dollar terms and as expressed in terms of imprisonment. On that occasion I argued, with very strong support from the Opposition-it is now written into law-that the prison term should be reduced relative to the dollar fine. It was implied by the figures that the poor went to gaol while the rich simply paid a fine and got off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggested at that stage, and it was supported by the Opposition, that for those people on an average income of $20,000 a year a fine of $2,000 would compare roughly with one month in gaol. That is what I sought. The Government was not prepared to support that. I frankly admit that what we now have is a compromise. What we are seeing is a twofold increase in the term of imprisonment and a 2 1/2-fold increase in the fine. What we propose is a fairer and closer relationship between those two sanctions than that contained in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still disappointed because the offence for which these penalties are being written in is precisely the offence that was written into the other legislation that was passed not so long ago in this place in relation to the revelation of information acquired by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. The Democrats have moved amendments which are not in keeping with a piece of legislation that was recently passed but at least they are closer to a real situation than what was contained in the original Bill. For that reason I think the amendments should be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the textiles, clothing and footwear papers in front of me but my recollection is that the Australian Democrats on that occasion took the opportunity to reduce the gaol sentences to terms more appropriate to the monetary fine. What the Australian Democrats are now proposing, in contrast, is to increase the monetary fines to be more appropriate to the gaol sentences. Frankly, I have great difficulty in accepting that that is the correct way to proceed in this legislation.

To some extent the imbalance is being addressed. We are moving in the same direction as occurred with our amendment to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Bill. We have not increased the fine alone; both sanctions have been increased but the fine has been increased by more than the term of imprisonment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments moved by Senator Coulter. In doing so, I refer to the comments of Senator Panizza a few moments ago. I regret his having made those remarks inasmuch as, with relation to clause 20, they take no account of the fact that his Deputy Leader had just informed the Senate that some accommodation had been made with the Government, in the interests of the passage of this legislation, and therefore the Opposition was withdrawing certain amendments and agreeing to other amendments of the Government on this very clause. Yet Senator Panizza suggested that the Australian Democrats might have been involving themselves by way of these amendments, which are a revision of the original amendments-they were revised cheerfully by Senator Coulter, after discussion with the Government-in a process to curry favour with the Government. It is a while since Senator Panizza spoke, but I think that is what he said. In no way are the amendments before us in their revised form to curry favour with the Government, any more, I would suggest, than the accommodations that the Opposition has made with the Government since the passage of this legislation through the House of Representatives on amendments which it proposed there, and which are now incorporated in the Government amendments or have been altered in some way, are to curry favour with the Government. I had assumed that we were all, on this piece of legislation at least, acting in the interests of getting the best legislation we can, as a chamber and as a Parliament, on an issue which is vital to the future interests of this country-not just the agricultural industry, but the health and safety of the whole community, as well as the environment and the widest range of other issues. I deeply regret that what is sauce for the goose is not always sauce for the gander in this chamber, and Senator Coulter's comments about the need to get the best possible amendments should be taken into account at least by Senator Panizza.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I must emphasise, following what Senator Powell has said, that I stand by everything I have said to the Committee. I turn to the question of penalties, and the $5,000 fine or 24 months imprisonment. The original drafting proposal equated roughly $180 with each month in gaol. I think 12 into 2,000 is something like that. With this proposal the figure has risen slightly, to about $200 a month. I consider that those two penalties are out of kilter. When court sentences are given the principle is generally-and we were instructed this as justices of the peace-that people not be fined to gaol, if that is the appropriate term. The gaol term must reflect something like loss of earnings. I know that in Western Australia, at least, there is a certain figure but I do not know whether it is the same all over Australia.

<PARA>Clause 22 gives considerable concern to the industry. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia Ltd (AVCA) has written to Mr Bruce Lloyd, who is the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, in a letter dated 10 May 1988, about the details of this Bill. I will quote from the letter in relation to this matter. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal concern to AVCA is Clause 22 (1). AVCA believes it is unnecessarily severe, potentially open to a wide range of interpretations and would be impractical to implement in its current form in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 (1) (a) requires a person or a company to provide, in writing, information which contradicts any information furnished to the Council or risk a harsh financial penalty or potential imprisonment for up to five years or both. AVCA suggests this is a harsh, unnecessary and totally out of context inclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> This is reinforced under Clause 22 (1) (b) where the potential is for any person or group of persons to suggest (and only a suggestion is necessary-as provided in Clause 17 (1)) that the cleared product has a `unintended harmful effect' or say that it was only 90% effective rather than the 95% effective as shown by field trials for these extreme penalties to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate over either what is an `unintended harmful effect' or a `less effective product' is open to considerable variation of interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> AVCA strongly objects to this Clause in its current format, particularly where we note in Clause 45 that no proceedings can be taken against the Commonwealth or a person involved with the Council relating to the use of a chemical product. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> AVCA suggests that implementation of this Section would be impractical and seeks either deletion or considerable modification of this Clause, consistent with existing requirements relating to product efficacy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is for the reasons set out in that letter that the Opposition has moved the circulated amendment. This amendment is designed to protect the person to whom a clearance has been granted from a situation that could arise if there were any insignificant changes in the information available about a particular chemical-for example, if the efficacy of a product was shown as a result of experimentation or new data to change by even one per cent, the company concerned could be prosecuted and exposed to serious penalty. The insertion of the words `significant' and `significantly', in our view, remedy this defect. </PARA>

Biocides are very toxic materials and, according to clause 22, if a chemical company becomes aware of any change in the information which it has supplied and on which it has received the registration and permission to market a particular chemical, of course that information should be made available. If that information is withheld, then very severe penalties should be exacted against those large companies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are numbers of examples of major chemical companies and major groupings of chemical companies around the world which, in the past, have withheld vital information from the relevant authorities, and the withholding of that information has exposed large numbers of workers and people in the community to extremely toxic hazards. I gave several examples in my speech on the second reading, in relation to DVCP and the registration of a drug. Another example would be the way in which the Manufacturing Chemists Association of the United States, between 1972 and 1974, withheld information on the extreme carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride monomer. Thousands of workers were exposed to very high levels of one of the most potent cancer causing agents. That information was withheld from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. There are numerous examples of this sort of thing having happened in the past and it is vital that not only these sorts of provisions be written in but also that the penalties be very substantial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether I could explain the situation to the Minister. I am sure that he, as a Minister who is just taking over this Bill, is interested to observe the situation. This clause relates to criminal matters. If the Minister were to look at page 18 of the Bill, he would see that under the Bill as it stands at present there is a penalty of $10,000 or imprisonment for five years, or both, for a natural person or, in the case of a body corporate, a penalty of $50,000. Let me alert the Minister to the fact that the Australian Democrats are not satisfied with those penalties. They are not sufficiently harsh, according to the Australian Democrats. The Democrats propose to increase those penalties to a $100,000 fine-not $10,000-on an individual and a fine of half a million dollars, $500,000, on a company. The companies' representative, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia Ltd, which the Democrats, apparently, take exception to, has said, `Hang on; we could be subjected to these penalties for some very insignificant error'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The point I am making is that the accused in this case could be subjected to these penalties for some minor infringement. We are proposing the use of the word `significantly'. Of course that would be a matter for someone's discretion. The discretion would be the jury's. The accused would be charged with an offence and would come up for trial and the jury would have to find whether the accused had `significantly' contradicted information. Or it would have to find, as in my amendment (5) (b), whether:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the use of the chemical product in accordance with the claims or recommendations for its use may have an unintended harmful effect or may be significantly less effective . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A jury would consider whether the use of the product had a harmful effect. Again, that is a subjective decision which the jurymen or jurywomen would have to make. It would not make any real difference to them to make a subjective deduction whether the use of the product were significantly less effective. The amendment gives the jury some idea of what the Parliament intended by this provision. I suggest to the Minister that, if there is some difficulty about this matter, he seek leave to report. We ask the Minister what he thinks about this amendment. It is not unreasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What ought to be made clear to the Senate is that even some of the companies which Senator Coulter spoke of earlier have refused to provide information to Australian regulatory authorities, even though in some cases that information was available to regulatory bodies in other countries such as the United States. Given the reluctance of some companies to provide this sort of information, there seems little alternative but to have some sort of enforcement provisions, some sort of penalty, to ensure that they do so.

<PARA> (4) Page 18, subclause 22 (1), penalty provision, paragraph (b), line 16, leave out ``$50,000'', insert ``$250,000''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments also relate to penalties. My original amendments, which were circulated and subsequently withdrawn, proposed to increase the fine commensurate with the prison term on the basis of one year equalling $20,000. So originally we were proposing a fine of $100,000. I think that might have been the figure Senator Lewis was citing earlier. After discussion with the Government, that figure has been reduced to $50,000, or imprisonment for 10 years. Again, the prison term has been doubled but the fine has been increased by a factor of five. Whilst it is not an ideal situation from the point of view of the Australian Democrats, it is nonetheless moving in the right direction, both in bringing a balance between the fine and the prison term and in making the fine substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate-Senator Lewis does not seem to accept this-that the literature is strewn with examples of chemical companies that have failed to provide the correct information to registering authorities when first seeking registration of a chemical, whether it is an agricultural chemical or a drug. They have failed to notify those authorities when new information has become available. Clause 22, which we are dealing with now, relates to this area. Long after the information was available people have been unnecessarily exposed to risks. As opposed to the amendments which have just been passed in relation to the revelation of information provided to the authorities, here we are dealing with the revelation of information which is vital to the health and welfare of, potentially, hundreds of thousands of people. Substantial increases need to be made to these penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting for a moment on the unsuccessful amendments of Senator Lewis, the provision of substantial penalties will ensure that, if the company is at all in doubt about whether information is relevant, it will provide that information to the authority. That is precisely what should be done. If the information proves to be trivial, so be it. The information is protected by the clauses which have already been agreed to. So the companies and the individuals working in those companies need have no fear about providing too much information. In the past the problem has been that they have provided too little information or have been selective about the information that is available to them and have provided only that information which shows their product in a good light and have suppressed information which shows their product in a bad light or to be not as effective as they are claiming it to be. </PARA>

We now have another attempt at boosting penalties, no doubt brought on by the Democrats as another shot at the chemical companies. If the amendments are carried, the penalties as they now stand, will have two results for the chemical companies, especially the smaller chemical companies. They will put the cost of chemicals beyond the buying capabilities of farmers or, alternatively, they will drive the companies out of the country. If the costs go up or we drive these companies out of the country we will not have those chemicals available. In turn, that will give the Democrats what they want-no chemicals in production. It will cut down Australia's chemical production. While the Democrats may have what they think is chemical-free food, other people will be starving throughout the world. In any case, the food will not be chemical-free: more people were dying of food poisoning, et cetera, 100 years ago than are dying as a result of chemicals now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My exact remarks were that the literature is littered with examples of chemical companies not providing full information to the registering and regulating authorities. In fact, most of those examples apply to American literature but I am sure that I can find examples of the same thing happening in Australia. Dealing with what Senator Panizza has said, I do not know whether he was in the chamber earlier but I will just run past him one very personal example. In 1979 I was involved in a Four Corners program in which I showed on camera the product Baygon. I said that the active ingredient in this product had been shown as long ago as 1973 to be mutagenic and I believed that eventually it would be shown to be a human cancer-causing agent. That caused Bayer Australia Ltd, which is the manufacturer of Baygon, to launch a $10m writ against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, claiming that $10m was its promotional cost for Baygon up to that time. The writ stayed in place for 12 months. It was never tested in court and I believe there was never any intention to test it in court. It was intended to make it sub judice and to allow that product to remain on the market without the Four Corners program being reshown or without others being able to make those sorts of allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are playing in the sort of ballpark where a company can launch a $10m writ simply over its promotional costs for one product.

A quarter of a million dollars is by no means an excessive amount. </PARA>

He placed a great deal of emphasis on the fact that that company went out for $10m which was about what it had spent on promotion up to that date. But so what? I do not believe for one moment that it costs any more for anyone to issue a writ for $10m than it does to issue a writ for $1m or $500,000 or $10,000.

<PARA>The amendments relate to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I find it quite fascinating that the Australian Labor Party mans that Committee and produces these reports, but apparently it is unable to effect any changes through Caucus which, I remind the Committee, we used to do when we were in government. If we were not able to get it through the party room we would come into the chamber and move the amendments. I do not know where the members of the Committee are. The Committee, which is chaired by Senator Cooney, keeps producing excellent reports but they are no good unless they are implemented. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its ninth report of 1988, issued on 1 June 1988, deals with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. The report deals with clause 22 which refers to the reversal of the onus of proof. We are talking about a criminal matter. We are talking about penalties of $250,000 or five years imprisonment. They are really quite horrific penalties. In addition, the clause reverses the onus of proof. The Senate Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> If enacted, clause 22 would provide that certain persons (holders of certificates of clearance issued by the Council) are required to notify the Council of any new information at variance with information previously provided to the Council, or which may indicate that the use of chemicals in accordance with published recommendations may be harmful, or less effective, than originally represented to the Council. Failure to notify the Council may lead to prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 (3) would reverse the onus of proof in a prosecution under the provision. It is a defence to a charge, under the clause, that the person charged did not possess, and had no means of access to, the information referred to in the clause. Although the matters which would constitute the defence are such as would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, it is difficult to see how a rebuttal of these matters would cause undue expense or difficulty to the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause is accordingly drawn to the Senate's attention in that, by reversing the onus of proof in a criminal prosecution it may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter that the Senate has taken to its heart continually, firstly in the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which tells the Government day after day that it will not allow it to reverse the onus of proof in regulations. This sort of provision is exactly the reason why the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was introduced, to draw attention to things such as the reversal of the onus of proof, and to say to governments of all ilk-whether a Labor Party government or a coalition government-`You must not reverse the onus of proof'. The proof of guilt must always rest on the Crown. Certainly, the accused in any case may be given certain defences that it is entitled to raise in circumstances in which it may not raise them otherwise, but in the long run the onus of proof must rest on the Crown. That is what the argument is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which I moved were drawn up by an expert Senate officer to change the legislation so the Crown would still have the onus of proving. In other words by leaving out the words `being information of which the holder might reasonably be expected to have knowledge or to which the holder might reasonably be expected to have access', inserting the words `being information which the holder knows or has access to' and leaving out the third subclause the holder of the information would have the defence available but the final onus of proof would rest on the Crown. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendments. </PARA>

That is why the wording of the clause is there. I still believe that it is in the public interest that companies provide information that they might reasonably be expected to have. Nothing that Senator Lewis has said dissuades me from that view. If Senator Lewis has that view to put those words in clause 22 (2), then it is essential that clause 22 (3) go ahead in its present form because it provides protection for individuals, which is what we seek to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that I have been in the Senate 12 years. In all of those 12 years the Attorney-General's Department has always pulled that statement. This information is confidential to the defendant; he is the one who should produce it. That has been going on for 12 years to my knowledge. It went on under the Fraser Government and it is now going on under the Hawke Government. I am sure that if the Minister talked to his colleague, Senator Collins, he would tell the Minister how frequently the Attorney-General's Department tries to pull the same trick under regulations. Well, it used to until it found out that Senator Collins was going to be just as tough as I was and it has now probably pulled its head back in. But with Ministers of the Crown, the Attorney-General's Department can get away with it because they do not know to stand up to the Attorney-General's Department and say, `That's nonsense; we are not going to have that; it is a reversal of the onus of proof'. The day that a Minister of the Crown has the guts and determination to say that to the Attorney-General's Department, it will buckle and say, `We know the correct form because the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has repeatedly taught us what the correct form is'. The Department will then give you the correct form. It takes Ministers a long time to learn that they have to stand up to the Attorney-General's Department and not let it pull this trick. It is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the Senate is the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill which provides on an annual basis the provision to the States of Commonwealth income tax sharing revenue for their own governmental purposes. The Bill authorises expenditure by the Commonwealth of $12.4 billion to the various States for those purposes. Altogether this represents about 15 per cent of the total of Commonwealth Government expenditures. It is interesting to note that, in the recent Budget announcement of the cuts in government expenditure of some $700m, 70 per cent has come about by virtue of cuts made to the financial grants to the States. Although it is no doubt proper to put pressure on the States to be more accountable for their expenditure-and to do so in such a way as to ensure that taxpayers get benefit for their dollars which are so hard earned and which we paid to the Hawke-Keating Government-the fact is that this represents a degree of hypocrisy when one considers that the Commonwealth Government cuts represent only 30 per cent of the total reductions in expenditures by the Commonwealth. In other words, a very small percentage of the cuts is attributable to this Government's own restrictions on its own operations. It gives the lie to the claims by the Hawke-Keating Government that it is exercising restraint over its own activities. In fact, most of the restraint is being exercised over State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to questions about the basics of the Budget. Obviously that Budget, which was put down in this place only two months ago, is already falling apart. We have seen in the outcomes for the first three months of the financial year a rather worse balance of payments situation than was estimated in the Budget. We now see a figure of around $4 billion of deficit compared with a total estimate for the full 12 months of $9.5 billion. The figure is almost up to the half way mark and only a quarter of the year has gone by. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister talks about Mr Fraser. I would remind him that since 1983 this Government all by itself has quadrupled this country's debt. We now owe $100 billion to the rest of the world. When Mr Fraser went out of office in 1983, the figure was only $30 billion or thereabouts. Now $100 billion has to be repaid. Even Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, has said in this very place that, unless something is done, we are headed down the Argentinean road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to go on at too great length about this because, although there is so much to tell, there are many other stories that I would like to bring out tonight. We must realise first and foremost that the Government is hitting the average family man right, left and centre. This is causing enormous difficulty and, as we have shown in figures put down in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, the average family man, with his spouse at home and not working, with two children, taking into account all social security benefits, compared with the time when Mr Fraser went out of office is in real terms $56 a week worse off today than he was in 1983. Clearly this is a disaster for the average family. The results of the by-elections in Adelaide, Port Adelaide and Oxley clearly demonstrate that the people of Australia have had enough of this Government and are giving very solid messages as to how they want to see this country governed. We know that interest rates are rising and are continuing to rise, and that will have a great impact on the standards of living of the average family. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains an interesting innovation. Last May in the mini-Budget the Government decided to allow local government bodies and State governments to charge Commonwealth authorities the various taxes-payroll taxes, rates on their property and so on-whereas previously that had been prohibited by the Constitution. That would be fine if it were all on the basis of user pays, making Commonwealth bodies properly accountable for their expenditures and running their businesses in the most efficient manner. But what the Government is also doing-and this is causing a great deal of concern, particularly among local government people-is saying, `You can charge Commonwealth bodies those taxes, but we will take back 90 per cent of it by reducing the amount of grants we will give'. Therefore, there is a net gain to the people who are running local government and State governments of only 10 per cent of the total amount they will have to charge. This will put local government to a great deal of trouble in having to value properties and to work out how much they will charge. There will be enormous equity problems in distributing funds among the various local governments, not all of whom have Commonwealth authorities such as Telecom Australia or Australia Post sited in their areas. A very difficult administrative problem will arise. Ordinary ratepayers in local government areas will find it more difficult to gain equity than will the rather larger councils which have access to that kind of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather startled at Question Time today, when Senator Chaney addressed a question to the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, about Rothwells Ltd in Perth, that the Minister had nothing to say except that he really thought everything would be all right as far as Rothwells in Western Australia was concerned and that it was likely that his only interest would be stirred in this matter in the event of there being a collapse of Rothwells and the Government of Western Australia being called upon to contribute money to beef up Rothwells bank. Many senators have followed this matter with a great deal of interest. I see tonight that things have come to a head in that we have now heard that the stock exchange has suspended trading in the shares of Rothwells Ltd. I heard tonight that the Chairman of the National Securities and Exchange Commission (NCSC), Mr Bosch, is calling for audited statements to be presented as quickly as possible so that the true financial situation of Rothwells bank can be assessed in the interests of the shareholders and, presumably, the depositors as well. </PARA>

Honourable senators will recall that immediately following the stock exchange crash of 19 October last year Rothwells in Perth was drawn into considerable difficulty. A bailing out operation was set up by various millionaires in Perth-Mr Holmes a Court and Mr Bond, amongst others-in order to safeguard Rothwells organisation. Those changes, which involved real estate purchases from Rothwells, properties being sold, leasing back, and so on, occurred on 26 October last year. The next day the Government of Western Australia gave a guarantee of $150m of taxpayers' money as an endorsement on a stand-by bill in order to safeguard the funding of Rothwells. At that time the State Superannuation Board in Western Australia appointed a board member to sit on the board of Rothwells. There were certain arrangements about fees which would accrue to the Government. The first question that arises is whether a government should be involved in entrepreneurial activity such as receiving fees for guarantees and so on. Leaving aside that question, the question then arises as to what were the motives of the Government of Western Australia in getting involved in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA> On 30 November the then Premier, Mr Burke, was noted in the press as saying that shire councils and charities would have lost $60m or $70m had Rothwells crashed and that that was a justification for State Government activity. That might be so, but it would be interesting to know why it was that those charities and those State government and shire council bodies put their money in Rothwells in the first place. That question has not been answered, as I understand it. On 23 December last year, a couple of days before Christmas, Mr Connell, the head of Rothwells, got his Christmas present when the NCSC withdrew his securities dealer's licence for Rothwells. Consequently, it has not been able to operate in that condition. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 March this year a company controlled by Mr Connell lent $30,000 to the head of the Western Australian State Superannuation Board, Mr Brush, on the security of an insurance claim in which apparently it had been involved in 1985. A very close connection with Rothwells and the Government of Western Australia was indicated in that regard. On 16 July there then developed a new phase in the operations of Rothwells. We saw the Government, desperately, for electoral purposes, try to remove itself from its guarantee of $150m for Connell to get out of the Rothwells bank. It did this in a rather curious way. The guarantee had to be got rid of and the Government had to remove itself from its possible obligation in the event of Rothwells going bust. Apparently, the Bond Corporation approached the Government and came up with a deal for the establishment of a petrochemical works near Kwinana in Western Australia, just south of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a rather interesting exercise. I will not bore the Senate with all the details, but the essence of it is this: Mr Connell, who was then the head of the Rothwells organisation, would be forced and financed, by both the Bond organisation and the Government, to take over certain debts of Rothwells totalling $350m, in compensation for which he would receive shares in a company called Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. The acronym by which it goes is PICL. One cannot imagine the Western Australian Government being in a worse pickle than it is over this matter. This company, Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd, apparently has relatively little in the way of assets. In fact, if we look at its balance sheet we find that it has no tangible assets; all its assets are described as intangible. By resolution of the board of the company, all the expenditure of the company is built up on the balance sheet as an intangible asset and has absolutely no worth. Needless to say, the company has achieved nothing in terms of getting operational. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of Western Australia has committed $175m to that company so that it will-as it discloses as its objective-set up a petrochemical works in Kwinana. I point out to the Senate that that, together with another $225m from the Bond organisation, is mostly going in two directions. First and foremost, $350m is going to Mr Connell to buy back debts from the Rothwells bank. Of course, he will then have these debts, which are virtually worthless. Another $50m will be paid to the other partner in the company, Mr Dallas Dempster, a businessman from Perth, for his shares in Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd, which obviously have very little value. It will enable him to spend that $50m on his other major investment, the Burswood Casino in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to try to fill this out a little, I turn to the balance sheet of Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. I have here the report of the directors for the year ended 30 June 1988, and I find in the annual report, as filed with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Perth, that the net profit of the company during the year after provision for income tax was nil. Of course no dividends were paid to any shareholders, and the review of operations for the year indicates that the project continued as a result of an acceptable feasibility study concerning some objective in establishing the Kwinana site. I find from the figures in the balance sheet that apart from this no profit situation, total shareholder equity is described as being $500,000. That might be a tremendous amount of money, but if we look down the list we find an item described as property, plant and equipment, to the value of $262,000. Then, the next item is an intangible asset of $21.5m. Of course we then have the corresponding liability, which presumably is borrowings from the State Government and other sources in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have this company with an intangible asset made up, as I say, of accumulated expenditure on what is non-recoverable assets, of something like $21m. Yet the Government of Western Australia has seen fit to invest $175m in this company and it has said, as some sort of justification, `Well, Mr Bond has come along as part of the deal with another $225m'. This is absolutely amazing. It must be one of the greatest financial mirror tricks of all time. How can someone who is supposed to be a very important businessman in this country, Mr Bond, be convinced to put in over $200m, and how can the Western Australian Government be convinced to put in nearly another $200m, for something that is not worth a cracker?</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose there has to be some other story behind all of this. We find various press references to a valuation of this company having been done. Apparently, this valuation was carried out by the First Boston Bank in the United States. It came up with a valuation of something like $400m. We have not seen that valuation. The Government of Western Australia has not disclosed it or made it public in any way, and of course that is the major complaint of all the people involved in this matter. Nobody really knows anything about what is going on with Rothwells because there is no proper accountability of that show. It is hard to comment on the First Boston Bank valuation, but let us try to find out what are the assets of Petrochemical Industries. It has a block of land at Kwinana. Honourable senators will remember that I mentioned that around $260,000 had been invested in land, and presumably that is the land. The second asset is a contract to buy gas from the State Energy Commission of Western Australia. I suppose that is some sort of asset, but we do not know what the price of the gas is going to be. We have no way of assessing what the profitability from the buying of that gas by such a petrochemical company might be. It would be interesting, therefore, to get hold of the Government's valuation from the First Boston Bank to find out what that is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further contract-it is described as a contract-with Mitsubishi to buy the entire plastic feed stock supplied by Petrochemical Industries. I do not know what it is that is being produced, and we do not know whether that is a binding agreement on Mitsubishi or just a few scribbles on a piece of paper. It would be very useful if that kind of information were produced for public viewing so that we could properly assess what is happening with this company. There is a further contract, of course, to build a plant, the cost of which is described as being something like $800m. As far as we know, that money would be coming from the First Boston Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> But we still have the question of why this company is so valuable to Mr Bond and the Western Australian Government that they would put in, collectively, $400m at this point in time when its only assets are the ones I have just described and which do not show on the balance sheet any value whatsoever. Of course, as I have pointed out, the only asset on the balance sheet of any apparent worth is worth nothing. This has to be one of the greatest financial question marks of all times. This Senate should be demanding, as should the Minister for Finance be demanding, that the Western Australian Government provide some accountability concerning this matter because quite obviously taxpayers' money is at risk. We have seen today that trading in Rothwells shares has been suspended on the Stock Exchange. We have seen in the last day Mr Connell, the former Chairman of Rothwells, resign from office. We have seen, on top of the $150m worth of guarantee that I mentioned earlier in the piece that occurred back in October last year, a further $75m injected into Rothwells yesterday. This follows a run on the bank last week. What is more, we have seen a lot of jiggery-pokery with a $10m bill from the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia that apparently could not be met by Rothwells last week and which involved some kind of baling out operation by other parts of Western Australia Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many unanswered questions associated with this matter that most urgent action has to be taken by the Hawke- Keating Government, and in particular by the Minister for Finance. They must demand answers from the Western Australian Government as to what is going on. As Mr Bosch, the Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission, said tonight, there must be an accounting, there must be a proper audit conducted of the affairs of Rothwells so that we can understand exactly what the liability of the people of Western Australia is. If an enormous amount of money is at risk in this complicated set of deals, the Government should be taking action to ensure that State revenue grants to the Government of Western Australia are restricted until it gets its affairs in order. That would appear to me to be appropriate action by the Federal Government-this Government that claims to have so much integrity in the way it conducts its affairs. It is supposed to be full of economic brains and yet it allows a financial shambles of this order to develop under its own nose. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we have a Labor Government here in Canberra holding sway over the Parliament and its sister Government in Western Australia, and we know that the Minister for Finance is a senator elected on the Australian Labor Party ticket in Western Australia. Who better to undertake such an important study and make sure that the Government of Western Australia is made accountable for its actions and for its funding to the people of Western Australia than Senator Walsh, who is the leading and most senior member of the Hawke-Keating Labor Government from Western Australia? This is not just a mere duty that he should perform on behalf of all the people of Australia. He has an obligation to put pressure on his colleagues who run the Government of Western Australia to find out exactly what is going on with Western Australia Inc. and to ensure that they make a proper accounting not only to the people of the State of Western Australia but to the Commonwealth of Australia as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, as Senator Messner may well have said before I came into the chamber, is part of the Government's great cost cutting program; its expenditure cutting program. It is also a buck-passing exercise as far as real expenditure cuts are concerned because in limiting funding to the States it passes on the responsibility for making cuts in the areas of health, housing and education in particular to State governments. It implements the arrangements agreed to at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting in May in relation to the Commonwealth's general purpose payments to the States. If I have time I will go in a little more detail into the shambles that those Premiers Conferences are turning into as far as Commonwealth Grants Commission recommendations are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, the payments made under this States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988, along with general purpose capital assistance provided for under the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill, have a major impact on the spending and borrowing of State governments. That means that they have a major impact on levies, costs and charges passed on to the consumer in areas which are under the jurisdiction of State governments. People are being forced to bear Federal Government costing cuts because the State government is not exercising a great deal of restraint. It cannot afford, in many cases, to exercise restraint in those vulnerable areas of education, housing and health care. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly bad when one considers that the level of assistance provided in the Bill before us tonight in fact involves a reduction of some $650m against the Forward Estimates at the time of the Premiers Conference. That is a statement-an admission if you like-that was made in the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding). He did not seem to be particularly fussed by it, but I think it is a fairly appalling indictment of a government that preaches expenditure restraint and then forces it onto State governments and passes the buck in doing so. On the Government's own figures, general purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are estimated to be down by 4.6 per cent in real terms on top of a reduction of a little more than 5 per cent in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proudly asserts in the Minister's second reading speech that these cuts:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . contributed toward the fiscal restraint exercised by the State and Local Government sector in 1987-88 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and furthermore goes on in that second reading speech to welcome the restraint. One needs to ask, first of all, whether there was a significant amount of restraint by the States; whether they did not simply choose to raise the extra money, as I said a moment ago, by increasing charges around the place. Or, if they did exercise restraint, what cost was there to provision of services in the areas of health, education and housing, and who was affected by that? One can bet one's life that they were not the sorts of people whom Senator Messner was talking about, the ones who can afford to contribute $200m to get a mate out of trouble. Those people were not affected by any State restraint, if it was exercised, nor were they likely to be particularly affected by increased charges imposed by State governments to make up the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself has argued that it is important that all levels of government restrain their spending and borrowing in order to restrain domestic demand, reduce the call on domestic savings and arrest the build-up in foreign debt. When will the Government do something about the 50 per cent or more of the foreign debt which is run up by the private sector? It is no good simply hitting the States and hoping they will not borrow. This Government continues to encourage foreign borrowings by the private sector by continuing to permit tax concessions, such as negative gearing, regardless of whether the money is borrowed for expansion from the domestic market or from the foreign market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's attitude to this restraint-and I use the word loosely-by the Federal Government is quite interesting. If we have a look at the speech made by Mr Peacock in another place last month, we find him saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not criticising the Government for the reductions in payments to the States. I am criticising the Government, however, for the hypocrisy it has shown in demanding spending restraint from all other levels of government while at the same time not matching the bid it asks the States to accept. I shall therefore be moving an amendment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Part of that amendment-and I presume we will see it in this chamber-says:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) this Government has been found wanting in the need to bear its share of expenditure restraint by cutting its own direct expenditure, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have got news for Mr Peacock. In case he has not noticed, this Government has drastically cut expenditure in some areas and it has done it with the enthusiastic cooperation of every Opposition senator in this place. The Government has cut expenditure in health care provision, in public housing provision, in education and particularly in social welfare. It has done it both directly through legislation in this place and indirectly by cutting funding to the States. As I said, it got the support it needed to get the direct cuts through-that is, the cuts that were legislated in this Parliament-not from the Australian Democrats, but from the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia together. </PARA>
<PARA> If people want to check the Hansard records, they will find the information there. They will see that the Government delayed pension consumer price index increases just before Christmas in 1986 with the support of the Opposition. The Government cut ex-Service pension increases with the support of Opposition senators. The Government cut Austudy payments to 15-year-old students from low income families in their last two years of school, with the support of the Opposition. At the same time, it cut unemployment benefits for 16- and 17-year olds. The Government took action against-of all people-45-year-old widows. It put legislation before this chamber, which was supported by the Liberal and National Party senators in this place, that insisted that once a woman who was on widow's class B pension turned 45 and her youngest child turned 16, she was to come off the class B widow's pension and go onto unemployment benefits or look for a job. Imagine what that did for the self-esteem of many of those women, because the jobs are simply not out there. The same businessmen-and I use the word advisedly-who are pressing this Government to cut back on social welfare expenditure are the very ones who will not take on a 45-year-old woman who has been out of the work force raising a family for 20 or so years, because they give no credit to the managerial and personnel skills, much less the budgeting skills, that a woman in that position has developed. Mr Peacock needs to look at the Senate Hansard and find out not only what action the Government has taken but also who helped the Government get that legislation through. In fact, Mr Peacock goes on to say that, in the Government's moves:</PARA>
<PARA> They forget about Australians and they forget about those struggling. </PARA>
<PARA>`They' meaning the Government. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>They just look after themselves and look after their mates. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, as I mentioned earlier, the Government has not done much to stop the borrowing practices and the tax write-offs of some of the biggest companies in the country, which are allowing these people to pay zero cents in the dollar in tax each year. If Mr Peacock does not think that ordinary Australians and others who are struggling have suffered, he had better look at the Hansard records of what has gone through in this place. He might also like to consult a few reports that have come down about the social and economic inequities that exist in this country. I will make it easy for him and give him some examples. The number of Australians living below the poverty line has more than doubled since the mid-1970s. It now exceeds two million, of whom a great number are children. The number of people unemployed for more than a year has increased seven times since the mid-1970s. The number of people waiting for public housing has more than doubled-this, despite the fact that the Government allowed a return of a negative gearing capacity for private investment in rental property on the somewhat laughable assertion that it would encourage wealthy investors to provide rental housing for those in poverty. Over the same period, however, Australia's gross domestic product has increased per capita by about 15 per cent in real terms. In other words, although Australia has become a much richer country, the number of people living in poverty has risen considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> There are people who would argue that this has fallen most heavily on middle Australia. It certainly has impacted dramatically on that sector. But low income people have not, as it has sometimes been asserted, been protected from the decline in living standards which middle Australia has experienced over the last few years. The May economic statement indicated that there are a great number of sole parents and young unemployed people, for example, whose disposable income has been reduced by as much as 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, personal wealth in this country has exploded during the past two years at a rate and to levels practically unknown previously. Certainly, until October of last year share speculation was mostly responsible. But since then the major avenue for rapid increases in wealth has been in the property market. There are now between 40,000 and 50,000 millionaires in Australia. The top one per cent of adult Australians hold about a quarter of all private wealth. The top 10 per cent of adult Australians hold more than 60 per cent of the wealth of this country. Mr Peacock, in a speech to the House on 13 October this year, made a passing reference to a comment by Senator Walsh that we are on the road to Argentina. I would suggest that, if this were a South American country, that disparity in the distribution of wealth would be producing a revolution somewhere. The difficulty is that very few people know about the inequities in the distribution of wealth. As I said, the top 10 per cent of adult Australians hold more than 60 per cent of the wealth of this country, while two million people, including 600,000 children, live below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> These inequalities in access to disposable income show up in things like decreased access to housing for middle and low income earners. Middle income earners are finding it increasingly difficult to own their own homes because of the rising costs of land and housing and of money. Low income earners simply cannot get access to housing at all. We have, too, a highly inequitable taxation system which favours companies against pay as you earn taxpayers. The Government's 1985 tax reform package favoured high income earners, whose marginal tax rates were slashed from 60c to 49c in the dollar, but did not provide similar sorts of benefits to average and low income earners. They got very little tax relief from that year's tax reform package. The tax rate for companies this year was reduced in the Federal Budget from 49c to 39c in the dollar-on the same day that Alan Bond's company posted a record profit of $354m on which it was announced that it had calculated a tax liability of $4m, a little over 1c in the dollar. It turned out that Alan Bond had over-estimated. An article in the Australian Financial Review last week indicated that he is going to pay no tax at all. There are not too many pensioners in this country who are earning a little extra income who can get away with paying no cents in the dollar on their earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at falling real wages for low and middle income earners at the same time as top executives are increasing their income in leaps and bounds. It is not always easy to find out what senior company executives are getting but if one looks at the banking sector, a sector that is constantly claiming that it must push up interest rates and increase its charges on services provided to its depositors, we discover that very little restraint has been exercised at the top end. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report of Westpac Banking Corporation, released in January of this year, showed that four of its chief executives earned more than $1.5m in salary packages in 1987, another eight more than $500,000 and 97 senior staff more than $90,000. Westpac says, `It is not fair of you to quote the fact that four of our executives earned $1.5m'-or were paid $1.5m; that is probably a better way of expressing it-`in 1987. Those people are our Westpac people in Japan and America. We have to buy them houses and cars and give them decent wage packages. When you convert that to Australian dollars, because of the exchange rate you get $1.5m. We know it sounds a lot, but it is not, really'. That argument does not wash with me and I hope that it does not wash with too many other people. What Westpac is saying is, `We are putting increased charges on servicing accounts and demanding that interest rates go up so that ordinary Australians can subsidise the high salaries of executives in the United States and Japan'. </PARA>
<PARA> Low income earners and social security recipients are the fall guys of this Government's alleged expenditure restraint package. They are facing the problems of falling incomes, higher housing costs, the unavailability of public housing and rising prices for basic food and clothing and are watching salaries, services and benefits blow out at the other end of the market. Whilst some people are employed on massive salaries, others-some 600,000 of them-are on unemployment benefits and almost 60 per cent of them have been unemployed for six months or more. A decade ago long term unemployment was restricted to 20 per cent-not 60 per cent-of the unemployed. So much for the Government's equity program. So much for the Government's much vaunted restraint, a restraint which is supposed to be keeping down the foreign debt by cutting the disposable income of middle and low income earners, but which is doing nothing to limit the contribution to the foreign debt that is made by companies which are paying less than a cent in the dollar in tax. There are other ways of balancing budgets than by simply slicing money and services to low income earners. We could do a little to raise a little more from those who can afford it, and that means some of the biggest companies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other major problems that is facing this Government and State governments with regard to expenditure cuts has been incorporated in this piece of legislation, I think for the first time. The States Grants (General Revenue) Bill applies for a single year rather than a triennium. One wonders exactly how much planning State governments can do on annual funding when they are used to triennial funding. Indeed, one wonders, even if they had not been used to it, how they would cope with cuts of this magnitude when they had applied for a single year and there was a promise of more to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister concluded his second reading speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill forms an important part of the Commonwealth's endeavours to continue public sector restraint at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned earlier, this was supported by the Opposition. There is no word here about private sector restraint; there is no word here about increasing revenue from sources that are available to the Government; and there is no word here about proposals by the Government in the near future to make some impact on loss of revenue caused by tax concessions, which are not doing what they were originally intended to do, which are not increasing productivity, which are not increasing employment, but which instead are increasing our foreign debt and drastically reducing the amount of revenue the Government can glean from alleged taxpayers in order to support those who are badly off. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a little while ago that I wanted to make some comments about the way in which the Government goes into the general revenue grants program. I think it is worth while looking at the history of this. Since the early 1980s the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been given the task of assessing appropriate per capita revenue-sharing relativities to apply to the distribution of general revenue grants among the six States. It has done this allegedly to ensure that a fair distribution reflecting the principle of fiscal equalisation-I use the Government's own term-is applied to the States. As far as we know, to date the Commonwealth Grants Commission has carried out its relativities review on a three-year basis and has done it relatively efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has increasingly been the case under both this Government and the previous Government that, where the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission have been wholly or substantially adopted, certain phasing-in adjustments have been included and implemented at the Premiers Conference in order to cushion the move to new relativities by some of the losing States. So we get this transfer through the phasing-in process from the so-called winning States to the losing States. Even though the Commission's recommendations have been formally adopted, given the cut in the level of general revenue funding, some States have had to be given special revenue assistance under the terms of the guarantee by the Government that no State would have a fall in its nominal funding. What is more, as I have said, the funds used to meet this guarantee have been transferred from the so-called winning States and, as has happened in the past, the effect of this guarantee has been to alter effectively the recommendations of the Commission, which makes one wonder why we have the Commission going through this futile exercise, assessing relativities, looking at equalisation and coming up with recommendations that will then have the thimble and pea trick applied to them as money is transferred from the so-called winners to the so-called losers. What, one wonders, is the point?</PARA>
<PARA> This is made even more ludicrous when we consider the matter I raised earlier; that is, that no arrangements have been determined as of this year for next year or the following year. So the triennial mode has been turned into an annual system making it increasingly difficult for the States to undertake forward planning. I think this is a problem when one considers how the States are dealing with the cuts. This is the third consecutive year in which real cuts have been applied to the assistance the Federal Government provides to the States, and we are seeing State governments increasingly responding by cutting capital expenditure. Now that is fine in the short term, but what sort of problems will occur if they continue to cope with this new system by cutting capital expenditure? We will see a massive problem arising, I suspect in the shorter future rather than the longer future, as far as the adequacy of the provision and maintenance of Australia's public infrastructure is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we looking at a time when our universities, our public hospitals and our state schools will fall into disrepair because State governments have slashed capital expenditure in an attempt to make do with the diminishing amount of money that the Federal Government is giving them by way of general grants? I think this concern is magnified by the fact that the Government is also slashing general purpose and hospital payments to the States by 4.9 per cent this year on top of a 4.8 per cent cut in 1987-88 and a further previous cut of 1.1 per cent. One wonders just how State governments will manage without totally privatising the public hospital sector, the public school sector and the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, suggestions are now being made in some States, including my own, that State governments should move out of the area of providing public housing and hand it all over to the private sector, and whatever subsidies are provided to the State governments are handed to the private sector. Certainly the State Government in South Australia is doing an excellent de facto job of privatising the state school system. As a response to the limited amount of funding now being handed over to it by the Federal Government, it has cut expenditure on the provision of services to state schools, and to most parents it is not worthwhile sending their children to a state school. No matter how good the teaching may be, no matter how well intentioned the staff may be, the school's resources are so limited that they simply cannot adequately cope with the needs of the students, much less the demands of the students. </PARA>
<PARA> This Federal Government, through these reduced grants, is effectively forcing State governments to privatise those areas where currently the public sector is providing some sort of competition for the private sector. It is doing so, with the full cooperation of Liberal and National party senators in this place, at the same time as it is further cutting benefits to low income earners as individuals and to low income earning families. I say to Labor Party senators that, if they bother to look at themselves in the mirror, they must wonder why they have not got `C' for Conservative branded on their foreheads. They are implementing the sort of legislation that a future conservative government would dearly love to implement but could not get past a Labor opposition, as the Fraser Government could not get some of these proposals through the Labor Opposition in 1981-82. When Labor is in opposition it has some concern for its traditional supporters. When it is in government it does what Mr Peacock alleged on 13 October in another place that it did. It looks after its mates and forgets middle and low income Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bill before the Senate tonight is largely based on the May Premiers Conference which will once again see my own State of Tasmania facing further funding cuts. Despite promises by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in July of last year that there would be no further cuts to Tasmania my State has lost nearly $30m from its revenue grant, which is equal to a real cut of 5.2 per cent over the past 12 months. While this Federal Government has increased its overseas borrowing limit, the State governments are not permitted to make any overseas borrowings. The Federal Government has more than doubled its global limit on borrowings while reducing the States' limit by 11.2 per cent. The Federal Government has increased the limit on borrowings for its own authorities by $1,452m. This is almost entirely due to a special component of $1,450m for the aviation sector. Although I do not doubt that additional borrowings were needed to meet major fleet re-equipment and expansion requirements for Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines and related airport infrastructure, it seems that this is at the expense of hospitals and schools. Of course, the aviation industry makes a substantial contribution to the economy in Australia, but this example-where one of the Commonwealth's authorities gains precedence over the provision of essential public services-is testimony, I believe, to the benefits of privatisation of such bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of my State of Tasmania, Mr Gray, had been promised by the Prime Minister that funding would not be cut to the State and naturally plans were made by the State Government on the basis of continued funding. To face funding cuts in the light of plans having been set places a significant burden on any State government. I commend Robin Gray on his September budget which contained no tax increases for individual Tasmanians and substantial payroll tax cuts for small and medium sized businesses. The economic reality is that no State in Australia has more going for it than Tasmania. It has a wealth of resources in its people, agriculture, industry and natural resources. However, we are a sparsely populated State, facing diseconomies of scale in the provision of essential services. The State's financial realities are shaped largely by the level of funding received from the Federal Government. In 1981-82, 91 per cent of the State's receipts for works and services came from Canberra. This year the equivalent figure is 32 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh is quite right. It is a shame. He will have to take much of the responsibility for that tremendous decrease. Taking recurrent and capital receipts together, total Commonwealth payments have fallen from 63 per cent of State consolidated fund receipts to 48 per cent. The Commonwealth has also reduced its own capital works expenditure in Tasmania. As a result of the Federal Budget, the State will receive only 0.7 per cent of the entire Commonwealth capital works program budget for 1988-89 even though when he signed away $277m in 1984 for the Franklin Dam compensation, Prime Minister Hawke agreed not to make corresponding reductions in payments to Tasmania, but again the State appears to be suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems ironical that as a quirk of our fiscal arrangements it is the States that provide the majority of services to Australians, such as schools and hospitals, police forces to ensure law and order, the maintenance of roads and ports and the provision of welfare services, yet despite the magnitude of these services the States are starved of the funds required to fulfil their obligations. While the States face continued demands for services from the public, the Federal Government is imposing financial constraints on State governments which forces them to make cuts in spending in some areas. For example, if Federal funding to Tasmania had been maintained in real terms since 1984-85, an additional $440m would have been available this year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When one considers the size of Tasmania and its economy one will realise that a loss of $440m-as revealed in that table-makes a considerable difference to the level of services provided by the Government and the State's economy in general. This money would have meant approximately $1,000 extra for every man, woman and child in the State. Another way of looking at this amount of money and its impact on the Tasmanian economy is to realise that in theory approximately $1m produces something like 40 jobs. Therefore, this amount of money would have been sufficient to provide jobs for just about all of the 17,000 unemployed persons in Tasmania. The cut to Tasmania in recurrent funding of $150m has meant that the State Government has had to increase taxes to raise an additional $70m. This leaves a shortfall of approximately $80m which the State has had to absorb. This has been achieved to some extent by the Government's policy to reduce the Tasmanian Public Service. Since gaining power in 1982, the Government has succeeded in reducing the work force of the State service by 7 per cent. Nevertheless, the impact of the reduced funding has been felt throughout the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the Tasmanian Government's attempts to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on the economic development of other States of the nation, it is continually thwarted by increasing interference by the Federal Government. Control is becoming centralised in Australia as the Federal Government continues its surreptitious gathering of power. In nearly every conceivable area of policy making, State governments face constraints imposed by the Federal Government, either by financial or legal limitations. The irony of the situation is that it is not the Federal politicians who have gained the benefit of the aggregation of powers; the Commonwealth senior public servants are the ones who have managed to create their own kingdoms and develop their own power bases. The resounding decision by the people of Australia earlier this year at the referendum stands as testimony to the fact that the public is satisfied with the Constitution and its arrangements. It is improper for the Federal Government to continue to usurp the mandate of the public by encroaching power from the States, particularly by imposing fiscal or financial constraints on the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Another hypocrisy of the present Federal Budget and States grants is that the Federal Government has insisted that the States curb their spending and exercise constraint while the Federal Government increases its own limit on borrowing. All of the States were cajoled into accepting a freeze in their grants and to show constraint. If the Federal Government had been able to exercise the restraint as it is advocating the States should do, the Federal Budget surplus may have been closer to $12m not $5m. Considering the burden of the provision of services in the Commonwealth it appears inequitable that the States should be asked to show constraint without the Federal Government doing so at the same rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Public Service employs large numbers of people in areas that duplicate State service areas. When it is the State which provides the service it seems ironical that it is asked to provide services with less funding with the inevitability of reduced or lower quality services. Besides the more obvious reduction of financial support from the Federal Government there has also been a reduction in Commonwealth funds provided in terms of services to our State. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the following Commonwealth departments and bodies have been closed recently in Tasmania: the Promotion Australia Office; the regional office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Australian Federal Police office in Launceston; the Telecom Australia office at Burnie with a loss of 42 jobs; and the office of the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. The office dealing with the diesel fuel rebate payments has been transferred from Hobart to South Australia. There has been a transfer of the office looking after the payments of pharmaceutical benefits from Hobart to Victoria. In the latter case that has resulted in increased delays of payments to pharmaceutical chemists in my State, contrary to the arrangements which had been promised by the Federal Government. It is proposed to cut back on work in the Ant- arctic Division. Already the Government has removed the fire service at Wynyard and threatened removal from Launceston and Hobart airports. It announced that on 9 August 1988 the Department of Social Security office would be reduced with a loss of 60 to 70 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the State Grants (General Revenue) Bill required some extra attention in its drafting to eliminate some of its problems. Allow me to highlight a couple of the more glaring definitional problems associated with this Bill. Excuse me if I go through some of the definitions because I think this will highlight some of the problems I wish to raise. The Bill's definition of `borrowing' has the same meaning as in the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Act 1987. In the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Act 1987 section 3 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>In this Act:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Body'' has the same meaning as in the Levy Act;</PARA>
<PARA> ``Borrowing'' includes the raising of money by dealing in securities;</PARA>
<PARA> ``Levy Act'' means the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 3 (1) states that a body means a body referred to in the schedule. Here is the rub. This schedule sets out a list of bodies to which the Act pertains. These include: Aussat Pty Ltd; the Australian National Airlines Commission; the Australian National Railways Commission; the Australian Postal Commission; the Australian Trade Commission; the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission; the Health Insurance Commission; Overseas Telecommunications Commission Australia; and Qantas Airways Ltd. It is important to take this all into consideration because it provides the basis for the current Bill under consideration. The significant factor is that all of these bodies are Commonwealth or national institutions. The States Grants (General Revenue) Bill under consideration is concerned with Commonwealth bodies which includes this list in the schedule. The borrowing definition does not cover borrowing from States and, consequently in this light, Tasmanian global borrowing allocations would become meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 (1) (a) of the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill is of major concern to all Tasmanians and other Australians as it effects the level of borrowings any State may undertake. Clause 7 (1) states that:</PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance to which a State is entitled under this Act in relation to the grant year is granted on the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the State will not allow the sum of its new borrowings and the new borrowings of the State's instrumentalities to exceed the global borrowing limit for the State . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill interprets `new borrowing' as being:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an amount of a borrowing that is received in the grant year but does not include an amount of a borrowing for the purpose of refinancing debt outstanding on 30 June 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> An implication of this is that it does not preclude the loan component of general purpose capital assistance from being classified as new borrowings. Therefore, the global borrowing limit will be made up of both general purpose capital assistance Loan Council borrowings and global borrowings. This has not previously been the situation. The effect of the proposed interpretation is that the level of actual global borrowings will be reduced. For example, in the case of Tasmania the global borrowing limit is $171m. The State's ability to borrow has already been reduced by $10.6m, at 11.2 per cent cut, from last year and as a State we cannot afford to lose any more borrowing power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the Loan Council borrowings component of the general purpose capital funds for 1988-89 will be $27.7m. If the Bill is interpreted so as to classify the loan component of the general purpose capital assistance as new borrowings, it will have the effect of reducing the real global borrowing limit to $143.3m. In order to ensure that the full global borrowing limit is maintained the interpretation of the Bill needs to to be altered so that general purpose capital assistance is excluded from global borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Another unclear interpretation concerns the definition of State instrumentality. The Bill proposes that a State instrumentality includes:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a body corporate that is an instrumentality of the State;</PARA>
<PARA>This raises the important question as to whether this definition includes State banks and financial institutions of the State. If these institutions are included, this Bill effectively subverts the intentions of the Loan Council. Keeping in mind the reservations about the shift in the delicate Federal balance between Canberra and the States, the coalition does not oppose the Bill. But, it is certainly concerned about the impact that these definitional changes will have on the particular States and for that reason the Opposition has moved that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this evening a very important piece of legislation, that is, the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988. This Bill provides for something like 15 per cent of the total outlays from the Commonwealth Budget; so it is not a small matter. It is notable and indeed, I think, the Opposition second reading amendment, certainly implicitly if not explicitly, points out that in this area the Commonwealth Government has this year imposed a significant cut in real terms in the funding available to the States. It is a cut which, if I may say so, is rather out of proportion with what the Commonwealth has failed to do in relation to its own spending programs. There has been a cut of 4.6 per cent in real terms in general purpose payments to the States imposed this year, that is in the general revenue assistance provided by this Bill plus the general purpose capital payments which are made available through the Commonwealth Budget or through the global borrowings limits. However, the Bill does more than that, and I want to focus my remarks tonight on some particular aspects of the legislation which are highly detrimental to my own State of Queensland. I make no apology for doing that. I would do the same if there were as discriminatory an approach being imposed on any other State, but as it happens my own State is involved in this particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is brought out in the general outline section of the explanatory memorandum tabled with the Bill, and I will read the apposite paragraph from the second page of that document. I notice that it is actually numbered page one although it is the second page. Here the Treasurer has set out the main differences between this Bill and its predecessor, the comparable Act, the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1985. The passage in question reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Following failure to achieve unanimous agreement to the borrowing limits proposed by the Commonwealth-</PARA>
<PARA>note those words, `proposed by the Commonwealth'-</PARA>
<PARA>under the Global Approach at the May 1988 meeting of the Australian Loan Council, provision is to be made allowing the Commonwealth to reduce its payment of financial assistance grants to a State if new borrowings by that State in 1988-89 exceed the limit proposed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will remember that in May of this year, at the Loan Council and Premiers Conference meetings in Canberra, the Commonwealth imposed a major cutback in the global borrowing limits of the States as well as, I should add, in the general revenue grants to be paid to the States in 1988-89. In the case of the global borrowing limits, normally agreed in past years between the States and the Commonwealth, there was a reduction of no less than $700.8m in the global borrowing limits of the six States, compared with the nominal dollar figures for the previous financial year, 1987-88. To that total reduction of $700m for the six States, Queensland was asked to contribute an amount of $367.7m-more than half the total. To put the matter in a different way, the cut imposed on Queensland's global limit for 1988-89 compared with the previous financial year is 31.7 per cent. The cut imposed on the other five States taken collectively was 7.7 per cent-approximately one-quarter of the percentage reduction in the case of Queensland. Although I do not make an undue point of the matter, it is notable that at the same time the Commonwealth's own global borrowing limit-partly for the reasons mentioned by Senator Watson-was tripled; it rose by 207 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a brief table which sets out the figures which I have been quoting. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson quite properly interpolates, we have here a situation where the Commonwealth is significantly reducing the global borrowing limits for all the States, and particularly, as I pointed out, in a totally discriminatory manner-there can be no argument about this-for Queensland, while at the same time tripling its own borrowing limit. It is notable, however, that clause 7 subclause (1) of the Bill, to which I just referred, is not framed in terms of Queensland alone. It is in fact framed-as of course it needs to be, for constitutional reasons I think-in terms of all States or any State; so that all States are under this particular legislative harrow which the Treasurer has introduced in this Bill. Some may say that that in itself does not matter too much because in the case of those other five States the amounts by which their borrowing limits have been reduced average-and I shall not weary the Senate by going through them State by State-only a reduction of 7.7 per cent and in the times we live in perhaps that can be borne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are really talking, in practice if not in theory, about Queensland, which, of course, has had its borrowing limit reduced by 31.7 per cent, and that is in money terms. The figure, of course, is greater than that in real terms if one allows for a degree of inflation between the two years. It is to be noted, as I understand it, that this legislation including this particular draconian clause has been introduced by the Treasurer into the House of Representatives without any prior consultation with any State government; certainly not with the Government of Queensland, the State most likely to be affected by this provision, but in any case not with other State governments either so far as I am aware. I also understand that a number of States, including but not only Queensland, have expressed concern about the provision itself and in particular the sheer lack of courtesy involved on the part of the Treasurer and his Department in proceeding in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA> To look back a little, borrowings of the kind which this particular clause relates to used to be made-I suppose technically in some sense they still are made-under the Gentlemen's Agreement, or have been since 1936 at least, and it is certainly true that unlike borrowings under the Financial Agreement, borrowings under the Gentlemen's Agreement did not carry any mandatory provisions so far as the States were concerned. That is to say, agreements were made between the Commonwealth and the States but it was technically at least open to the States to breach those agreements, and indeed there have been past occasions when they did. The question, therefore, has always been whether, so to speak, in order to exert a degree of centralised control upon the borrowings of State governments or their instrumentalities in that manner, the Commonwealth would in fact resort to what used to be called the big stick in these matters and would threaten, and be prepared to carry out the threat, those errant States who did behave in that manner with a punishment in one form or another, usually by way of reduction of the financial assistance grants or whatever those grants have been called at various times over the years. They are now called the general revenue grants. That is exactly what we now have in clause 7 of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come to the clause in question now. It is headed `State observance of global borrowing limit'. This is in a Bill which is ostensibly directed to the subject of `An Act to provide for grants to the States and the NT' and which in its short title is known as the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill. Clause 7, however, does not deal with that matter at all, at least not directly. It simply lays down a condition, as the title of the clause-`State observance of global borrowing limit'-implies. Subsection (1) says:</PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance to which a State is entitled under this Act in relation to the grant year is granted on the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the State will not allow the sum of the its new borrowings and the new borrowings of the State's instrumentalities to exceed the global borrowing limit for the State, being the amount specified in column 2 of the following Table opposite to the State. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if, in the opinion of the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA>I shall come back to those words-</PARA>
<PARA>the global borrowing limit for the State has been exceeded, the Treasurer may reduce payment to the State under this Act by an amount equal to, or less than, the amount that the Treasurer determines to be the amount of the excess.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from the wording of that clause that in what used to be called when introduced in 1984 the voluntary arrangements, described as the so-called global borrowing limits program, the word `voluntary' is no longer appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a quite naked element of compulsion entailed in these arrangements and contained in clause 7 of the Bill and, moreover, one which provides the Treasurer of the day with absolute discretion. As I indicated earlier, clause 7 (1) (b) simply states that if, in the opinion of the Treasurer, the global borrowing limit for the State has been exceeded, the Treasurer may do certain things to penalise the State by way of reducing the general revenue grants otherwise payable to it. It is very interesting, as my colleague Senator Watson said towards the end of his remarks, that some questions arise out of the phrasing of that paragraph. I hope that the Minister will address himself to these matters when he responds. There may be answers to the points I am about to make and which Senator Watson also briefly made. If so, I hope that the Minister will provide them. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to note is that paragraph (a) of the clause says that the State `will not allow the sum of its new borrowings'-that is the State's new borrowings-`and the new borrowings of the State's instrumentalities . . .'. Under the Financial Agreement, the only way a State can actually make borrowings on its own account, other than temporary borrowings, is through borrowings which it has allocated to it by the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth borrows on account of the States. The States no longer borrow on their account. The Commonwealth makes all borrowings on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States and, having done so, allocates proportions of those borrowings in the books of the Commonwealth to each State and then the national debt sinking fund provisions begin to apply and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Technically the clause says that its new borrowings-that is, the State's new borrowings-will be included for the purposes of this legislation in the global limits laid down by the Loan Council. That is another way of saying that what used to be called the works and housing or governmental borrowing program, which is actually borrowed by the Commonwealth and then allocated to the States, will be included in these limits. This may be incorrect, and I notice that in the definitions clause, clause 3 of the Bill, one sees:</PARA>
<PARA>``borrowing'' has the same meaning as in the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Collection Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had time to consult that piece of legislation, and it may be that is the answer to the problem. If it is, I hope that the Minister will enlighten us accordingly; otherwise, there would seem to be a drafting problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the clause goes on to refer to `new borrowings of the State's instrumentalities'. State instrumentalities are defined also in clause 3 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>``State instrumentality'' includes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a semi-governmental or local authority of the State . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite straightforward because borrowings by such bodies are certainly included in the global limits of the new arrangements. The second part of the definition reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a body corporate that is an instrumentality of the State; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a trust of which the State is a trustee or a beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA>I leave aside that last element as being, on its face at least, a wide catch-all category. But, concentrating on paragraph (b) of the definition, one sees:</PARA>
<PARA>a body corporate that is an instrumentality of the State. </PARA>
<PARA>To me that would appear to cover such bodies as State banks, State government insurance offices, and so on, as well as more normal bodies such as electricity commissions which might otherwise be called semi-governmental bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis it would seem that borrowings by any bodies of that type are included for the purposes of clause 7 (1) (a). But, so far as I am aware, borrowings by those bodies are not included in the resolutions of the Loan Council which govern the global borrowing limits. The global borrowing limits are laid down and agreed at the Loan Council meeting by way of resolution between the Commonwealth and the States. Indeed, the reason why we have this piece of legislation before us tonight is that, at the meeting in May, the Premier of Queensland refused to commit himself to the particular resolution in question. On the face of it, it appears-although again I shall wait to hear the Minister's response-that this clause is a major extension of the coverage of the term `borrowings' going well beyond the term `borrowings' as agreed in the resolution governing the global borrowing limits as agreed-at least between five Premiers and the Commonwealth-last May. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of Queensland does not have a State bank, and I think that is the only State government that does not. If the State Bank of Victoria, which I imagine would be covered by the definition of a body corporate, that is an instrumentality of the State, were in need of capital-and banks these days, even State banks, are perennially in need of capital-if it were to make, let us say, a subordinate debt issue in the capital markets, that to my mind-and again I speak subject to the Minister's response-would appear to be a borrowing for the purpose of this legislation; although I repeat that it is not or has never previously been understood to be a borrowing for the purpose of the global borrowing limits resolution agreed to at the Loan Council meeting. Again, if a State Government Insurance Corporation-I shall refrain from following the line of discussion entered on earlier this evening by Senator Messner who was dealing with, among other things, one State government insurance corporation and its activities over recent months-were to make borrowings, including borrowings from banks, let alone borrowings from the market, for the purpose of conducting its activities, those borrowings also, as I read the Bill, would appear to be borrowings for the purpose of clause 7 (1) (a) of the Bill and would or could bring into play the powers that are exercisable by the Treasurer under paragraph (b) of clause 7. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying something about the quite blatant discrimination against the Government of Queensland by the Commonwealth Government which this whole episode reveals. As someone who has attended many Loan Council meetings over a very long time, I have never seen an action of this kind taken by the Commonwealth on such an outright and blatantly discriminatory basis. What were the reasons given for the Commonwealth's attack on Queensland last May, apart from the reasons not given-that is, the purely political reasons? Two reasons were given. The first was that Queensland was said to have an above average per capita borrowing requirement and this was in some sense judged to be unfair and therefore requiring a reduction in its borrowings in order to bring it back closer to the average. I will deal with that point in a moment. Secondly, it was said that Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures indicated that Queensland had a lower net financing requirement than any other State. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the first of those arguments, that Queensland had an above average per capita borrowing requirement, it has to be said, obviously, that Queensland was not the only State in that situation, almost by definition. Nevertheless, I am sure the Queensland authorities would agree that borrowing limits, if they are to apply, should do so on the basis of capital expenditure requirements. I think they would go on to argue that capital expenditure requirements are much more related to population growth, which is the factor governing the need for new investment in a State, than to overall population. As is a matter of record, Queensland is the fastest growing State in Australia in population terms, so it is hardly surprising that Queensland should have an above average per capita borrowing requirement. In contrast to the continual repetitions and dull statements to the contrary in this place by the Minister for Finance when in full flight at Question Time, on the basis of a con- venient Dorothy Dix question to him, Queensland is the fastest growing State in the Commonwealth. This Government has penalised it for that success. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason given at that time by the Commonwealth for its discriminatory treatment of the State was, as I said earlier, that ABS figures indicated that Queensland had a lower net financing requirement than any other State. Let us think about that argument, if it can be dignified by the word `argument'. If one says that one State has a lower net financing requirement than any other State, that is another way of saying that Queensland's finances are in the best shape of any State in the Commonwealth. Again, that argument sits oddly with the perpetual, repetitious comments to the contrary emanating from the Minister for Finance time and again in this place during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be noted that in any case the ABS figures which are referred to are themselves subject to manifold deficiencies in some respects. For example Queensland is the only State which actually funds its own superannuation liabilities. As a consequence, it has a build-up in net financial assets which is not paralleled in any other State-a factor which enters into these comparisons. The fact that Queensland chooses to provide for its future superannuation liabilities, not merely unlike any other State but unlike the Commonwealth, should not surely be held to be a basis for penalising that State; rather it should be a basis for, if anything, congratulating it. In any case, as I have already indicated, such prudent financial behaviour hardly accords with the kind of picture of Queensland as a spendthrift and feckless financial State which the Minister for Finance time and again presents in the Senate. </PARA>

Senator Stone is relatively new to the Senate. I have been here a little longer than he has, but every time we address the States grants Bills it becomes obvious that Queensland bears the brunt of Labor's attack. Queensland and Tasmania pay the heavy penalty of voting for conservative governments. Since 1983 Queensland has done very poorly in the distribution of the Commonwealth funds that this Bill cuts up. I often wonder what Queensland senators Black, Burns, Jones, Colston and Reynolds do, apart from throwing dorothy dixers to Senator Walsh and allowing him blatantly to attack Queensland and the Queensland economy. We should look at how Queensland is funded in the State revenue Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

One does not have to be Einstein or even an economist to work that out. Even Senator Walsh would be able to tell us that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No State has been worse affected than my State of Queensland. What was the Queensland Government offered at the last Premiers Conference? It is no wonder the Premier walked out in disgust. He did the only thing possible for him to do. He sought the same per capita level of financial assistance in real terms, full and immediate implementation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommendation, which would have meant about $40m extra for Queensland, and willingness on the part of the Commonwealth to share equitably the burden of financial restraint. But the Federal Government has shown absolutely no restraint. It has passed all the restraint onto the States, while the States offered a continuation of cooperation in the national economic interest. What did the Commonwealth Government give? A 4.2 per cent reduction in real terms in general revenue grants; only part implementation-about 50 per cent-of the Grants Commission's recommendations; and a 32 per cent reduction in the Queensland share of the global borrowing limit-meaning a reduction of $367m for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> What, we may ask, does this mean for Queensland? The failure to maintain the per capita level of assistance in real terms cost Queensland $112m; failure to implement fully Grants Commission recommendations, $17m; failure to maintain in dollar terms the same global borrowing limit, $367m; and failure to maintain the global limit in real per capita terms, another $66m. All up, Queensland lost $562m, or $220 for every man, woman and child in the State. That is the unjust and inequitable treatment that this Government has handed to the Queensland State Government. What have we heard from Senator Colston, Senator Jones, Senator Reynolds and Senator Black? Not a peep. We say to those honourable senators on the Government side that they are letting Queensland down very badly. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate an article in the Sunday Sun last week. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Mt Olivet Hospital is seeking Federal funding to avert a financial catastrophe which would close more wards, reduce staff and restrict existing services. </PARA>
<PARA>The article says that a Mount Olivet spokesman said that the predicament was a direct result of the Federal Government's decision to withdraw its $670,000 annual grant. No wonder we see these types of articles running in the Queensland press. Hospitals are closing and old people's homes are not able to provide the services required. The Queensland Government has been forced into reducing some of the services it can offer. I say to the people of Queensland, when they complain about these reductions in services, that they should take their complaints to Government senators and Ministers. No-one should expect, following the reductions in funding that this Government has offered Queensland, the Queensland Government to sustain the services and facilities required by the Queensland people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not here to answer Senator Maguire's interjections; I want to address serious matters affecting my State of Queensland. Let us look at road funding, including the bicentennial road development program; education; housing assistance; general purpose capital grants; and Medicare funding-all areas in which Queensland has suffered underfunding. On a per capita basis, in the tertiary education field Queensland is down $43.5m and on housing assistance it is down nearly $13m. In fact, if Queensland received the normal per capita funding offered to every other State in Australia it would be able to provide housing for another 1,200 homeless people in Queensland. We are down $45.5m in the funding of bicentennial roads and, although Queensland has 16.7 per cent of Australia's population, it receives 7.1 per cent of general purpose capital grants. Of course Queensland suffers an incredible loss in Medicare funding. It receives only $31 per person in Medicare funding compared with $65 per person in New South Wales. It gets worse when we compare Queensland with the other States. For example, South Australia receives $90 per person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the sorts of things that I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate. Funding is inequitable and Queenslanders have had to put up with this for the last five or six years during which this Federal Government has been in office. It is high time that people became aware of this discrimination against the Queensland and Tasmanian governments. I have put these claims before the Senate and it is high time that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) took such comments on board and endeavoured to answer the points raised and the protests I have put forward on behalf of all the Queensland people, who are not receiving their fair share of Federal Government funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Messner to the motion that the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill be read a second time. I think the amendment is very timely indeed. I do not intend to canvass the issues raised by Senator Messner, Senator Watson, Senator Stone and Senator Boswell. What I am concerned about is that this proposal sets a dangerous precedent and one that all State governments must have regard to. If we are to maintain this Federation, we must ensure that the way the Federal Government can tighten and control by fiscal policy can be audited by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel that very grave issues have been raised tonight. I was quite disconcerted to hear from a person who had heard from another quite senior person the view expressed that this Government, for the first time, appeared to be exercising its fiscal policies in a manner which had regard to political considerations. The person who said that indicated that even in the Whitlam days that was not so: that the States were treated as responsible units of this Federation and thus the payments were made to the States on that basis. Senator Watson's amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) this Government's prospective 1988-89 budget surplus is mostly based on increased taxation, and over 70 per cent of the expenditure cuts in budget outlays comes from reduced payments to state governments;</PARA>
<PARA>That appears to me to be a statement of fact and therefore it deserves support. Similarly, in point (c) the amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA>the arrangements outlined in the Bill reflect policies that discourage the incentive to invest and work productively and therefore facilitate the restructuring of the Australian economy to address the nation's net foreign debt of some $88 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important piece of legislation and, as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is now in the chamber, I am very anxious to hear what he has to say in response to the matters that have been raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak for long. We have heard the usual confusion of views from the Opposition which, on the one hand, is very keen on reducing expenditure but which, on the other, complains when it actually happens. Senator Watson suggested that we should cut another $7 billion from Commonwealth outlays. I have given a similar invitation to Senator Watson's colleagues before and I will give it to him now: I would be very pleased to receive from him at any time specifics of the $7 billion which he thinks should be cut from Commonwealth outlays. The Opposition has two modes, and it slips from one to the other in a very confused way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of funding to the States over the past couple of years, one very important fact should be noted. In 1986-87, the States' general purpose payments-I am not sure whether they were called financial assistance grants then; a comparable payment, anyway-had a 2 per cent increase in real terms. One could certainly argue that in that critical 1986-87 Budget the Commonwealth should not have been so generous to the States. If that argument had been put, it would have to be counted as legitimate. However, the States received a 2 per cent increase in their general purpose payments in the 1986-87 Budget at a time when real wages, which comprised the great bulk of State government expenditure, were actually falling. It is difficult to make a judgment as to the combined effect of those two factors, but it probably meant an effective increase in real terms of about 4 per cent in that particular year. That needed to be clawed back and it has been clawed back. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone referred to the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates of net borrowing requirements of Queensland in particular, and it is important to note that for a number of years all the States had hollow logs stuffed with money from their excess borrowings when they actually accumulated cash reserves during the permissive regime which applied in the early 1980s in the period of the so-called resources boom-which never happened. There is an element of judgment-Senator Stone would probably call it arbitrariness-in that assessment. Queensland still had a very much larger cash reserve, or money stuffed in hollow logs if one prefers that term, than the other States. There was an element of judgment in that, but it would be welcomed by the Commonwealth if Queensland, or indeed all the States, made a proper disclosure of their financial assets. If they were to do that, the Commonwealth would be in a much better position to make accurate judgments than it now is. Queensland not only does not, in common with most other States, make a proper disclosure of its financial assets but, to the best of my knowledge, it still does not have even a public accounts committee-an issue on which I understand Senator Boswell expressed some sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA> On the points that Senator Stone raised relating to the definitions in clause 3 I am advised that legal advice has been received that State owned banks or insurance corporations cannot be included within that definition of State owned corporations. Senator Stone also mentioned clause 7 and said that the States were not borrowing on their own account, but the Commonwealth was borrowing on behalf of the States. I am afraid that is not correct. In fact the Commonwealth is not borrowing at all this year. It is funding from general budget revenue the Commonwealth grants to the States by way of loan for general purpose capital funding which, in most previous years if not all, would effectively have been a borrowing on behalf of the States by the Commonwealth which was then passed on to the States and was repayable over varying periods. But of course, the Commonwealth is not a borrower at all this year. Because of the Budget surplus it is a net lender. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone's major point was about the `disciplining' of Queensland. I was at the relevant Premiers Conference, and Queensland, alone of all the States, said it would not agree to the borrowing limits which had been proposed. The Queensland Government was then told that if it would not agree to those borrowing limits, then a clause, such as clause 7, would be inserted into the legislation and that the Government would take action in that way. Clause 7 applies to all the States; it is there because Queensland stated that it would not agree to the borrowing limits as all the other States had done. The clause is not discriminatory; it applies to all the States. It does not give the Treasurer unfettered discretion to decide whether States' borrowings or those of their instrumentalities are excessive. If clause 7 were to be activated, the Treasurer would be bound to determine what constituted the excessive borrowing in accordance with arrangements agreed with other States-in other words, to enforce the global approach resolution of the Loan Council which was accepted by all States other than Queensland and which defines in detail what constitutes a borrowing, subject to the global limits. The Acting Treasurer wrote to the Premiers recently to reassure them on that specific point, so I am informed. Clause 7 will be activated only if it has been determined that a State has deliberately or through reckless disregard breached the global limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to make relates to the second reading amendment. The Government will, of course, oppose it. I do not intend to spend a great deal of time on it but the bald assertion that most of the 1988-89 prospective Budget surplus is based on increased taxation is simply not true. There have been reductions in various indirect taxes. There has been a significant reduction in beer excise, not fully offset by the new sales tax on alcohol. There have been other reductions in indirect taxes as well. It is true that, as the income tax rate scale has not been adjusted since the previous financial year, there is an element of fiscal drag-of the order of $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion, with the growth in income that is later to occur-which does not produce most of the Budget surplus. I do not intend to delay the passage of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Prime Minister of this country promised income relief next year to the elderly in this country. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that today leading pensioner groups were not too pleased with Mr Hawke's promise of relief next year because they said that the majority of the nation's 1.7 million pensioners were suffering and needed more money immediately. The leader of the Grey Power lobby group, Mr Stan Duncan, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Prime Minister's statement last night offered little hope. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We do not need changes in the next 12 months-we need them now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's economic brutality has created a lot of unnecessary fear on the part of elderly people. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more with him. I think this is one indication of how out of touch this Government is with the concerns of ordinary people and how the living standards of ordinary people, including the elderly, have deteriorated under 5 1/2 years of Hawke Labor rule. Mr Duncan drew attention to a couple of measures which he believed would help elderly people. One of them was to increase the tax-free level of pensioner incomes from the current threshold of $6,800 to $10,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested in this suggestion because a letter from a constituent has come to my notice which I felt was of such importance that the Senate should hear it. I do not wish to reveal the identity of the author so as to conceal the identity of the person to whom he is referring. However, it puts in a nutshell the very problem that is being faced by elderly people in our country, thanks to 5 1/2 years of Labor rule. The letter is addressed to the Commissioner of Taxation in Tasmania and reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir/Madam,</PARA>
<PARA> The INCOME TAX forms are completed as requested and enclosed herewith for your Hobart office. </PARA>
<PARA> As son of Mrs X, the widow for whom the taxation papers apply, I submit the following statements for your kind consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> My mother is 90 years old and very frail. </PARA>
<PARA> She has been a widow for over 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> During these 20 years she has laboured at no charge and with no income to assist at the city mission and Old People's Homes etc. Throughout Launceston. (For example, sorting old clothing for the poor, etc.). Hers has been a labour of love. Where most would use a car or taxi, Mother has walked! She has NEVER owned a car. She has NEVER kept money and kind, but given it away to help the needy, unfortunate, hospitalized, disabled and thousands of people like those who mostly claim Government assistance. Mother's bank balance has always been low. Kept to the barest minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years she has tried hard to save a little cash to be able to buy a new bed, heater and paint the home and attend to a few repairs and maintenance items, including replacing a 20 year old gas stove!</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the increased bank interest on her savings for these repair items has put her in a tax situation. The first time in her life! How sad! The living members of Mum's family are broken hearted. What can we do? Please be gracious in this matter and these unfortunate circumstances. I know Mum appreciates the pension and thank you; but for a 90 YEAR OLD who has practically nothing and has given most of her life for helping others in the community it appears totally unjust if she should have to pay INCOME TAX!</PARA>
<PARA> My Mother is VERY well known throughout Tasmania and should you wish to verify any statement or seek any references, please contact the likes of CITY MISSIONS, Launceston or Hobart, Old Peoples Homes, Superintendent of Police, Church Ministers and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> PLEASE HELP US. </PARA>
<PARA> Mother does not know I'm writing, therefore please send your reply to me at the above address as any Government Correspondence may upset Mum's deteriorating health. </PARA>
<PARA> This letter IS NOT A COMPLAINT, but simply stating the honest truth about a 90 YEAR OLD WIDOW who serves God and her community and this gentle, kind lady happens to be my MOTHER. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, Mr X</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Government of this country: What has it done that it could possibly be so out of touch with the elderly and the poor, quite apart from family members, that it can allow elderly people such as Mrs X to be in this situation? She is not well off. In fact, she is very poorly off and has been all her life, as that letter reveals. Yet, thanks to this Government's direct policies and intentions, she is now in a situation where, for the first time in her life, at the age of 90 she is liable for income tax. What a callous, disgusting government. Surely it should take action in matters such as this and do something to help the elderly, who have contributed so much to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to speak at length in this adjournment debate. I draw to the attention of the Senate an Anzac Day address which was given by the Reverend Dr Malcolm Mackay at the 1988 Anzac Day dawn service in Canberra. I came across this address because it was sent to me by a leading Australian businessman, who was very impressed by the sentiments it contained. The copy he sent to me was published in the Mining Review of August 1988. Essentially, the address is a plea for greater unity and understanding in Australia. I think the sentiments are extremely good and ought to be considered by many Australians as they focus on the position of Aboriginal Australians. I think what Dr Mackay has to say is well worth consideration. Because we are not broadcasting and there are very few senators here to speak in the adjournment debate I do not propose to read this address. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of Dr Mackay's address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Forging the Foundations of National Unity</PARA>
<PARA> As the debate about the future of Australia's Aborigines gathers pace, the Rev. Dr Malcolm Mackay looks at some past and future factors affecting their place in Australian society. Dr Mackay, a minister of the Presbyterian Church, served in the Australian Parliament from 1963 to 1972 and was Minister for the Navy in the McMahon Government from 1971 to 1972. Before joining the Federal Ministry he had been chairman of a group of oil and mineral exploration companies, while maintaining his interest in church affairs. This article is based on an address he delivered at the 1988 Anzac Day dawn service in Canberra, which was broadcast throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Anzac Day 1988 calls for straight thinking and bold speaking. Australia today is in peril, and we who symbolise her defence have a duty to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not dwell on the disastrous erosion of our armed services. My theme is nearer home. The land we love is in danger of losing its integrity, its very foundations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three things we need desperately today: a balanced view of the past; a willingness to change; and the guts to start with ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In this dawn hour my heart goes back to a simple grave marked by the rising sun of the First AIF. My mother lies there. She was an ANZAC. Beside her lies my father. They met at Gallipoli, 73 years ago. My mind travels to France, and I see Verdun with those acres of crosses, and the huge charnel house for the bones of the unidentifiable. More than a million young men lie there. Then across the battlefields of the Somme and beyond, the cemeteries stretch. Is there not something here we must place at the heart of our celebration in 1988? All of us?</PARA>
<PARA> My Aboriginal brothers and sisters-you too! Do you imagine for one moment that your ancestors could have simply gone on and on, living as they did before 1788-even if no Britishers had come to these shores? All Europe was reaching out for expansion and empire. Every Australian, new and old, should join in celebration and it was Britain which won the day. Do you believe any other European, or indeed Asian power would have made a better developer?</PARA>
<PARA> Coming nearer our time, had we lost World War II, had the Nazi Germany triumphed, can any of our Aboriginal or Asian friends believe that Hitler's mad dream of racial supremacy would have treated them better? Surely there is room for celebration here by all who love freedom and the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Some argue that the cruelties of those days and the deprivation of lands held by our earliest inhabitants condemns any celebration. Fair enough. But . . . </PARA>
<PARA> My wife and I were recently in the far north-west of Scotland, in ancestral Mackay country. Historians describe the Mackays as direct descendants of the aboriginal inhabitants of that country. What did I find? In an area where once small farms were so numerous that a regiment of soldiers was raised there, well after 1788, there are now only lonely patches of blackened stones and a few cinders of rafters. My people, like other Highlanders and many of the Irish, were driven out of their tribal lands by bayonet, fire and brutality-long years after Cook came to Botany Bay. My point is this: it was wrong to take the moral values of the twentieth century and simply apply them to the eighteenth. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1788 the final rules for possessing any land were two-the capacity to defend it, and the ability to develop it. In those days there was no integrated Australian people, no national consciousness, no capacity to bring agriculture and animal husbandry and mining to the least habitable continent on earth. It is only recently, and very largely due to the British and Judao-Christian influences of the years that have intervened, that more humane values are emerging. Surely that is something every Australian ought to celebrate. </PARA>
<PARA>Willingness to change</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Great changes are needed if we are to make this the kind of nation our Aboriginal people have a right to expect and our pioneers and our defenders have given their lives to create. But let me sound a solemn warning. The most dangerous enemies Australia faces today are those who use every good cause, every need for change as a means of dividing and polarising the nation. This is true of our environment, of education, of the status of women. And, especially in this bicentennial year, it is true of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those active destroyers in our midst whose real motivation is to exploit every grievance and sharpen every possibility of division in their lust for power. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole world today needs desperately to find a better way than violence and war. Sheer survival as a race depends on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell you a true story. A conference in Argentina recently was sponsored by a group of people with the conviction that there was no way ahead for many personal or national confrontations merely on the basis of appeals to the past, to justice or the use of force. The only victorious way was for a wiping clean of the slate-for total forgiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> At that conference there was the officer who had commanded the Argentinian ground forces in the Falklands war. He saw that only Almighty God could give people the guts to forgive and show them the way that this should be done. He had a most compelling thought-that he should go to Britain and seek out his opposite number in the British regiment which had carried out the counter-invasion. He obeyed that thought. In London he contacted the chaplain of the regiment, who tried in vain to arrange a meeting between the two men. Two days later, the British officer phoned to say that he felt it his duty to meet the Argentinian. When the visitor's car arrived at regimental headquarters the British officer was outside, waiting. As the Argentinian moved towards him he strode forward, and, literally in tears, they silently embraced. </PARA>
<PARA> There are greater forces in the world than hatred, vengence, violence, racial feuds and lust for power. We can no longer afford the luxury of reviving the past, from which both sides can easily obtain vindication for enmity. We must build a new future based on mutual respect and growing co-operation, which require costly forgiveness, and insistence on the equality of all Australians before God, the law and each other. </PARA>
<PARA>Start with ourselves</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We should remember that many later comers to this land have also been dispossessed people . . . the convicts, the Highland Scots, the Irish farmers, the so-called captive nations of Europe, the Indo-Chinese . . . the list is great. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we forge the foundations of national unity?</PARA>
<PARA> It begins with true listening, to each other and to the still small voice of Almighty God. It is high time we made a determined attempt to listen to our friends of other cultures and races, or, as the Indians put it, ``to walk a mile in the other man's moccasins.'' That takes guts. Most of us find it easier to defend our ghettos than to reach out to our neighbour who is different. My challenge to all who have served and love Australia is to make persistent endeavours this year to bridging the race and culture gap-to listen to and really hear the other man or woman, and deep inside ourselves to heed the inner voice which for each of us is the final arbiter of right and wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> One last thought. This country had been the country of choice of millions of people of varied races and cultures who have decided to make their homes here. Why? Because there had been something about our way of life, our British traditions, our Christian values, our rules of law and democratic government which decided them to trust their lives and their children's lives to us. Let those who decide our future be warned. If those values and those standards are eroded and destroyed, if our roots are severed and we become an amorphous disunited mob, then we will be easy prey to the enemy within as well as to challenge from without. </PARA>
<PARA> It is still true that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance-matched with sacrifice-by all Australians, together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express concern at the difficulty one has in extracting information from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), notwithstanding the recent reported suggestion that there will be a full inquiry into the Aboriginal Development Commission and, I assume, the Department generally. I refer to the fact that only as a result of an application under freedom of information have I been able to get a number of audits. The audits have demonstrated grave impropriety in two cases and maladministration in a third.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As recently as 24 October, when I made an application for a refund of the fees payable under freedom of information, I was advised by the Department that it had carefully considered the grounds cited in support of my request. However, it considered that there were insufficient public interest grounds to remit the fees and charges levied. I do not mind the $25 or $30 required to provide me with the information, but it seems to fly in the face of contentions that the Government is concerned to ensure that the finances and the management and the administration of the Department are adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of a speech I gave in this Parliament in respect of the Oombulgurri community, which had lost in excess of $100,000. The white bookkeeper had disappeared, either with or without the money. There were businesses in the town of Wyndham that were unable to pay their bills because they found themselves major creditors to the Oombulgurri community. As I have said, the audit demonstrated grave concern for the finances. I understood from the Department at the time we were having a Committee of the Whole discussion on Estimates that it was looking for the bookkeeper, it was looking to find out where the money was, and it was going to take appropriate action if it could find either. To my knowledge, nothing since that point has been done in respect of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I then raised the matter of the Marra Worra Worra Association. I found that there were grave irregularities with the management of its finances. It received cheques to the value of $2.6m each year in the form of what is known commonly as `chuck in'. In other words, these poor souls would get their pensions or their social welfare benefits provided to the group which then cashed it in a lump sum. On occasions there was a float of up to $100,000. The Marra Worra Worra group did not even have a safe adequate enough to put the money in. Be that as it may, a spot audit found up to $10,000 in discrepancies in the float. In fact, a test float done on 27 August 1987 revealed further errors totalling $26,239. The Corporation operated a trust account and received and disbursed income tax refund cheques on behalf of members. The books of account were not properly maintained, resulting in a shortfall of trust funds totalling $8,859 which were made good from corporation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not bother to read again to the Senate a copy of that speech, but it is there to be read by those who have a concern for these matters. The more recent outrage is the letter from the Department when I required audited statements from the Wangkatjungka Community Inc. I have only quickly read what the auditor said about that community. On page 1 of his report he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The books of account generally were not maintained in a manner to enable them to be properly and conveniently audited. In the absence of detail many generalisations of income expenditures have been made in financial reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The community store was operated by members until November 1986 when a community store manager was employed. Prior to November store takings were not regularly banked and resulted in apparent trading losses of $8,597 as disclosed in the accounts. Subsequent to November 1986 the store has functioned at a profit. Because of the limited staff in the store internal control over sales income is not practical. However, the gross profit margin suggests that store takings are being now correctly reported. </PARA>
<PARA>In another paragraph the auditor says:</PARA>
<PARA> In my audit report of 30 June 1986 I highlighted the lack of control and records for the consumption of diesel fuel in the electricity generators. To the best of my knowledge adequate control and records are still not maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>What caused him to raise his eyebrows about the dieseline fuel generators for the electricity was that in the cool months when the air-conditioner was not required the consumption of diesel fuel went up. Clearly it was being stolen, not to mention the fact that wages were being paid to the operator who did not even live there. To my knowledge nothing has been done about that. I could talk about the fact that the auditor complained about private aircraft charters by a white man associated with the community to travel back and forth to Derby. I could talk about the 43 cases of beer-that is the figure I recall-put down as being for the entertainment of visiting guests. They must have had the Labor Party Caucus, for goodness sake-43 cartons to entertain guests. And so it went on. To my knowledge there has been no adequate response from the Government. </PARA>

<PARA> I shall not be deterred by the letter from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that tells me that I should not have a refund because this is not a public interest matter. What is? There a number of communities in the north-west of Western Australia in which money is being stolen, misappropriated or mismanaged. To my knowledge nothing has been done about it. This is the third time I have raised it in the Parliament. On the information I have available to me now, what I have said so far is just the tip of the iceberg of incompetence and, I suspect, if stealing is corruption, of corruption. I intend to pursue the matter, notwithstanding the fact that the only way I can get the information is under the freedom of information legislation and that I am told to pay for it because my application is not in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, but they will go down the tube before I go broke. I have no intention of letting the matter rest. I ask the fundamental question: What is in the public interest if not the disclosure of auditors' reports that say the books are so bad that they cannot possibly be audited? So far I have only touched the edge, scratched the surface, of Marra Worra Worra, Wangkatjungka and Oombulgurri.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will mention Kalumburu because I happen to be on my feet. This group, when I last checked, was technically insolvent but it had the Department examining the prospect of having its own aeroplane. One of the reasons the Oombulgurri group is bankrupt is that it charters aircraft to fly from Oombulgurri across the Cambridge Gulf to Wyndham to cart cartons of beer back and forth for them. It has an aerial taxi service. I am not saying that the Department has agreed but it has undertaken a feasibility study. One wonders why there is racism, indignation, anger and rage in the north-west of Western Australia. We should not blame the black communities or the white communities; we should blame incompetent management and bad government. If one looks at these audit reports one can see that the DAA itself has made no effort to put matters right. I just hope that next time I apply for information that reveals bad management and dishonesty in these groups the Department will be gracious enough at least to concede that it is in the public interest that such information be on the public record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Newman, short of contacting Archbishop Clancy tomorrow to see whether we can attempt to have mum canonised, there is not much I can do. I will, however, pass on to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) her comments. From what I hear, he has said that income relief will not come to pensioners until next year. He has, however, not ruled out relief to pensioners sooner than that. I think it is a matter of waiting to see what the Prime Minister comes up with. I am sure that whatever he comes up with will be targeted to those most in need. In that respect, I ought to make the point that since this Government has come to office those on pensions are now receiving more than 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, whereas when we came to office they were receiving 21 per cent.

I will pursue with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) the question of the definition of public interest in the answering of freedom of information requests. I hope I can provide the honourable senator with specific answers on that in the next few days.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 22 October 1987:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that the cost to develop the Fairmont Resort in the Blue Mountains has escalated from $25 million to over $45 million; if so, how much of these development costs will be funded by the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How can the allocation of these funds from the AIDC be justified given the fact that the proposed development has been questioned by local residents on environmental and financial grounds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand that the development costs of the Fairmont Resort, including pre-opening costs and working capital, amount to approximately $55 million. The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) arranged, syndicated and participated in a funding package of equity and loans for the development. I do not know what proportion of the development costs were met by the AIDC as such. Details of the financial arrangements are commercially confidential.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have previously expressed my own satisfaction that AIDC made proper enquiries about the environmental impact of the development in response to a question without notice by Senator Janine Haines on 10 April 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> AIDC considers the Resort to be an attractive investment. Its proximity to Sydney is an important factor in drawing custom from metropolitan families, from the corporate meetings market and from overseas visitors. From a national perspective, it is helping to relieve the first-class accommodation shortage which was a constraint on the growth of international tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> The Resort has created employment in a region suffering from a high level of unemployment. Of the 200 permanent and over 100 casual staff that have been engaged and trained, over 90 per cent are from the local community, the bulk of whom have not previously worked in the hospitality industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 19 May 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What measures is the Government taking to co-ordinate the control of flow of industrial effluent into Australia's waterways.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What is being done to control the use and disposal of organo tin based anti-fouling paints which have been shown to be extremely toxic to estuary marine life, shellfish and other aquacultural species.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth controls the dumping of wastes, including industrial wastes, in Australian waters through the provisions of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981. For dumping purposes, Australian waters extend from internationally agreed baselines outwards for 200 nautical miles. Inwards, Australian waters extend to low water mark but do not include waters within the limits of a State. However, the discharge of effluent from land-based pipelines falls outside the ambit of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The control of discharge of industrial effluent into waters within the limits of a State, or through landbased pipelines, is a State responsibility. Permits issued by State authorities to discharge waste water specify quality standards to control or prevent undesirable effects such as pollution of the adjacent coast of waters.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) State and Northern Territory registrars of pesticides have agreed to take steps to require registration of organotin based antifouling paints by 1 July 1989. Paints which release the active organotin constituent into the water at a rate exceeding prescribed limits will not be registered. The label of registered antifouling paints will contain instructions for safe disposal of wastes and containers. These instructions will be legally binding under State pesticides legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the concentration of organotin in estuarine waters is highly dependent on local conditions such as boat numbers and tidal flushing, it will be necessary to continue to monitor concentrations in sensitive areas to determine whether further steps need to be taken. A number of State governments and other bodies will be undertaking this work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The World Heritage Bureau recommended in June this year that the World Heritage Committee inscribe the Wet Tropical Rainforests of North East Australia on the World Heritage List. The Bureau also requested further information from Australia by 1 October on future management arrangements for the area, revision of the delimitation of the nominated area and some issues of land ownership and use.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been extensive discussions between members and officials of the Commonwealth and Queensland governments about these and related issues since the Bureau meeting. A progress report was submitted to the World Heritage Committee Secretariat at the end of September, as requested by the Bureau. The Queensland Government has been sent a copy of that Report, together with a letter proposing further discussions on the details of the nomination.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Queensland Government has continued with its December 1987 application to the High Court seeking permanent injunctions to restrain Commonwealth Government actions connected with World Heritage nomination and protection of the Wet Tropical rainforests.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Commonwealth Government has provided $75.3 million for a structural adjustment package for those affected by the cessation of rainforest logging.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to $50.9 million will be used over the next three years to create jobs and provide other adjustment assistance for displaced workers. Jobs will be created in reafforestation, World Heritage area management, public works and by providing seed money for private and community initiatives. Other adjustment assistance measures include a dislocation allowance, wage subsidies, retraining, relocation assistance and, for workers aged 55 years and over, an early retirement payment of up to $30,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to $24.4 million is available as compensation for companies and businesses substantially and directly affected by the cessation of commercial forestry operations in north Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) As at 23 September 1988, 186 workers were eligible for assistance. All have been paid the dislocation allowance, with 81 taking up offers of alternative employment, nine undertaking retraining, six being assisted with relocation and seven being given wage subsidies. The remainder of the displaced workers have either found alternative employment, have applied for the early retirement payment or have chosen not to take up any adjustment assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to business compensation an initial payment has been made to Hancock Bros Pty Ltd, while financial assistance is being provided to the Associated Plywood Sales mill at Ravenshoe to enable it to re-tool to process plantation timber. Compensation offers have been made to a number of other companies, while claims from other businesses are being assessed.</PARA>
