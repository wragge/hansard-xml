<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 February 1988 the Senate referred to the Court of Disputed Returns certain questions relating to the place in the Senate representing New South Wales to which William Robert Wood was returned in the 1987 election. On 12 May 1988, in answer to those questions, the Court found that the place in the Senate was vacant. I presented to the Senate on 17 May 1988 the reasons for judgment of the Court in relation to that finding. I now present the judgment and reasons relating to those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Senate last met, the Court has made two further orders in relation to the matter referred to it. On 7 June 1988 the Court ordered that the Australian Electoral Officer for New South Wales undertake a further counting and recounting of the ballot papers cast for candidates in the election in that State, for the purpose of determining the candidate entitled to be elected to the vacant place, and that the Australian Electoral Officer for the State report that result to the Court. On 21 July 1988, having received that report, the Court ordered that Irina Patsi Dunn be declared elected as a senator for New South Wales in the vacant place in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I now present to the Senate the orders of the Court of 7 June and 21 July 1988, together with reasons relating to the first of those orders. Having been declared to be elected, Senator Dunn will now be introduced and will make the oath or affirmation before taking her seat in the Senate, as required by the Constitution.</PARA>

<PARA>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR NINIAN STEPHEN, GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, ON THE OCCASION OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENT IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA ON MONDAY, 22 AUGUST 1988</PARA>
<PARA> I begin with a message from Her Majesty the Queen, sent on this historic occasion:</PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to learn that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia today begins its work in its new home. I have happy memories of the opening ceremony which, for me, was a highlight of the bicentennial year. I take this opportunity to send to the people of the Commonwealth of Australia my heartfelt wishes for their prosperity and happiness and am confident that the deliberations of the Parliament in this new building will be directed to that end.</PARA>
<PARA>Elizabeth R.</PARA>
<PARA>22 August 1988</PARA>
<PARA> Nations, like people, take their shape, their style and character, from their inheritance and from their environment. If today is, for Australia, historic, it is because this occasion, today, in the nation's capital, is the outcome of all that has shaped Australia over the past 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA> For thousands of years the first inhabitants of this then isolated continent lived their lives free of the need of principles for the governance of a nation in the modern world. But from the first day of that landing of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove 200 years ago, perhaps in all history the most curious of beginnings of any nation, a policy has been evolving: from governor's rule of a penal settlement, through stages of representative and then responsible government, first colonial and then federal and national, to this day; the day when, for the first time, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will sit in its own permanent home in the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA> Today when the members of this Parliament take their seats in the two chambers of this Parliament House they will know that in doing so they mark a momentous milestone in the long history of Australian democracy. That spirit of democracy asserted itself in colonial days and was the sure foundation upon which our federal nation was created. It has been dear to us ever since.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the third home of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Our Constitution makes short work of Parliament's place of sitting; almost abruptly it declares, in section 125, that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government.</PARA>
<PARA>And sit in Melbourne it did, in borrowed splendour, for a quarter of a century, in that great palace at the top of Bourke Street, Victoria's own Parliament House, while the seat of government was duly determined and a provisional Parliament House build there, in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> It sat in Melbourne from its first day of sitting on the afternoon of 9th May 1901, until late in the afternoon of 24th March 1927. Then, both to the intensely emotional strains of Auld Lang Syne and to the no less intense relief of long dispossessed Victorian legislators, it adjourned; to meet next, in May 1927, in Canberra in that much more modest, white stuccoed brick building down the hill which, to the minds of at least three generations of Australians, has been the symbol of our federal parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, some sixty years on, Federal Parliament moves again but Australia's long traditions of democracy continue unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA> As the measure of these things goes in the world community of nations, Australia is among the most enduring continuous democracies that the world has known, even if we reckon only from the time of Federation, which incidentally, does scant justice to our own vigorous colonial democracies of the second half of last century.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from Britain, from which our free institutions spring, and the two great democracies of North America, no one of the now many nations of Asia, Africa, or the Americas, and only two, I think, of all the nations of Europe can count a similar uninterrupted span of over 87 years of democratic government-years of governments which have come to power by the free vote of the people and which have at all times held themselves effectively accountable to the people.</PARA>
<PARA> This great new Parliament House is itself a celebration of our democracy, of the success on this continent of what, in the heady days of Britain's reform Bills of the last century, was thought to be a too hazardous experiment: the giving of the vote to all of the people. We inherited from Britain the traditions of parliamentary democracy; we took from the United States its own bold experiment in federalism. Then, bolder still, we combined the two and produced a federal and parliamentary commonwealth of which this building now becomes the symbol.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we Australians haven't in the past been very strong on symbols; at least away from the sporting field. We like to think we don't place much store by them or by the titles of office. That has always been the style of our democracy. But here on Capital Hill, we now have a symbol we can't ignore, one that will remind the Australian people of the weight of responsibility that rests on those it elects to Parliament, that will affirm to all who are elected to represent the nation in this house of the Parliament that it is upon the quality of their deliberations and the wisdom of their decisions that this nation's future and the welfare of all Australians, now and long into the future, will depend. May the splendour of this building inspire them, and the nation, to high achievement and to noble goals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the following resolutions be agreed to-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Senate expresses its thanks and appreciation of the Parliaments, Governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and to those organisations which have so graciously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House and extends a warm welcome to those Presiding Officers and representatives who are present today. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the Senate extends its sincere thanks to the following persons and organisations associated with the planning and construction of the new Parliament House:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Mitchell/Giurgola and Thorp Architects who designed it,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Parliament House Construction Authority, Concrete/Holland Joint Venture and all contractors and workers who built it,</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the artists, craftsmen and craftswomen who advised on and assisted in its furnishing and decoration, and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the members of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, all past and present members of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission, parliamentary and other staff,</PARA>
<PARA> for their endeavours in providing a magnificent permanent building for the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, on the historic first sitting day in this building, I should like to take the opportunity to express the appreciation of the Parliament, the Government and the people of Australia to the parliaments, governments and peoples of those countries, States and Territories and those organisations which have generously presented gifts to Australia's new Parliament House. It is particularly pleasing that representatives of many of those donors, including the presiding officers of other parliaments, are able to be with us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The internal spaces of the building now display the embroideries, tapestries, paintings, maps and other gifts, sent here from the four corners of the world and the four corners of Australia. They are already part of this building's own history. Outside there are sculptures, benches and trees presented by our friends to add to the environment of the new building. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate, Mr President, that I make special mention of the gifts located within this chamber: the vice-regal chair, a gift from the Parliament of the United Kingdom; the distinguished visitors chair, from the New Zealand Parliament; your own chair, Mr President, which is a gift from the Canadian Senate; and the Hansard table, a gift from the Government, Parliament and people of Tasmania. All these gifts will remind us and future generations of parliamentarians of our international ties, our bonds with the Australian States and the responsibility that we owe to the Australian people to cherish and preserve our system of parliamentary democracy. In expressing my thanks to those who join us for this special day and to those who have presented gifts, I believe they share our pride in this great building. Their generosity indicates the respect in which Australia's system of parliamentary democracy is held. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the care and dedication that have gone into the construction of this building give us a lasting debt of gratitude to all those men and women who have been involved. To the architects, Romaldo Giurgola and Richard Thorp, we say thank you for your vision in designing a building of which all Australians, present and future, can be justly proud. We thank also the Chairman, members and the Chief Executive of the Parliament House Construction Authority and their staff for their hard work and dedication throughout the construction phase of the building. To Concrete Holland Joint Venture, the Construction Manager, and all the other contractors and workers involved in the project who, by the labour of their minds and bodies, have made it the remarkable reality it is, we also express our gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recall the work which has been done by the members of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, officers of the National Capital Development Commission, and parliamentary and other staff in the building. The new Parliament House embodies the work of over 10,000 men and women, with contributions from individuals and manufacturers from every State and Territory. It is a national showcase demonstrating the skills and energy of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the integration of Australian art and craft into the new Parliament House is a key part of the building's architectural expression. The artists, craftsmen and craftswomen have created significant works now displayed throughout the building. The `meeting place' mosaic designed by Papunya artist Michael Nelson Tjakamarra and fabricated by masons William McIntosh, Aldo Rossi and Franco Colussi stands in the centre of the ceremonial pool at the heart of the forecourt and is appropriately the first work of art visitors see when approaching this building. In the Great Hall the tapestry by 14 weavers of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop dramatically depicts an Australian coastal landscape created from paintings by Arthur Boyd. In the first floor public gallery the embroidery designed by South Australian artist Kay Lawrence and produced by more than 1,000 members of the Embroiderers Guild of Australia narrates the history of Australians' involvement with the land. The marquetry designed by South Australian Tony Bishop and interpreted by Sydney craftsman Michael Retter can be found in the formal entrance foyer and elsewhere in the building. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many more craftspeople and artists who have contributed to the national character of the new Parliament House. I instance Tasmanian woodworker Kevin Perkins and others who have handcrafted tables and desks for the use in principal suites. Other important works of Australian woodcraft include the King table in the Reception Hall and display cases in the foyer exhibiting constitutional documents. We could continue enumerating at length for, wherever we look, we see work worthy of praise. To all those who worked to give us this home for our Parliament I express my sincere thanks. I hope that many Australians will have the opportunity to share our gratitude-and indeed excitement-when visiting this Parliament House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and the expression of thanks to the very many people who have contributed to this building. I agree with him and with you, Mr President, that it is very appropriate that representatives of the Parliaments, Governments and people who have made contribution to this place are here today to hear the expressions of thanks and the formal motion which will make them a part of our permanent Senate record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that there is some contention about this building, not least among the senators and members who will occupy it. I think it is an indication of the conservative nature of human beings that so many of us are finding it difficult to fit in to our new and very splendid environment. I have absolutely no doubt that those who have contributed the various items that have been referred to by the Leader of the Government hope that those items will inspire us to do our work in a fitting way for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed about the separation of Ministers from the back bench which is such a strong feature of the design of this building. However, that separation may lead legislators in this place to be more conscious of their role as legislators. I note that already some retired public servants have written about the possible uses of the new committee rooms and the change that that might induce. It may well be that the form of Parliament House will have a significant impact on the way in which this Parliament operates. With respect to all of those who have been thanked, I can say on behalf of the Opposition that we support the sentiments which have been expressed by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think, however, that it is also fitting to note that, in the construction of this place, the very enormous cost was considerably expanded by the very frequent and absurd restrictive work practices which afflicted the building site. The group which was omitted from the motion of thanks was the Opposition's waste watch committee, the rorts task force, which incurred considerable unpopularity in drawing attention to some of the quite extraordinarily wasteful things which occurred on this site. I remind the Senate, as we pass this motion of thanks, that this very expensive building was rendered far more expensive by some of the extraordinary practices which were carried on in this place, unfortunately in common with other commercial building sites in this country. We found, when examining this matter, that people were reluctant to talk about what was happening because they were frightened of reprisals. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that as this building was being built people were being paid a specific allowance just to show up at work; that nicking off-that practice of arriving at work and not actually staying to do a day's work-was common; that there were endless health and safety strikes which were extremely wasteful; and that a climbing time of two hours was allowed for crane drivers who took about 45 seconds actually to climb the cranes in question. I know that that list could be extended very considerably: I refer to the clothing allowance which was paid no matter how little time was spent on the site, to the excessive site allowances, and to the extraordinary range of strikes which were so damaging to many of the contractors who worked here. </PARA>

In what is a most splendid building, full of the most splendid objects and artefacts, I express that one element of regret: it was made so much more expensive for the people of Australia than otherwise would have been required. In all other respects, I heartily join in the sentiments which have been expressed by Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I associate the Australian Democrats with the motion of appreciation moved by Senator Button in regard to those countries, States and organisations which presented gifts to the new Parliament House. Senator Button has already referred to many of those gifts. Certainly, the antique maps and aluminium sculptures, the trees and the tapestries, the chairs and Chinese lanterns, the crystal glasses and candelabra, the teak benches, bronze busts, books on young Australians, stone lions and porcelain figures-to say nothing of clocks and wall hangings of every kind-will adorn the new Parliament House and its environs thanks to the generosity of the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many countries of very different political systems and ideologies, as well as Australian States and national organisations, have presented the Parliament with a wonderful array of exotic and beautiful gifts. It is particularly appropriate that we share the chamber today with representatives of many of the countries that have donated those gifts. The President's chair, the Hansard tables, coats of arms, a distinguished visitors chair, paintings, sundials and drinking fountains, the vice-regal chair in the Senate and dinner services and furniture for special rooms will become priceless possessions of those of us who work here and those who will follow us. Essentially, these gifts ensure that we want for nothing as far as decorations, accoutrements and creature comforts are concerned. They combine with the mosaic, the tapestry, the parquetry and so on produced by Australian artisans and artists to make this building truly unique and something that Australians can view and visit with pride. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this motion I echo the Governor-General's inauguration address by wishing us all well in this place of business and expressing the hope that the august and impressive surroundings which make up our permanent Parliament House lead us and our successors to draft and debate legislation in a true spirit of goodwill and concern for the well-being of the nation in the long term rather than our own short term political gains. </PARA>

<PARA> (a), (b) and (c) The Defence Service Homes loan is available to members of the Defence Force who complete more than six years service, and consequently no-one has been disadvantaged by the lack of announcement of the form of housing assistance to apply to those who have joined the Defence Force since May 1985. These members have access to the same in-Service housing assistance programs as have members of longer standing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question, based on the advice of Telecom Australia, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Telecom does keep sales check figures but not on a national basis. Sales check activities are the responsibility of decentralised Telecom district administrations and are not reported above this level. It is not possible to obtain these figures without diverting significant resources to a special investigation and this could not be justified.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Major activities aimed at improving the accuracy of Telecom's rental charges include:</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of automated systems which will reduce transcription errors and verify the accuracy of existing records on conversion from manual to automated systems;</PARA>
<PARA> revision of the Customer Services staff selection and accreditation processes;</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of new training programs to better equip and recruit staff for Customer Services work; and</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of automated text retrieval systems to facilitate more timely pricing advice to Customer Services staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Telecom proposes to discontinue routine sales checks for business customers.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past, Telecom's billing system could not provide a breakdown of rental for equipment installed on telephone services. However, Telecom did physically inspect equipment at business customers' premises from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> The new billing system being introduced nationally provides information on screen to enable prompt responses to business customers enquiring about charges for their equipment. Customers can also receive details of their equipment charges in regular or ad-hoc statements.</PARA>
<PARA> Inspections will still be performed where such action is warranted and is sought by the customer, and where normal billing procedures indicate some discrepancy.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The initiatives outlined in the three year Access and Equity Plan (1987-1990) are expected to be achieved within the ongoing sub-program allocations for the Department. There are a number of projects being undertaken which impact significantly on the access and equity strategies. However, these do not have specific allocations. The projects are aimed at improving client services and decision-making through the development of decision support systems, improving communication of policy and multiskilling of staff; and improving client access to services. Current budget allocations by sub-program for the Department are published in the Department's Portfolio Explanatory Notes, pages 79-80.</PARA>

However, the recently published Corporate Plan for 1987-88 identifies the Department's goals, strategies and outcomes, some of which relate to access and equity. While the statements in the Corporate Plan are at a high general level, more specific goals, strategies and outcomes have been developed for inclusion in regional work plans. These will be used to further refine the general performance indicators which have already been developed for sub-programs administered by the Portfolio. Details of these indicators, together with program statements are to be included in the 1988-89 Departmental Explanatory Notes.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government has considered permitting its representatives to testify before United States Congressional Committees but has concluded that there is no reason to depart from its present practice of dealing directly with individual members of committees and their staffs.</PARA>
<PARA> The rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States Congress do not preclude representatives of foreign governments testifying before a committee of the Congress. The issue of testimony by foreigners is decided by individual committee chairpersons and the practice varies between committees. On the whole, however, testimony by foreigners is unusual.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the doubtful utility of giving testimony, given the accessibility of committee members and their staffs to oral and written representations, an important contributing factor is whether Australian ministers or officials should place themselves under the jurisdiction of a foreign parliamentary body. I understand that this question also makes members of the Congress reluctant to ask for or agree to testimony by foreigners.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The figures quoted were given as at 17 December 1987. Three of the amendments have now been made. My colleague Mr Punch has written to the Committee regarding all of the undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Senate Standing Committee frequently writes to the Minister responsible for the ACT about Ordinances recently tabled. ACT Ordinances are numerous and cover a wide range of community activities, essentially the same as those regulated by Acts, Regulations and By-laws in the States. This type of legislation frequently deals with matters which relate to the Committee's interests or concerns. Accordingly, the number of recent ministerial undertakings to the Committee relating to ACT matters is not, of itself alone, a particular cause for concern. I have, however, directed my Department to ensure that, once an undertaking of general application is given, it will be applied in the making of relevant legislation in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Mr Punch has recently written to the Committee concerning arrangements for implementing ministerial undertakings given to the Committee. I do not wish to pre-empt the Committee's consideration of that letter. In respect of the projects awaiting drafting, see answer (4).</PARA>

The amendments will meet the requirements of the Rome Convention for performers' protection.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Reserve Bank currently measures the capital adequacy of banks using the simple ``capital-to-total assets'' ratio. Banks generally operate with capital ratios above 6 per cent measured on that basis. In the light of changes in the character of banking, in Australia and overseas countries, the Reserve Bank has been developing a new approach to the measurement of capital adequacy to take better account of the risk profile of a bank's business, including off-balance sheet activities. The Bank outlined its proposed risk ratio approach to the measurement of capital adequacy in a discussion paper circulated to banks in January 1988. At this stage no decision has been made about specific capital ratio standards under the proposed risk ratio framework. However, the Bank has given its endorsement to a proposal by the Basle Supervisors' Committee, based in the Bank for International Settlements, suggesting the adoption of a minimum standard ratio of ``Capital to weighted risk assets'' of 8 per cent as a basis for international convergence of capital standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Under the proposed new capital adequacy framework, bank loans to private sector clients will generally be measured at their gross values and receive a 100 per cent weight. The proposed 50 per cent weight for owner-occupied housing fully secured against mortgages should work towards lower capital costs to banks in providing housing loans.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) In April this year a high level committee of CSIRO scientists met to examine ways to attract high calibre scientists, especially expatriate scientists, to Australia in general and CSIRO in particular. The committee has not yet concluded its deliberations but there is emerging generally the view that, while the low salaries of scientists in Australia militates against ready recruitment, major factors are related to working conditions and lifestyle. A major requirement for attracting and holding high quality younger scientists in Australia is the provision of `core funding' for research, at a level that enables them to be provided with the resources to undertake substantial longer term research work. The recently implemented restructuring of CSIRO and the accompanying greater autonomy of the research institutes will also allow greater flexibility and the wider use of attractive extra-salary elements such as consultancies, directorships, joint appointments (e.g. with industry, universities).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A major consequence of programs of Government departments such as Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Employment, Education and Training is the expansion of current job prospects by the creation of opportunities for scientists and engineers in Australian industry. Programs include the R and D taxation concession, GIRD scheme, teaching companies scheme, national industry extension services scheme, management and investment companies, the offsets program, and the registration of research agencies. There are also more focused schemes such as the national space program, computer hardware and software assistance, and the heavy engineering assistance scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Government and non-Government agencies alike are now more active than they used to be in promoting the excitement of science and the rewards of a scientific career. CSIRO has a number of programs aimed at stimulating the interest of young people in science. Some examples are: CSIRO science education centres (in conjunction with States), the Double Helix Club, the women in science program, the Scifile current awareness booklet, laboratory open days and participation in Expo 88 and in the travelling Bicentennial Exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In the March-April 1988 edition of Search (the edition referred to in the question) Dr Glenn Pure of the Science and Technology Policy Branch of DITAC reports `a clear and consistent net influx of scientists and engineers into Australia, essentially in all disciplines, over the past 4 financial years'. Dr Pure refers to the Occupational Share System for Skilled Migration and its uses in areas where shortages do currently exist such as electronic engineering, computing and production engineering. He comments also on the role of the education system in ensuring the provision of people with science and engineering skills. The Government's current review of higher education funding has this as one of its broad objectives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 May 1988 (Hansard, page 2514), Senator Vallentine asked me a question about the transport of spent fuel from the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to the United States. I now have more information on the contract cost, the destination of the spent fuel and safety measures at that destination. The answers to those parts of the honourable senator's question are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The costs of transporting and reprocessing the spent fuel elements will be about $A3 million. The value of the recovered uranium and of the special transport cask (which is owned by ANSTO and will save leasing fees for future shipments) is about $A2.5 million. The net cost of the operation is therefore expected to be about $A0.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Evans, answered similar questions from the honourable senator on 6 May and 26 November 1986 and made it clear that the spent fuel would not be reprocessed at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington, contrary to Senator Vallentine's assertions. In accordance with the reprocessing contract with the US Department of Energy, the spent fuel will be delivered to either the Idaho Falls Chemical Reprocessing Plant, Idaho, or to the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. The final decision on the facility used is at the discretion of the USDOE. All relevant safety guidelines will be observed whichever of the two is chosen.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to allegations about safety at Hanford, I am informed that the January-February 1988 edition of `Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' discusses radioactive contamination during the first 20 years of operation of this establishment, which commenced operations in the 1940s. Much of the reported radioactive contamination arises from those early years when environmental protection standards were less stringent. The US Department of Energy has closed down many of the facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate, the spent fuel from Lucas Heights will be shipped in accordance with all US and Australian safety requirements, will be subject to stringent nuclear safeguards and will remain solely for peaceful use.</PARA>

<PARA> On the 16 May 1988 the Chairman of the Industry Research and Development Board, Mr Bill Kricker, issued a Press release announcing 10 discretionary grants for research and development by Australian companies. Is the Minister aware that one such grant of nearly half a million dollars was awarded to Rib Loc (Australia) Pty Ltd of South Australia to design and develop a pipeline renovation system. Is the Minister further aware that another Australian company, Danby Pty Ltd of Queensland, already operates successfully in this field and owns patents which cover the type of renovation envisaged by the half million dollar grant? Can the Minister explain why such duplication has occurred and what mechanism the Industry Research and Development Board uses to review its own decisions, particularly as Danby Pty Ltd received grants from the Board in 1985 and 1986 for the development of its system of pipeline renovation.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Decisions on discretionary grants are made by the Industry Research &amp; Development Board. I have been informed by the Board that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The arrangements under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement establish a predictable environment in which industries in both countries can take investment and planning decisions having regard to the wider trans-Tasman market.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the CER Agreement represents only one aspect of the Australian Government's broader efforts to encourage internationally competitive industries. It is a matter for individual enterprises to pursue opportunities within the Australia-New Zealand market in line with commercial judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent discussions regarding a possible merger between Qantas, Australian Airlines and Air New Zealand were explanatory only and took place against the background of a rapidly changing world aviation scene, which is putting at risk the viability of national carriers operating in traditionally independent ways, and has forced airlines all around the world to cope with the challenges posed by the mega-carriers and the new competitive realities. There was however no agreement to merge the airlines, as several difficulties, such as the structural imbalance the merger would necessarily involve between Australian and New Zealand interests, were too formidable to justify it being pursued further at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this, the discussions demonstrated that common booking arrangements between Qantas and Air New Zealand, and joint marketing and joint purchasing would benefit both airlines through lower costs and efficiency gains. A close commercial alliance would also give the two airlines much greater bargaining capacity both with other countries and the mega-carriers.</PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealand Government is currently considering preliminary bids, by a number of interests, including Qantas, following approaches made by that Government inviting non-binding bids for the purchase of equity in Air New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At the meeting between Australian and New Zealand Ministers on the Review of the Australia- New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement held in Christchurch on 20-21 June 1988 it was agreed that from 1 July 1990 when full free trade between the two countries is achieved, anti-dumping measures would no longer be applied in respect of goods originating in either member state, subject to the necessary amendments in both countries' competition laws.</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments relate, inter alia, to misuse of market power or dominance where the conduct occurs in the other country and to extend the definition of market to apply to any market, not just the Australian or New Zealand markets.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Deputy Prime Ministers of both countries signed on 1 July 1988 a Memorandum of Understanding on Harmonisation of Business Law which establishes a program for consideration of harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand legislation in a number of areas including:</PARA>
<PARA> consumer protection, particularly with respect to post-sale consumer protection, and consumer credit laws;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Government has made the ABC FM stereo service available throughout Australia via the package of ABC services carried on the satellite. The Department of Transport and Communications is implementing a program to extend the terrestrial transmission of the ABC FM Stereo Service to various major population centres across the country.</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of transmission facilities for ABC FM stereo radio commenced in 1976; the network has progressively expanded under the first phase of the program to its current total of 39 transmitting stations. As funding and spectrum availability permits, a second phase of the program will introduce in-fill translators to service significant areas of deficient reception within the general coverage areas of existing main transmitters.</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a further six (6) main transmitting stations is planned under the first phase of the program, but installation is being delayed because FM channel availability is being restricted by the presence of television stations using channels 3, 4 and 5 which overlap the frequency spectrum needed for FM radio. Transfer of these television stations to other channels is required before the additional ABC FM stereo stations can be established.</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1986, my predecessor announced a timetable for the clearance of certain television transmissions from the spectrum required for the FM radio. The program for the installation of the additional ABC FM stereo transmitters is tied to this timetable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Three high powered ABC FM stereo transmitters are planned to provide ABC FM coverage of the northern region of NSW, and they are presently expected to be constructed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Upper Namoi (Mount Dowe)-1989-90</PARA>
<PARA> Grafton/Kempsey (Mount Moombil)-1990-91</PARA>
<PARA> Richmond/Tweed area-1990-91</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the difficult terrain in parts of the region, there will inevitably be areas that will not receive an adequate service from these new transmitters. Armidale is one such area, but it will receive an ABC FM stereo translator at the same time as the Upper Namoi transmitter is constructed. Other similar areas will be addressed as funding permits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australia's migration processing procedures ensure that all migrants and refugees settling in Australia are medically screened prior to migration. Those found to be suffering from diseases such as tuberculosis are refused admission or, if their compassionate or humanitarian claims upon Australia are very strong, rendered non-infective and granted an entry visa on an undertaking to report to health authorities after arrival for monitoring and follow up treatment.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent legislation referred to in the Melbourne Herald of 29 April 1988 does not affect the requirement for pre-arrival medical screening of all intending migrants. The article referred to the Victorian health authorities' own discretionary arrangements to re-screen some categories of migrants and refugees after arrival. Arrangements are now in place for State health authorities to access immigrants' arrival details, facilitating re-screening at the authorities' discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Other than citizens of New Zealand travelling on New Zealand passports who require no prior authority to enter Australia under the Trans Tasman travel arrangement, all migrants and refugees will continue to undergo detailed pre-departure medical screening and clearance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The International Whaling Commission (IWC) agreed in 1982 to a moratorium on all commercial whaling to begin in 1986. However Article VIII of the Convention under which the IWC operates makes provision for countries to take whales under special permit for research purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> In March 1987, Japan submitted a proposal to the IWC for an annual take of 875 Antarctic whales (i.e. 825 Minke and 50 Sperm) under special research permits for at least the next 12 years. At the Annual Meeting of the IWC in June 1987 a resolution was passed recommending that Japan refrain from issuing such permits until the IWC Scientific Committee was able to resolve serious uncertainties identified in the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> Japan then submitted a new proposal for a kill of 300 minke whales in the 1987/88 whaling season. At an extraordinary meeting of the IWC's scientific Committee set up to review Japan's proposal there was strong opposition from the majority of scientists present. Subsequently the U.K. proposed, and Australia and Sweden seconded, a resolution recommending that Japan refrain from taking the whales. It was adopted by a majority of 19 for, 6 against and 2 abstentions (6 countries failed to vote). Despite this resolution Japan ordered its whaling vessels to Antarctica where they took 273 of the planned 300 whales in early 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The United States has two legislative provisions for economic sanctions against countries `diminishing the effectiveness of the IWC'. The Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act provides for restriction of fishing allocations in the U.S.A. 200 mile fishing zone. The Pelly Amendment to the U.S. Fishermen's Protective Act provides for the prohibition of fisheries imports from offending countries. Certification of a country as `diminishing the effectiveness of the IWC' precedes consideration of sanctions against such countries.</PARA>
<PARA> At the last session of the IWC (Bournemouth U.K., 1987), Australia worked closely with the U.S.A. to establish specific criteria for the issuance of special permits under Article VIII of the Convention. The successful adoption of these specific criteria by the IWC has now provided the U.S.A. with a clear basis upon which to certify and sanction, under the Packwood-Magnuson and Pelly amendments, nations such as Japan, whose scientific research programs do not meet the criteria set down.</PARA>
<PARA> The U.S.A. certified Japan on 10 February 1988 and later announced that Japanese access to U.S.A. waters in 1988 (involving catches of 3000 tons of sea snails and 5000 tons of whiting) will be denied. All future Japanese fishing privileges will be denied until the situation is corrected. The U.S.A. decided not to restrict fisheries imports from Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has no legislation similar to that used by the United States to impose sanctions on Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia considers the IWC to be the appropriate body for the international control of all whaling and the appropriate agency through which Australia should pursue international cooperation for the protection and conservation of all whales. Australia is an active member of the IWC and strongly supports the work of Australian scientists in the IWC Scientific Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 25 March 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the formation by the Northern Land Council of a commercial arm called the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation Pty Ltd which involves unfair trade practices.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Northern Land Council (N.L.C.) a statutory authority to process exploration and mining proposals on behalf of the traditional Aboriginal landowners.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the N.L.C. prohibited from competing with exploration and mining industries but is its new company actively interfering from a favoured position; if so, is this a blatant conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Will the Minister take action to remove the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation Pty Ltd from this area as instead of allowing the N.L.C. to act as an honest broker it has turned the N.L.C. into an aggressive competitor with unfair access to detailed confidential commercial and geological information without itself lifting a finger.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Are the two organisations not at arm's length because they have the same directors and the same address and the Investment Corporation enters into Joint Ventures but refuses to name the companies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the existence of the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation (N.A.I.C.).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The N.L.C. may not itself engage in exploration or mining activity but a properly established Aboriginal organisation may do so if it has the consent of the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy to negotiate with the Land Council. I understand that N.A.I.C. has not yet obtained the required consent. The question of conflict of interest is therefore hypothetical.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The company may not negotiate with the Land Council for an exploration licence without the consent of the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy. Therefore the matter is one for him to determine.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am informed that the two organisations do not have the same Directors. I am not aware of any Joint Ventures that the company has entered into. If they do exist they may not necessarily relate to mining on Aboriginal land.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I understand from recent press reports that the Queensland Government has decided to call for new tenders for the redevelopment of this site.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The National Trust has nominated all three buildings for registration on the Australian Heritage Commission's Register of the National Estate. The Commission intends to proceed with the gazettal of Greyscourt and Plough Inn at the next available opportunity scheduled for October 1988. By that time it is also expected that the Commission will have made a registration decision on the Allgas Building. Registration imposes constraints only on the actions of Commonwealth Ministers and authorities. Registration is not directed at the actions of State or Local Government or private owners and institutions. At this stage it does not appear likely that a Commonwealth Minister or authority will be involved in the future use of the Expo site or these buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government will not give an undertaking to assist in funding to protect these buildings. I consider this to be primarily a matter for the Queensland Government.

<PARA> (1) New plant varieties developed using genetic engineering are eligible for Plant Variety Rights (PVR) if they are distinct, uniform, stable (DUS criteria) and new.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1988 (Hansard, page 2172), Senator Sanders asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, questions without notice arising from correspondence relating to the relabelling of South African uranium to get around Finnish and Soviet embargoes. This correspondence was provided to Senator Sanders by Jup Weber, a Greens member of the Luxembourg Parliament. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In my statement to the Parliament on 20 April I outlined the conditions under which the Australian/Euratom Agreement permits safeguards obligations to be exchanged within the jurisdiction of the European Communities. I would further note that an exchange of safeguards obligations within Europe can only be achieved with the approval of the EURATOM Safeguards Directorate (ESD) after application by the relevant organisation concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is certainly not a fact that exchanges of safeguards obligations in the European Communities are privatised and unregulated. The approval of the ESD is necessary before any obligation exchange can take place. The ESD is of course an official agency of the European Commission. It is the authority which regulates movements of, and exchanges of obligations on, nuclear material. The prior consent of Australia for exchanges of safeguards obligations within EURATOM is not required provided certain conditions, set out in my statement of 20 April, are adhered to;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Internal exchanges of safeguards obligations involving Australian obligated nuclear material do not alter the amount of nuclear material subject to Australian bilateral safeguards agreements. Neither do they affect the total amount of nuclear material which remains within the control of a bilateral partner country or group of countries.</PARA>
<PARA> International flag swaps (IFS) however have the same effect as a physical transfer of nuclear material from one safeguards jurisdiction to another. Under Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements no Australian obligated nuclear material can be re-transferred from a bilateral partner's safeguards jurisdiction without Australia's prior consent. Therefore any IFS involving Australian obligated nuclear material would also require Australia's prior consent.</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons IFS are different from internal exchanges of safeguards obligations and require a different set of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australian safeguards agreements do not ban exchanges of safeguards obligations on equivalent quantities of nuclear material within a jurisdiction. Their design and implementation have been successful in ensuring that obligated nuclear material subject to these agreements remains in exclusively peaceful non-explosive use.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 May 1988 (Hansard, page 2513), Senator Powell asked me a question without notice concerning a document about a large number of community youth support scheme (CYSS) projects in Victoria. I undertook to provide some information additional to my answer. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following information for the honourable senator:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of the 1987/88 Budget, the Government announced its intention to integrate the three existing community programs-the Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS), the Community Training Program (CTP) and the Community Volunteer Program (CVP)-into a single community training and employment assistance program. On 15 June 1988, the Minister for Employment and Education Services, Mr Duncan, announced details of the new program, to be called SkillShare. Members of Parliament and Senators have been supplied with detailed information packages about SkillShare.</PARA>
<PARA> The document referred to by Senator Powell is part of a preliminary examination of information about existing programs undertaken in the light of the impending introduction of SkillShare. However, it is a working document with no official status, and will not be used as the basis for any future funding decisions under the new program. Further, departmental officers were not under any direction to consider political issues during this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> SkillShare has been designed to meet the needs of disadvantaged unemployed people and the local labour market, and funding priority will be given to those projects which are best able to offer activities and structured skills training to accord with SkillShare's guidelines and its emphasis on meaningful outcomes for participants. Distribution of funds will be dependent on local levels of unemployment and the needs of the local labour market, as well as the capacity of prospective sponsors to meet program objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> Prospective project sponsors will be invited to apply for funding in July. No decision has been taken on the continuation or otherwise of existing projects, which will be funded under current arrangements until 31 December 1988, and all applications for funding will be considered without prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA> Members and senators will be kept informed of the situation in relation to approval of projects in their electorates.</PARA>
