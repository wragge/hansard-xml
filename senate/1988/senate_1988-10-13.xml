<PARA> That your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them, for cost saving reasons only, on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra Bureaucrat, and:</PARA>
<PARA> That we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>

<TITLE>In-vitro Fertilisation Patients: Medicare Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes a variety of amendments to Acts dealing with defence matters. The more important amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>a. provide the government with proper legal control over claims for salvage by crews of naval ships. </PARA>
<PARA>b. decriminalise the wearing of items of defence force uniforms by members of the public while retaining a prohibition on the wearing of defence force emblems and other insignia. </PARA>
<PARA>c. enable the defence administration to require an officer of the defence force who is promoted to the rank of colonel or equivalent or higher rank to render at least one year's service in the rank before resigning. </PARA>
<PARA>d. remove the upper limit on the amount of reparations that a court martial or defence force magistrate may order a convicted offender to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>e. enable certain officers of defence small arms factories to be exempted from State and Territory firearms licensing laws when carrying small arms for official purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments:</PARA>
<PARA>a. make various amendments of defence force retirement and death benefits legislation to take account of recent improvements to superannuation legislation and to remove certain possible ambiguities; and</PARA>
<PARA>b. put the existing appointment of the Vice- chief of the Defence Force upon a statutory basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I will explain the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Salvage Claims</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to amend The Defence Act 1903 to clarify the power of the Government to control the exercise by the crew of HMA ships of their right to claim salvage for the salvage of property at sea, and to put on a proper legal basis the administrative arrangements that are followed when the crew of a warship exercises that right. I should point out that the Bill is not concerned with military salvage-that is, the capture of property at sea from the enemy in time of war-which is governed by what is known as `prize law'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the successful salvage of property on the high seas, the right of the salvor to reward has been recognised by maritime law from ancient times. The requirement that the owners of the ship and cargo pay salvage to the salvors is a recognition of the effort by the salvor and of the direct benefit conferred on the owners. It is also based on a just regard for the general interests of ships and maritime commerce. The right to claim salvage vests in the owners of a salving vessel and in the crew of that vessel. The greater share of the reward goes to the owners, whose vessel was put at risk. In the case of a crown vessel, manned by employees of the Crown, entitlement of a member of the crew to claim salvage generally arises if the services rendered are outside the scope of his ordinary duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Warships have real, if undefined, duties stemming from their function of policing the high seas. The law has accordingly implied a high scope for public duty in the case of warships but has nevertheless accepted that it is proper for the crew to claim salvage where the service has been one of an important character. While a very high duty would be expected where the saving of lives is concerned, the crews of warships could not be expected, as part of their duties, to run the same high risks where the salvage of property is concerned. In practice, claims for salvage by crews of HMA ships are infrequent, for two reasons. Firstly, commanding officers are instructed not to undertake salvage if any suitable merchant ship is available. Secondly, the making of claims is discouraged where the service is not regarded as being of an important character. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent cases in which claims by Australian naval crews proceeded were the salvage in 1955 of the Swedish ship Pacific Clipper by HMA ships Murchison and Shoalhaven and the salvage in 1972 of the Hong Kong ship Kai Wing by HMAS Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that, when one of HMA ships renders salvage services to a vessel in circumstances that give the crew of the naval ship an entitlement to claim salvage from the owners of the salved vessel, the following rules will apply:</PARA>
<PARA>a. the right of the crew of a naval ship to pursue a claim for salvage to be subject to the consent of the chief of naval staff;</PARA>
<PARA>b. the Commanding Officer to be empowered to act on behalf of the crew in the pursuit and settlement of salvage claims; and</PARA>
<PARA>c. the distribution of the crew's share to be apportioned according to a prescribed scale, with provision for recognition of specially meritorious service. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the rules are as follows, respectively:</PARA>
<PARA>a. because warships have the kinds of duties I have described, it is desirable that there be a legally based power to restrict claims to those where the service has been of an important character. </PARA>
<PARA>b. It would be an excessive administrative burden if the Australian Government Solicitor prosecuting the claim had to be authorised individually by all the sailors involved in a claim and were required to deal with each sailor separately. </PARA>
<PARA>c. The setting by law of fixed shares for each class of member relieves the arbitrator of the difficult task of apportioning the reward between the sailors involved. </PARA>
<PARA>Rules of this kind are not necessary in the case of salvage services provided by merchant ships, because the crews are much smaller and, in any case, may belong to unions who can press claims on behalf of their members. </PARA>
<PARA> The government did consider whether the right of the commanding officer and crew of HMA ships to claim salvage reward might be abolished, on the ground that members of the Navy have a duty to perform for which they are adequately recompensed. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this, it is a fact that salvage at sea remains a difficult, hazardous and uncertain operation and encouragement to persons to assist in successfully salvaging an endangered vessel should be continued. As to the question of duty, it has been indicated already that this is of limited extent where property only is concerned. Members of the Navy are not trained salvors and the design of naval ships makes them ill-suited to salvage work. Furthermore, it would be inequitable to deny the right of salvage to members of the Navy while retaining that right for merchant seamen employed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Wearing of Defence Force Uniforms and Emblems</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Section 83 of the Defence Act creates offences relating to the use and wearing by unauthorised persons of Defence Force uniforms, emblems, flags, et cetera, and their supply and manufacture. The section attempts to cover both peace and war situations. It extends to the forces of Commonwealth countries and, in time of war or defence emergency, to forces of allied countries and to other uniforms, emblems or flags specified by the Minister. So far as Defence Force uniforms are concerned, the offence of wearing such uniforms without authority is, in peacetime, widely disregarded. This is not surprising since the Commonwealth itself facilitates this breach of the law by selling surplus Defence Force uniforms to disposals retailers for sale to the public. This Dickensian situation has been the subject of comment in the press and of representations to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill accordingly proposes to decriminalise the wearing of defence force uniforms while retaining the offences of wearing Defence Force emblems, badges, et cetera. Since the controls necessary in peace and war are so different, the dual role of section 83 is unsatisfactory. The Bill therefore deletes the wartime offences and all reference to foreign forces etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Restriction on Resignations of Senior Officers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> When an officer of the defence force who has not less than 20 years effective service resigns, he is entitled to a pension calculated in relation to the annual rate of pay applicable to him immediately before his resignation. If such an officer resigns shortly after his promotion, he is entitled to pension calculated by reference to the salary applicable to the higher rate, notwithstanding that he had provided the Commonwealth with very little service in the higher rank. Such resignations also cause significant disturbance to staffing arrangements particularly when the promotion has been made in conjunction with posting the other officer concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to amend the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910 relating to officers' resignations so that the relevant chief of staff may reject such a resignation if tendered to take effect before 12 months has elapsed since the date of promotion to the rank of colonel or equivalent or higher rank. A similar amendment will be made for the Air Force by statutory rules amending the Air Force Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Reparation Orders</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 empowers Service tribunals to order a convicted person to pay reparations to a person who has sustained loss or damage through the offence that was committed, up to a limit of five times the maximum amount of fine that could have been imposed. No such limit applies to ordinary criminal courts. The limit on Service tribunals was imposed because of doubt whether Service tribunals should be concerned with reparations involving substantial sums. </PARA>
<PARA> One consequence of the present limit is that where substantial reparations should be ordered it is necessary for there to be the cost, and delay, of a separate civil court action. It also means that the Service tribunal cannot, in sentencing the person, take into consideration the amount of reparations that the offender will be required to make. Finally, it seems inconsistent that a general court martial may impose life imprisonment but is subject to limits as to the amount of a reparation order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to remove the limit on the amount of reparations that may be ordered by a court martial or Defence Force magistrate but retain the present limits on summary authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments made by sections 10 and 42 regarding officers' resignations will ensure that a minimum of 12 months' service will be rendered by senior officers after promotion. This will result in deferring for a period the commencement of payment of pension to the officers concerned but no figure could reasonably be estimated of the saving to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment made by section 22 is expected to eliminate the institution of civil court proceedings to recover the balance of the loss or damage suffered by the Commonwealth in cases where the loss or damage exceeded the amount that the offender could have been ordered, by a court martial or Defence Force magistrate, to pay, in a case where recovery of the amount so ordered is appropriate. No figure could reasonably be estimated of the saving to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment made by section 25 to ensure that the provisions relating to the transition from the DFRB scheme (1948) to the DFRDB scheme (1973) do not operate with regard to re-entered recipient members will prevent the payment of additional unintended benefits to pensioners but no figure could reasonably be estimated of the saving to the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It follows Senator Boswell's question asked last Tuesday concerning moves by Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) Board members against the Chairwoman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Mrs Shirley McPherson, and the General Manager, Mr Mick O'Brien. What was the basis of the Board's action in both cases? Is the Minister aware that ADC staff in Sydney yesterday walked out in protest against what they described as the apparent victimisation of Mrs McPherson and Mr O'Brien and that staff in Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Darwin passed motions criticising the actions of the board at its Adelaide meeting? Does this not indicate that the Government's hand picked board members-I remind the Minister that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs sacked the Board and replaced it just a few months ago-are out of touch with the activities of the Commission and the performance of both the persons concerned? Given that the Secretary to the Minister's Department is a member of the Board, did the Minister have prior knowledge of the attack on Mrs McPherson and Mr O'Brien? Will the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs agree to meet Commission staff, as requested at yesterday's Sydney meeting, to discuss this latest episode in the Government's gross mishandling of Aboriginal affairs policy? Will the Minister tell the Senate whether the Government retains confidence in Mrs McPherson as Chairwoman of the Development Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the basis of the Board's resolutions if they were carried in the terms which have been relayed to the Senate chamber in Question Time and that we have read about in the press. As I understand it the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, has written to the Chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Mrs Shirley McPherson, asking the Commission to advise him urgently as to the motions that were passed, rather than relying on press reports or questions asked in Question Time. The proper process would be for the Commission to make available the confirmed minutes of its meeting so that we can all be in a position to know exactly what resolutions were passed. I believe that is a correct and responsible attitude by the Minister in seeking that particular advice as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He also asked whether, if there were any other matters upon which the Commission wished to advise him, it would do so so that he, and I in turn, might be in a position to answer such questions as may properly be asked here in this chamber or in the Estimates committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I express some amazement that a matter which has received such wide publicity has not been the subject of some briefing from the Department. I suggest to the Minister that that is probably because he carries on in such a way that the Department is not aware of what he is doing. My supplementary question is: given these reports of the concerns that have been expressed by Aboriginal people, whom this Government in the past has been so prepared to claim to be the spokesperson for, will the Minister give the Senate a simple undertaking, a guarantee, that his Government will not put under pressure, will not bulldoze, those Aboriginal people who choose to express views which are contrary to the plans of the Minister for the drastic reorganisation of Aboriginal affairs?

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only Prime Minister of Australia, and the one who is likely to remain Prime Minister for a very long time yet. He referred to them in the context of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda and a move to a freer market in petroleum products. At the current point, prices for LPG are set by a formula which the Government adjusts every six months. It was last adjusted on 1 October. In March this year we released a discussion paper posing the possibility of a complete deregulation and a free market or a continuance of the same methods of price adjustments. We received 43 submissions from various organisations right across the broad spectrum of all parties interested in LPG. A number of backbenchers from all sides of the Parliament chose to support a number of those submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Monday this week Cabinet decided to move to a free market from 1 February next year by asking the Prices Surveillance Authority, from that date on, to determine the maximum wholesale price for LPG, with the Government at the same time not to renounce but to put on ice, in reserve, its export control powers-a move that it would review in 18 months' time. The reason for that second provision is, of course, to ensure that the local market is serviced-that supplies to the local market are maintained rather than our losing supplies to the export market.</PARA>
<PARA> This brings liquefied petroleum gas into the same regime, in terms of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as a number of other crude oil based products which were deregulated at the beginning of this year, following the move to the free market under the portfolio when it was held by Senator Gareth Evans. The Prices Surveillance Authority determines prices for a number of petroleum products, including gasoline, aviation gas and jet engine fuel. It is consistent with our move in deregulating the financial sector, with our liberalisation of foreign investment policy, and with the tax reform package we have put through this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that these steps will assist considerably, first of all, in encouraging further use of LPG. It is an underutilised fuel resource. It is particularly important as a developing energy source for transport. It is very important that, if that is to continue, its marketing be efficient and competitive. We believe that these steps will assist. It is important as well that as our crude oil resources run down over time the market, if I can put it in these terms, be liberated to ensure that LPG can pick up the slack that it can obviously take advantage of in such a position. We believe that the decision will provide a climate for better investment in LPG storage and distribution, particularly at seaport facilities for LPG. We believe it will give a greater incentive for LPG, particularly in the production of natural gas, to be syphoned off and used in terms of the market it serves both in transport and industry. As I say, it is a move towards a free market.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me how we would protect consumers. I believe that the consumers' interest is properly protected by the Prices Surveillance Authority exercising its powers and by the reserve powers and export controls being held for the period of 18 months, subject to review after that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Are reports in today's media correct in stating that the Minister is favourably considering proposals for excise reductions on Bass Strait oil production put to him yesterday at his meeting with Bass Strait producers Esso-BHP?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1332" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that I had a meeting yesterday with Esso-BHP, the partners that operate the platforms that exploit the oil reserves of Bass Strait. The meeting had been organised some time ago. One of the two main issues that we discussed-there were several others of a minor character compared with these-was the Piper Alpha tragedy in the North Sea and the remedial steps being taken in Australia to make sure that there is not a revisitation of those events on our 13 offshore platforms operating in Bass Strait. I appreciate the work that the partners have been putting into that matter, which is of considerable concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that we discussed was the highly volatile fluctuations in oil prices on the world market and the effect that has on the costs of production out of Bass Strait. I do not need to go into a long dissertation about the volatility of oil prices, but there has been a number of speculations about where the price will rest. The benchmark crudes are trading between about $11.35 and $13.40 at present, but there are overnight alterations in those prices. The Government is concerned not to respond to short term fluctuations but to observe the longer term trends in those prices and the longer term aspects of those price changes, if there are any, on production in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Esso-BHP put to me a position concerning reductions in excise that it wants the Government to consider. It is not appropriate-and, indeed, it is not Esso-BHP's wish-that I canvass in public the details of the position that was put, but I notice that the observation has been made in the press that any further shuttings in Bass Strait production would have a consequential effect on our balance of payments because of the importation of replacement oil from overseas, albeit at lower prices.</PARA>
<PARA> I notice the speculation of what the revenue implications might be for Budget if we were to respond by reducing excise to keep production going. In view of that speculation, the words `favourable consideration' that appear in the press are a misreporting. I did not indicate what degree of consideration I would give and I certainly did not indicate favourable consideration to the submissions made on that occasion. I said that the Government's position was to consider soberly and carefully the implications of all these things and that it was not a decision I would take in isolation; it was obviously a decision that would be taken in consultation with the Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> I also said that, in general terms, given the attention that has been paid by Senators Walsh and Evans-my predecessors with responsibility in this portfolio-to the tax regime on crude oil production in Australia, I believed that we, as a government, had got our tax regime right. It is important, from the point of view of industry, to send long and strong signals to industry as to the framework for a tax regime. Overnight alterations or chopping and changing alterations to a tax structure such as that are not appropriate. With recognition of the volatility of prices we will consider the representations made. It is an absolute misstatement to say that that is favourable to the particular representations in this case. There is no doubt that the Government is concerned about the price and will consider those overtures in a proper, rational and logical manner.</PARA>

If he does, what steps is the Government taking to offset these adverse consequences? In particular, what is the Government doing to follow Japan's example of setting up joint ventures with some of the 12 countries currently belonging to the European Community?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see that Senator Chaney is back too. I will have a further look at the latter part of the question about implications of the 1992 single market for rural producers and seek to give Senator Haines a better general answer. As to the general question, obviously the developments in Europe have potentially quite profound implications-positive as well as potentially adverse-for Australia after 1992. The European Single Act of 1987 commits the European Community to the aim of establishing a single market progressively over a period expiring on 31 December. It is important to appreciate the progressive character of these moves. It will not happen overnight in 1992. It is beginning to happen right now, and we have to formulate responses to it right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The European Economic Community (EEC) was formed in 1958. The single market does not represent the creation of a new free trade area or customs union. What it does entail is a program for the adoption of a whole number of measures, some 300 in fact, for the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services between the member states within the EEC. Certainly the Commission and many member states have declared that they do not intend to create a Fortress Europe, and that very strong assertion was made to me just an hour ago this morning by the EC Commissioner, Peter Sutherland, who is specifically responsible for competition policy and who is in Australia at the moment. What the EC is saying is that that is not its intention but that reciprocity may be sought, where appropriate, from third countries for any trade liberalisation. The Community is yet to define reciprocity, which would, of course, need to be consistent with its existing and future international commitments, including those which we hope would be negotiated in the services area in the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of what we are doing about exploring possible implications of all this for Australia, all I can really say at this stage is that officials are currently undertaking detailed assessments of the bilateral and multilateral trade and economic implications for Australia, not only of the impending events in Europe but also, of course, in the context of the issues that are now very much on the table about the relationship between all three major economic powers-the EC, North America and Japan-and the reactions that the rest of the world may need to develop in response to that emerging situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Specifically on the subject of joint ventures, about which the honourable senator asked, there is at least one such area that I am able to advise that progress is being made on, and that is in the context of Italy. An Australia-Italy joint working group mandate exists, which includes exploration between business counterparts of the possibility of joint ventures. The next meeting of that group is expected to be held early next year in Italy. It will include investment and marketing seminars, and discussions are currently being held with Italian officials on the timing and scope of the next meeting. If I am able to add anything further to that part of the question, after having had a further look at it and a bit more notice, I will be happy to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. There has obviously been some care to try to bring this question within the Standing Orders, but the basis of the question is whether there were grounds for dismissal of a local government authority. We have just gone through a referendum about this, and I think it is quite understood, even in this chamber, that local government is not a matter of Commonwealth responsibility. Local government works within the States and it is a State matter that this question fundamentally relates to. The mere attachment of some reference to the fact that some Commonwealth funds are paid to the shire council certainly does not bring it within the province, the obligations or the duty of this Minister to pass judgments on the fitness of the council to carry on under Queensland law. I would respectfully submit that this question is clearly out of order.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am interested in Senator Chaney's comments about local government being a State matter and I am wondering whether that foreshadows a particular attitude in the Opposition in relation to funding of local government. Nevertheless, the question which Senator Colston asks me certainly does fall into my area of responsibility, so much so that the State Minister, Jim Randell, wrote to me recently about precisely this matter. He has made the decision to sack the Burke Shire Council on the grounds that it was not able to manage its deficit and he then asked me, as Minister at the Federal level, to provide additional revenue as a rescue operation for that particular council. I can see Senator Walsh looking extremely concerned about that as a precedent, and I am sure Senator Stone on a rare occasion would agree with me that there is absolutely no way that the Federal Government can be in the business of providing rescue funds to councils that have got themselves into difficulty. It is a State responsibility to have seen that this council received assistance, not last year or the year before, but right back in 1981 when a deficit was first exhibited in the council's budget. That is when the State Government should have taken action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I come to the point of Senator Colston's question: will the Federal Government continue to provide financial assistance grants to the Burke Shire? Yes, we will continue to provide those grants because they are to the people of that area.</PARA>
<PARA> I certainly will make a comment, if I may, about my attitude to the sacking of democratically elected councils. I have no doubt at all that the Burke Shire Council needs some administrative assistance and that an administrator could have worked with the elected council to resolve the problem of this deficit, but the Federal Government will continue to support the people of Burke Shire.</PARA>
<PARA> We have recently approved $330,660 to the shire and it is rather surprising that the amount that we provided is actually more than $30,000 in excess of that recommended by the Queensland Grants Commission. So there is obviously some conflict in Queensland Government circles as to the degree of concern about this deficit. On the one hand, the deficit is of such concern that the Government can sack a council without trying to put an administrator in to work with that council, while on the other hand it is prepared to recommend a cutback in funds for that particular council. I hope that the administrator, who unfortunately has chosen to live in Cairns and not move to the shire he is trying to work with, will sort out the problems very speedily and that Minister Randell will re-call an early election for a democratically elected council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator McKiernan has just reminded me that, under the Standing Orders, I am not allowed to give an opinion. Clearly it could be nothing more than an opinion as to what constituted a bad or a good current account figure for September or for any other month. The program to which Senator Stone referred was reported with varying degrees of accuracy and comprehensiveness in various newspapers. I am not sure whether he was relying on the program itself or some of the newspaper reports. I think at one stage-and I must confess that I have not checked the transcript myself in detail-I referred to one month and at another point I referred to at least one additional month. Again I think it is a matter of judgment as to whether one needs one month or more than one month. Certainly some of the newspaper reports-indeed, all the newspaper reports that I saw-omitted this very important qualification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I described as the worst case scenario depicted, which I explicitly stated that I did not expect to happen, a statement which was not to my knowledge reported elsewhere, comprised much more than one or even more than one bad-however one cares to define that-set of monthly balance of payments figures. It included, in addition to that, a consequential substantial devaluation of the Australian dollar and the consequences that that would have for interest rates and so on. I do not know what else I can say other than that I put the view last Thursday-the program was actually recorded on Thursday-that it was too early to make those sorts of judgments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also heard the reports on radio this morning about Telecom's proposals in two areas in particular. One was the area of local calls, where it is proposed that charges will rise from 20c to 21c; and the second was the area of directory assistance charges, where, it was reported, Telecom proposes to increase charges for information on numbers already listed from 21c to approximately 60c. In respect of numbers not listed, the reports were unclear as to whether such a charge would be imposed. My understanding is that for those numbers not already listed there is no charge at the moment. The Government's basic position is that public authorities, in common with the private sector, should have to justify their price increases in the same way as does the private sector. The two items which were the subject of the report this morning are specifically notifiable under the Prices Surveillance Act and as a consequence proposed increases need to be notified within 21 days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the charges for local calls, I understand that on 26 August this year the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) considered Telecom's application and had no objection to changes on this item as proposed. The Authority recognised that the proposed increase reflected the withdrawal of the exemption from payroll tax previously allowed to Telecom. The second item, as I have already mentioned, is also notifiable to the Prices Surveillance Authority. In fact, it was most recently classified as such in March this year when I issued a direction to Telecom to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already had discussions with the Chairperson of the Prices Surveillance Authority, Mrs Hilda Rolfe, and it is anticipated that once this increase is notified to the Authority I will be able to direct the PSA to conduct a specific inquiry into this service. Honourable senators should realise that Telecom, in its relationship with the Prices Surveillance Authority, has an arrangement whereby it has been reporting its details on revenue, expenditure, capital and investment to the Authority on a quarterly basis. As a consequence, the Prices Surveillance Authority is in a much better position to give greater scrutiny to the proposals of this public authority. I am sure that, given that sort of relationship and information flow to the Prices Surveillance Authority, the utmost scrutiny will be given to the items proposed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Acting Attorney-General and Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Minister will recall earlier questions relating to the purported removal from office of the General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and his replacement by a colleague of the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Perkins. Was the Attorney-General's Department approached for, and did it provide, legal advice as to the purported removal of the General Manager? Is the Minister satisfied that the purported removal was lawful? Was the Public Service Commission consulted, and did it give its approval to the proposed appointment of Mr Cedric Wyatt as General Manager of the ADC, as required by section 33 (2) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act? Can the Minister reaffirm confidence in Mrs Shirley McPherson, who has been so wrongfully maligned by Mr Hand's hand-picked commissioners, except for two who showed a great display of courage?</PARA></TALK.START>

I know of no such advice. However, I will attempt to check that out and provide an answer as soon as possible. I am asked for an opinion as to whether the purported removal of Mr O'Brien was lawful.

The Government and, I am sure, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, are always prepared to work with a properly constituted chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission. The vote of no confidence which has been spoken about and about which there has been no formal conveyance of that resolution from the Commission to the Minister was a vote of the Commission and not of the Minister. The Commission has made that decision, if it turns out to be as reported. As I have said, I am sure that the Minister will continue to work with those properly constituted persons on the Commission and the officers of the Commission.

If so, what representations has the Government made to Vanuatu along those lines? Does the Minister think that, because members of this group have previously expressed support for Irian Jayan independence, they face personal danger if they are returned to Indonesia by Vanuatu? When will the Government make a final determination on the application for refugee status by these 19 Irian Jayans? Why has it taken the Government so long to process their applications?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continuing detention in Vanuatu of five members of the group in question is a manifestly unsatisfactory state of affairs and it has been acknowledged frankly to be such by the Vanuatu Government in discussions that I have had with it. Everyone is trying to find a way through the situation at the moment. We have been working very closely with the Vanuatu Government to try to find a satisfactory and workable solution, including making contacts with the Netherlands and a number of other governments in recent days. That process is continuing. It is one in which I have been personally very actively involved, including during my most recent overseas visit. Beyond that I cannot say any more at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second aspect, I do not make any judgment about whether the people in question would face danger or disadvantage if they were to be returned to Indonesia. What I can say is that, to my knowledge, the option of possible return to Indonesia is not one that is being contemplated by the Vanuatu authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the question, the processing of applications for refugee status is very much a matter for my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, who has, however, given me, just a few moments ago, the following advice: in July 1988 members of the group in question did request resettlement in Australia as refugees. One of the group, who happens to be a Dutch national, has already been rejected because he does have prior protection in the Netherlands. The spouse of another one holds a Solomon Islands passport and would equally appear to be prima facie ineligible for consideration under this category. In August this year, as is required of all applicants for entry, the group was invited to submit formal application forms and supporting material for consideration of refugee resettlement. As far as we are aware, these papers have not been submitted as yet and the claims of the group will be considered in detail by Senator Ray and his Department when those papers are received.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is yes, as it is to the first part of the question which asked whether I had seen Mr Moore's press statement. It is a most extraordinary document, riddled with factual error and sloppy thinking. As someone who has had some contact with Mr Moore on a parliamentary committee I am surprised that he has had put out in his name a document which is so riddled with factual error and sloppy thinking. Mr Moore said that the Government has relied upon `naive officials of the Attorney-General's Department to negotiate with specialists in private enterprise possessing far greater commercial nous'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many errors in that statement but I will go through some of them. Firstly, the Government obtained the services of Mr Uhrig as a consultant for this exercise. Secondly, the involvement of the Public Service was through the task force on asset sales, which is chaired by an officer of the Department of Finance and has a representative from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Administrative Services. It relies upon legal advice tendered to it by the Attorney-General's Department. To the best of my knowledge the legal advice given by the Attorney-General's Department to that committee has been very sound. It is, however, not an Attorney-General's Department exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> We had a very prominent and well respected former businessman, Mr Uhrig, as a consultant to the task force. However, I object to the implication that Commonwealth officials are naive. I have already given my opinion and the opinion of the public servants on the task force that Mr Uhrig's services to that Committee were very valuable in this instance. Mr Moore made the assertion in his press statement that public servants are incapable and incompetent of doing this sort of job. I have not published this before but in relation to another major assets sale, that of surplus land at the Tokyo embassy, the Government had also retained a private sector adviser. Had the advice at one point of that private sector adviser been taken by the public servants the Commonwealth taxpayers would have finished up with a considerably smaller return for that property-in the order of $60m to $80m.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is not only unfair of Mr Moore to charge the Public Service, and more specifically the naive officials of the Attorney-General's Department, as he puts it, with incompetence but it is also in conflict with the record on the second largest asset disposal that this Government has conducted. I do not know what Mr Moore would like to have. Perhaps he would like this Government to follow the sort of arrangements that his ideological soulmates in London followed when they started selling assets a few years ago. I will be providing a few more details to the public about that in a week or two.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go through every paragraph of the press release but I will deal with only one more paragraph. Mr Moore said:</PARA>
<PARA>While Westpac has purchased the loan portfolio the Government has retained its open-ended subsidy liability to the tune of $145m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, his figure is too high and, secondly, the Government's subsidy exposure, if you like, is exactly the same as it was before the portfolio was sold. The taxpayers received a premium payment over and above the face value of the debt of $100m which, if adjusted for the actual timing of certain receipts, converts to a value at the time of payment in present value terms equivalent to $85m. I will not say any more other than to express my amazement that Mr Moore, at one stage a prominent businessman and stockbroker, and to the best of my knowledge a reasonably well informed and responsible Opposition spokesman, could have put his name to such a shoddy press release as this one.</PARA>

The circumstances of the remarks involved a debate in the New South Wales Parliament on a motion put by Peter Collins about visiting nuclear warships-although it did not mention the word `nuclear'. He commended the Federal Government for the planning and execution of the naval salute and endorsed the commitment of the Federal and State governments to permit warships to undertake basic repairs. There were so many errors made during the course of this debate that I would suggest that Peter Collins or Premier Greiner sack their researchers, or that Special Branch get its facts up to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the comments made during the course of this debate was that my husband was Bob Collins. I am sure that Senator Collins will be very surprised to find that out. He may have to make a personal explanation now too. The remarks that were made were actually referring to my ex-husband, Brett Collins, about whom Senator Evans made a couple of magnificent speeches in the Senate in 1982 when my ex-husband was facing deportation. I am very pleased to be able now to place it on record that it was because of the Federal Government's revocation of that deportation order that Brett was able to stay in Australia. Although we are no longer married, we are the best of friends. However, the Prisoners Action Group was not involved in peace activities on that particular day. My ex-husband is now a printer and works for the progressive movement on a range of causes. He is, I suppose, what one would call a respectable businessman. </PARA>

He calls me a would-be senator, but he is obviously ignoring the fact that, inherent in being No. 2 on any ticket, one is deemed eligible to represent one's party or cause if something happens to the person who is No. 1 on the ticket. I take objection to his remarks about my election but I would refer him to the Electoral Commission. I defend myself by saying that I did nothing in this respect to steal the seat from anybody. I was properly elected and my actions have been totally above board. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill marks a new stage in Social Security administration in this country. It is a further plank to the Government's social justice priority of achieving equality of legal rights for all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will establish an informal, accessible, quick and free mechanism for social security claimants to secure their legal entitlements to pensions, benefits and allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is an integral component of developing a more rational and understandable system of decision-making in Social Security. It provides for all levels of administrative review both internal and external. There will be provision for a review to be conducted by the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as the first tier of external review and then by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as the second tier of external review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Appeals Tribunal has been operating since 1975 under ministerial direction. It has had no legislative foundation and has had no power to decide cases. Its function has been to recommend to the Secretary that a decision under review be either affirmed, varied or set aside. This Bill will provide the Social Security Appeals Tribunal with determinative powers and will make it a statutory tribunal with responsibility for the first level of external review. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of a legal power in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to determine appeals has been seen as a deficiency in the social security review system. It has been the subject of comment by many observers, including the Administrative Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Review Council reported that the absence of determinative powers has exacerbated the problem of delay in processing appeals and accordingly has undermined the objective of minimising the time taken to finalise appeals. In Report No. 21 on the Structure and Form of Social Security Appeals (April 1984) the Council concluded that conferring a power of determination on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal would enhance its credibility and standing. It would also ensure its independence from the Department and would contribute to a reduction in the time taken to finalise appeals at the first level of the appeals structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of any system of review of administrative decisions should be to provide for the resolution of grievances by correct and authoritative decisions which command general confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this object the Social Security Appeals Tribunal must retain its flexible structure and the informal procedures it has developed in the past 12 years. Otherwise there is a danger that this Tribunal will duplicate the style of hearing now conducted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is not a desirable aim for the first tier of external review. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is designed to ensure that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal retains its accessibility and informality while exercising its more extensive powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will state the objective of review as being to provide a mechanism for review of decisions under the Social Security Act that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. The tribunal is specifically directed to have regard to this objective in making hearings as informal as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will have the powers of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to affirm, vary or set aside a decision. The Tribunal will be able to shorten the period during which the Department must make its submission to the Tribunal where there are cases of financial hardship. This will enable determination of the appeal as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As is presently the case, no legal costs will be met or awarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be able to meet reasonable travel and accommodation costs plus the costs of any medical examinations where those examinations are arranged by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The power of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to reconsider a case at any time will also be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing informal character of Social Security Appeals Tribunal hearings will not be significantly altered under this restructured scheme. The Tribunal will not be bound by rules of evidence or notions of judicial procedure. Hearings will be conducted in private unless the presiding member at a hearing has decided otherwise after having regard to the need to protect the privacy of the parties and their wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> Tribunal hearings will retain their existing features: usually they take the form of a discussion between the Tribunal panel and the appellant. Notwithstanding this, an appellant will be able to be represented at a hearing by any person. The Bill provides for the continuation of the current practice of receiving applications for review orally as well as in writing. Where an oral application is received the person who receives the application will be required to record its receipt in writing. Withdrawal of applications can also be made orally or in writing with a similar requirement to make a written record where an application is withdrawn orally. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of Australia's administrative review system is that administrative tribunals are called upon to apply Government policy on various matters. This occurs when the legislation that the Tribunal applies does not clearly dictate what decision should be arrived at in the particular case. In such cases Administrative Tribunals have long held that they will have regard to Government policy in deciding the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that where the Government desires to require the SSAT to take account of Government policy in this way it will be necessary to table the relevant policy in both Houses-guaranteeing full public accountability in the administration of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the objectives of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are achieved, the Tribunal will be organised and administered on a national basis. A full time National Convener will be responsible for the administration of the Tribunal and for ensuring uniformity and consistency of decision-making by members. The National Convener will also be responsible for the general management of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a senior member in each State and a mix of full-time and part-time members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal often requires background information about the operations of the Department of Social Security. To have a departmental representative appearing before the Tribunal may create an adversarial environment for the hearing of appeals. This is undesirable. Departmental officers will therefore continue to be appointed as members of the Tribunal. However, to ensure their independence from the Department they will be appointed to the statutory position of Member of the Tribunal and will not be departmental officers for their period of appointment to the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill prohibits oral submissions by or representation of the Secretary and will thereby prevent the development of adversarial procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The current practice of three member panels will continue. The National Convener will have a discretion to add a medical member as required and to authorise panels consisting of fewer than three members in special circumstances. The National Convener and Senior Members will be appointed by the Governor-General. The National Convener will be appointed for up to 5 years and senior members will be appointed for a period of up to 3 years. Other members will be appointed for a period of up to 3 years. Because the SSAT deals with a number of applications in relation to age pensions there will be no bar to members being appointed beyond the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also include provisions regulating the operations of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department will be required to provide a statement setting out its findings, evidence and reasons for the decision under review together with supporting documents. This must be provided to the Tribunal within 28 days of receipt of notification of lodgment of an appeal. The National Convener can ask the Secretary to provide the statement and documents earlier than the expiry of the 28-day deadline. The most likely situation where this will arise is where a person could experience financial hardship pending resolution of the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Social Security Appeals Tribunal arrives at its decision it will be required to provide a statement setting out the findings referring to the evidence and giving the reasons for its decision. In the event of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the Social Security Appeals Tribunal's reasons will become the statement required under section 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The Department of Social Security will still provide the relevant documentation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above requirements, the Tribunal will be required to act in accordance with substantial justice and merits according to the circumstances of the case and it will be empowered to obtain evidence on oath or to request the Secretary to serve a notice requiring a person to provide such relevant information or documents. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill marks an important step in development of the Department of Social Security's own decision making. It codifies and more precisely defines the Department's powers and duties to review decisions and establishes the office of `authorised review officer'. </PARA>
<PARA> A determinative first tier external review tribunal will provide a greater contribution to administrative efficiency and effectiveness in achieving legislative policy objectives by providing consistent guidance in the proper exercise of statutory powers by departmental decision-makers. </PARA>
<PARA> To make the Social Security Appeals Tribunal responsible for its own decisions is consistent with this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Appeals Tribunal currently reviews up to 12,000 cases a year. The first tier of external review is designed, given this caseload, to be informal and quick. There needs to be a mechanism of further administrative review for complex and difficult cases. This will be provided by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Secretary to the Department of Social Security and persons who are affected by decisions of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Education allowances for Aboriginal students are available from the Federal Government under the Aboriginal Secondary Assistance Scheme (ABSEC) and the Aboriginal Study Assistance Scheme (ABSTUDY).</PARA>
<PARA> Under ABSEC, students receive</PARA>
<PARA> Living Allowance, which is age-related and payable at the at-home or away-from-home rate</PARA>
<PARA> school fees, up to a limit of $3,000 pa for approved boarders and up to $150 pa for under 16 `at-home' students</PARA>
<PARA> fares between home and school each term for approved boarders</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Education Assistance, in the form of tutorial support, excursion allowances, and other educational guidance programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Full-time students in post-secondary courses, under ABSTUDY receive</PARA>
<PARA> Living Allowance, which is age-related and payable at the at-home or away-from-home rate</PARA>
<PARA> Higher Education Administration Charge Allowance. Incidentals Allowance, to assist with payment for textbooks, equipment and fees</PARA>
<PARA> fares for students living away from home</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Education Assistance, in the form of tutorial support and assistance with compulsory field trips.</PARA>
<PARA> Full time pensioner students, under ABSTUDY receive</PARA>
<PARA> Pensioner Education Supplement</PARA>
<PARA> Higher Education Administration Charge Allowance</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Education Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Part-time ABSTUDY students receive</PARA>
<PARA> part-time allowance, dependent on length of course and hours of study</PARA>
<PARA> Higher Education Administration Charge Allowance</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Education Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> ABSTUDY also provides assistance for participation in</PARA>
<PARA> Testing and Assessment Awards</PARA>
<PARA> education conferences</PARA>
<PARA> study tours</PARA>
<PARA> short courses.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For ABSEC students, the major changes in 1988 have been</PARA>
<PARA> single age-related Living Allowance to replace three allowances previously paid separately (Living Allowance, Book and Clothing Allowance, Personal Allowance) on a grade-related basis</PARA>
<PARA> Living Allowance is now paid over 52 weeks of the year rather than 44</PARA>
<PARA> Living Allowance for students under 16 has been reduced (but the total Commonwealth payment for these students should remain the same because most ABSEC families will receive assistance under the Family Allowance Supplement in 1988)</PARA>
<PARA> introduction of the limits on school fees noted above</PARA>
<PARA> assistance for excursions is restricted to excursions involving at least one overnight stay; previously ABSEC paid for all excursions</PARA>
<PARA> For ABSTUDY students, the major changes in 1988 have been</PARA>
<PARA> Living Allowances are now age-related, and more consistent with AUSTUDY rates</PARA>
<PARA> introduction of a $30 pw supplement to Living Allowance for students 21 years and over studying in courses leading to awards or direct employment outcomes</PARA>
<PARA> hobby and personal development courses are no longer supported</PARA>
<PARA> the Incidentals Allowance has replaced fee payment, Book and Clothing Allowance and Establishment Allowance</PARA>
<PARA> pensioner students are no longer eligible to receive ABSTUDY Living Allowance while receiving certain pensions; the Education Supplement replaces the ABSTUDY Living Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) From 1989 the current ABSEC and ABSTUDY schemes will be combined into a single scheme to be known as ABSTUDY. The scheme will have Schools and Post School/Tertiary elements. Earlier proposals to make payments through AUSTUDY and the Department of Social Security (DSS) will not be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA> The major changes for 1989 are as follows</PARA>
<PARA> an income test will be introduced for the Living Allowance for students 16 years and over and for boarders. The test will be based on the AUSTUDY income test, but modified in recognition of the needs of Aboriginal families and students</PARA>
<PARA> students under 16 years living at home will receive an Education Supplement paid in four instalments rather than fortnightly payments. The Education Supplement will be income tested on the basis of entitlement to Family Allowance Supplement or a Social Security pension or benefit</PARA>
<PARA> all other benefits currently paid under ABSEC and AUSTUDY will continue to be paid free of income test</PARA>
<PARA> the limits on school fees for boarders, Excursion Allowance and Incidentals Allowance will be indexed</PARA>
<PARA> the limit on excursions attracting assistance will be changed from an overnight excursion to one costing $10 or more</PARA>
<PARA> the expenses payable under school fees for approved boarders will include boarding fees above the level of Living Allowance payable and not simply tuition fees</PARA>
<PARA> the rate of Living Allowance will be increased for most students and will now be more consistent with the rate of unemployment benefit in order to maximise the incentive for Aboriginal people to enter education.</PARA>

Badly designed or maintained air conditioning has been linked with Legionnaires Disease, Pontiac Fever and Humidifier Fever. Viral infections are reported to have been spread by air conditioning, and asthma and allergies triggered off, exacerbated or prolonged through the entrapment and entrainment of allergens in air conditioning systems. Moulds and bacteria have also been spread through poorly maintained air conditioning.</PARA>
