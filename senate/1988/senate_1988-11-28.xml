<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we are concerned that the Judeo-Christian moral values which have been fundamental in our laws and education systems since the foundation of the country are now being undermined in the current practice of law making, and we are concerned that the values of the secular-humanistic philosophy have taken their place therefore jeopardizing the moral climate of our society and contributing towards immorality and violence in our society.</PARA>

<PARA>The Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> That we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Attorney-General to the decision of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) to conduct a private hearing into the affairs of Rothwells Ltd and its associated companies because of the Commission's belief that, `offences that involve fraud or dishonesty may have been committed'. I ask the Minister whether he has noted these comments by the Chairman of the Commission, Mr Henry Bosch, on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio this morning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think there's a great deal of public concern and I think it would be more reassuring to the public for it to be seen that there is a formal investigation process going ahead immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister not agree that investor confidence in the operation of Australian financial markets would be greatly enhanced if any such inquiry into the affairs of the collapsed merchant bank were conducted in public? If so, what can the Government do to ensure that either the investigation or its results will be made public? If that is not possible, will it seek the agreement of the Dowding Government to a joint Federal-State royal commission?</PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And answer my question of 4 November at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what question that was. In answer to Senator Messner, I believe that the sort of investigation being undertaken by the National Companies and Securities Commission will be important in creating an atmosphere, an assurance, within the public generally and within the investing community in particular that the particular matters relating to Rothwells will be fully, quite impartially and vigorously investigated under the auspices of the National Companies and Securities Commission. It is a very important step that has been taken. I myself did not hear Mr Bosch on the radio this morning. In fact, I saw him at Melbourne Airport as I passed through coming up from Hobart. Whilst I spoke to him briefly about this matter, he did not raise the particular matters of concern which the honourable senator attributed to him as being broadcast this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the particular investigation being undertaken by the National Companies and Securities Commission is appropriate to determine what action needs to be taken in relation to possible breaches of the relevant legislation. It has chosen to conduct a private hearing under section 36 of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act into Rothwells and its associated companies. It is expected that that will provide a sufficient and proper venue and means for examining the wide range of questions surrounding Rothwells. Do not forget that the National Companies and Securities Commission, using this process, has the power to summon witnesses to appear before the hearing and take evidence on oath.</PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, open for the National Companies and Securities Commission at any stage to request the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, or any State or Commonwealth member of the Ministerial Council, to arrange a special investigation. But the National Companies and Securities Commission has not made such a request or sought any such direction, nor has it requested further resources for its current investigation. In fact, that was the particular question, if I may say so, that I put informally to Mr Bosch at Tullamarine Airport this morning. He indicated that he considered that the Commission was sufficiently well placed to undertake this investigation.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am relaying to the honourable senator an answer given to me by Mr Bosch in relation to this particular investigation. He says that the resources are adequate. I believe it would be quite premature to speculate on what further resources might be necessary if certain further events occur. This matter can be undertaken, I am assured by Mr Bosch, quite speedily in its commencement and vigorously, though, of course, it may take some time to actually be completed. I believe the National Companies and Securities Commission will report to the Ministerial Council, which I think meets later this week, on the status of its investigation and the anticipated scope of its hearing. That will take place, as I said, later this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one part of the question related to the possibility of public hearings. I must say that I am getting a little wary of public hearings where allegations are made before royal commissioners which perhaps are never substantiated and never lead to the laying of charges. My own experience in relation to the National Crime Authority and to the decision by the Senate committee which I chaired and which devised the structure and mode of operation of that Authority, I believe, is correct; namely, that on the whole these matters are best undertaken with the protection of privacy so that, whilst questions, of course, can be asked of a most penetrating and full kind, they are not asked in a way which leads to public exposure and allegations which, as I said, are not assessed in the same way in which they would be in a court of law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister expressed concern about the rights of individuals. He might have some concern for the rights of the taxpayers of Western Australia. Would he not agree that the NCSC is limited in the extent that it can pursue matters which have now been identified, such as fraud and dishonesty and that, consequently, those matters ought to be pursued in public? Does he not agree that, obviously, the NCSC may not have the legal capacity to pursue those matters?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already indicated that the NCSC is vested with very considerable power in relation to summoning witnesses and obtaining documents, questioning those witnesses and assessing those documents. I believe that it is vested with sufficient power. Indeed, as I say, neither Mr Bosch nor the NCSC has indicated to the Government that they believe that the investigation that the Commission may undertake under section 36 would be inadequate for it to determine the matters surrounding the management of the affairs of Rothwells Ltd. It is a very worrying matter, obviously, that Mr Bosch should speak about allegations involving fraud or dishonesty. I believe that the sort of investigation that the NCSC can undertake is the best process available at this stage for the investigation of those allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already expressed the Government's very grave concern about the events which took place yesterday at the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Sydney during which a teenager was shot by a member of the Consulate-General staff. Without repeating the whole of that widely reported statement of last night, I repeat that the Government regards this incident as both intolerable and totally unacceptable. Whether or not, as claimed by the Yugoslav authorities, protective security by New South Wales police and others was not adequate is essentially a side issue which cannot begin to justify the use of firearms. I am advised that the security protection provided at the Consulate-General was composed of four Australian Protective Service officers and seven members of the New South Wales police force. I have asked my Department to report to me on the arrangements made for police protection of the Consulate-General and I will certainly follow up this aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I announced last night, the Government has stressed, both in Canberra and in Belgrade, the urgent need for the Yugoslav authorities to meet three Australian requests. These are, firstly, that the security officer concerned be made available for interview by the New South Wales police; secondly, that the firearm which was used-a question arises as to whether it was licensed-be surrendered to the New South Wales police; and, thirdly, that the security guard remain for the present within the Consulate-General premises and certainly not endeavour to leave Australia. I am pleased to report that the Yugoslav Ambassador, following his consultations with Belgrade, has this morning given an assurance that these three requests will be met. We have advised the New South Wales police accordingly and further investigation of the matter is now in their hands. I add for the record that no question of diplomatic or consular immunity for the officer concerned has been raised by the Yugoslav authorities. The handling of the matter is, accordingly, proceeding on the Australian side on the basis that no such immunity exists or will be claimed. I wish to assure the Senate, finally, that I am advised that appropriate measures are being taken by the relevant police authorities to ensure that there are no further acts of violence of this nature in Sydney or elsewhere.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted reports of the enormous storm damage caused in the Hervey Bay region of Queensland on Tuesday, 23 November, and costing an unofficially estimated $1m in damage to caravans and power lines, unroofed houses and uprooted trees? Is it the intention of the Federal Government to consult with its Queensland counterparts with a view to providing financial relief to individuals, families and local authorities adversely affected by the storm damage?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to natural disasters generally, it is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth to consult with any State government. The declaration of this storm, or any other storm or drought, as a natural disaster is the responsibility of the State government concerned-in this case, the Queensland Government. In the event that the Queensland Government declares the Hervey Bay storm a natural disaster, expenditure, if any, of Commonwealth funds will be in accordance with the 1988-89 natural disaster relief arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To date there has been no notification from the Queensland Government that it intends to so declare the Hervey Bay storm. It probably will not do so because the people affected by the storm, from Senator Jones's description, are not the sort of people who normally are favoured clients of the Queensland Government. Its favoured clients are people who are National Party of Australia organisers in north Queensland, such as Mr Michael Behan-who is no relation to Senator Michael Beahan, of course-and those who otherwise respond to the arm twisting of the Queensland Government to contribute to the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is a convention on food irradiation to be included in the agenda of a forthcoming meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva? Who is representing Australia at this GATT meeting to handle discussion on this food irradiation convention and what are their occupation and governmental associations? Is Ms Jan Taylor, a pro-irradiation spokesperson from Queensland, attending? Will she be speaking on behalf of the Government and, if not, will this be made clear to the meeting? As a signatory to GATT, will the adoption of this convention on food irradiation bind Australia, making it mandatory for us, firstly, to allow the importation of food irradiated overseas and, secondly, to allow the establishment of food irradiation plants in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An international conference on the acceptance, control of and trade in irradiated foods, sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organisation and the International Trade Centre, is to take place in Geneva on 12 to 16 December. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is not a sponsor of the conference, although along with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development it jointly funds the International Trade Centre, which is, as I said, one of the co-sponsors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aim of the conference is to adopt an agreed document on the harmonisation of national approaches to the control of the food irradiation process and international trade in irradiated foods for consideration then by national governments. The conference is not scheduled to consider any draft convention under GATT. Any adoption of the conference document would have no effect whatsoever on Australia's rights and obligations as a GATT signatory.</PARA>
<PARA> As to representation at the conference, Australia will be represented by Australian Government officials based in relevant European posts. A number of different portfolio interests are obviously involved in this issue, and we have taken the decision to attend based on the principle, which may not be acceptable in this place but which makes some sense to me, that knowledge is to be preferred to ignorance when one is embarking upon a consideration of these sensitive issues. To avoid any concern that the representation of officials at the conference might be construed as endorsement of some particular substantive position by Australia, I have directed that it be made clear that representation at the conference should not be taken as support for the process and certainly also should not be seen as pre-empting the work of the parliamentary Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, I have set two conditions for Australian participation: first, that participation is to be without prejudice for the Government's consideration of the parliamentary Committee's report and the development of a comprehensive government approach to the question of food irradiation; and, secondly, that Australian delegates are to make clear that, pending the submission of the report of the parliamentary Committee and the consideration of that report, the Australian Government has not adopted a position on food irradiation.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the other lady the honourable senator mentioned, Ms Taylor from the Queensland Consumer Affairs Bureau has been invited in a personal capacity by the conference organisers to present a keynote paper.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2962" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the letter. It appears over the name of Andrew Peacock, but the level of economic literacy-for somebody who, by his own admission, does not bring an accountant's approach to Budget matters or into any sort of figuring-which is displayed in the letter is obviously far too high for it to have been Mr Peacock's own work. I suspect it was written by Dr Hewson, but he did not want to put his name to it lest it appear that he was trying to pinch Mr Peacock's job-which, of course, he is. The letter is, as I have said, economically literate, but it is wrong on the subject of the effect on recorded average labour productivity of a more intensive use of the existing capital stock. I should say here that it appears that Mr Peacock has used the third quarter of 1984 as the base for his assessment. The letter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A more intensive use of our existing capital stock, such as the working of extra shifts, would increase output and may result in an increase, decrease, or indeed, no change in labour productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that when an economy emerges from a deep recession there is scope for average labour productivity to increase, largely because there would under such circumstances be an oversupply of skilled and highly productive labour which is either not being utilised at all or not being fully utilised. In other words, there would be skilled labour on the payroll surplus to the immediate requirements of the firm. There may also be some capital lying idle. Once the economy has emerged from the recession-such a recession as the Australian economy had by the third quarter of 1984-the situation is different. If a manufacturing firm, for example-or a mine, probably, for that matter-wanted to put on a second shift, it would have to dilute its work force with a less skilled or unskilled work force, which would tend to slow the pace of operation, or there are likely to be more operations or perhaps some decline in quality. But the average output per worker would be brought down by that. Secondly, because once a second shift is being worked the plant and equipment is subject to more intensive use, it is likely to require more maintenance and repair, but simultaneously there will be less scheduled downtime in order for that maintenance and repair to be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, however, Mr Stutchbury's much more comprehensive argument on this matter was correct. The letter in this morning's Australian Financial Review was incorrect-whoever wrote it-at least in so far as that aspect of Mr Stutchbury's article was concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government regrets the decision of the United States Administration to refuse a visa to PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat, to enable him to address the current session of the UN General Assembly. The United States has an obligation under the United States-United Nations Headquarters Agreement to permit the entry into the United States of people engaged in UN business. Yasser Arafat was to address the General Assembly when it considers Middle East items in the coming week, something it has not done since 1974. Australia hopes that this issue can still be resolved in the appropriate forums, including the UN Committee on Relations with the Host Country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We certainly acknowledge the concern of the United States about the involvement of the PLO in terrorist act. Australia has emphatically urged the PLO to comprehensively rule out the use of terrorism, most recently in statements that I and the Prime Minister made last week, and it is the case that United States citizens have suffered badly in recent years at the hands of PLO terrorists, but the refusal of a visa comes at a time when the PLO appears to be moving in positive directions, including towards the renunciation of terrorism and acceptance of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, at least as the basis for an international conference designed to advance the settlement of the Middle East dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation, I guess, shows once again the need for the PLO to take a further step to build on the welcome steps taken at the Palestine National Council meeting in Algiers, to renounce unequivocally the use of terrorism and to recognise explicitly the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognised borders. We will certainly continue to urge the Palestinians to take that course.</PARA>

The reports say that illegal logging in the area has added to the devastation, as mudslides studded with logs are sweeping through low lying villages. An estimated 300,000 people have been made homeless and food supplies are becoming scarce, as the floods have cut off road and rail links. While Thailand will rely first on its own resources to assist the victims of this disaster, we have been advised of statements by the Foreign Minister and the Chief of the Armed Forces making it clear that the Thais would welcome external assistance. I have decided, accordingly, that Australia will contribute $200,000 in emergency relief from Australian International Development Assistance Bureau funds to victims of the flooding, the worst in Thailand for some 40 years. Australian relief funds will be used to provide assistance to those directly affected by the devastation.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the current serious disruption at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA), the predicted increase in tourism into Australia and the need to service both that tourism and domestic air travellers, when will the Government stop procrastinating and heed the warning given last week by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines that the domestic airline system will collapse unless a third runway is built-a solution that would increase available capacity by some 40 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has made it clear that this question is being closely addressed by the Government in the context of the report that has just been received from the working group set up by the Commonwealth and State governments to explore what are realistic options financially, environmentally and in terms of the operational requirements of the whole Sydney basin. Delays at Kingsford-Smith Airport are mainly a consequence of runway capacity and overscheduling by the airlines at particular times of the day rather than any shortfall in air traffic control facilities. That point needs to be made because it is a recurring theme in some criticisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It remains our policy, as it had been for a number of years, not to build a third runway at KSA. We have taken the view that Badgerys Creek offers a more cost effective and ecologically sound solution to the airport needs of Sydney. It is certainly anticipated that, even with that development going ahead at Badgerys Creek, as we hope it will in due course-and sooner rather than later-KSA will remain the main airport for international and domestic airlines services at Sydney for the foreseeable future. The proposed international terminal extensions will meet Sydney's needs into the next decade and will be financed totally by the Federal Airports Corporation. No money will need to come from taxpayers' funds. Those international terminal extensions are not an alternative to the development of the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek; they are complementary to that development and KSA will continue to remain the focal point for international services. The belief of the Government essentially is that provided progress starts at Badgerys Creek and there is some rationalisation and reorganisation, particularly of the very small aircraft that are using Kingsford-Smith Airport at peak times at the moment and very badly clogging the system, it ought to be possible within a relatively short time frame to establish an acceptable environment that will be consistent with the airport needs not only of Sydney but of this country as a whole.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the Senate on the outlook for petroleum exploration in Australia, which remains strong. In fact last Thursday I released a document, the quarterly survey of exploration and development statistics for the Australian petroleum, minerals and resource industry. That shows that offshore activity was particularly strong in the last quarter leading to the end of September, with 10 offshore wells being completed, the largest number of offshore wells drilled from an exploration point of view for over 2 1/2 years. Offshore exploration drilling is expected to continue at approximately that level for the December quarter as well. Eight offshore rigs are currently working in Australian waters, seven in the North West Shelf and Timor Sea region and one in the Gippsland Basin off Victoria, in the Bass Strait area, reflecting what I believe is the industry's belief that the best prospects for large oil discoveries in the future in Australia lie offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also released last week a revised assessment of the outlook for petroleum exploration activities in Australia in 1988, prepared by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This shows that the outlook for offshore activity in 1989-next year-is strong, particularly in the Timor Sea, given a substantial number of wells already committed, numbering 33.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Beahan refers in his question to low oil prices. Those who have followed the fortunes of the vicissitudes of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the papers in recent weeks will see that it still looks likely that we will be expecting for some time yet a difficulty in OPEC to maintain control over production levels and, because of the declining influence of OPEC, the overproduction as well of non-OPEC countries. When we add that to a very mild northern winter and the fact that the market is currently overhung by about 30 million barrels of oil per day across the world, we expect low oil prices to remain for some time. Notwithstanding that, the types of statistics I have been able to give show that there is still strong activity, even in the context of low price, in Australia. Indeed, soon I will be announcing the outcome of bids for exploration acreage that we released for bidding earlier this year. They will, when released, show strong competition for the choice areas of exploration zones offshore in Australia as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council met on 4 November. The Ministers participating agreed to a review of the role, structure and objectives of the Corporation. The Corporation last had a review in, I think, 1982. It is appropriate that the future structure of the Corporation Board, the planning controls and particularly the Corporation's relationship with local government, be reviewed, as well as the return of $1.6m it will be making to the Commonwealth, which was announced in the Budget this year. There will also be a general review of operations, particularly the Corporation's relationship with the community generally. The review is being undertaken by a committee comprising officials of the Federal Government, New South Wales and Victoria. I expect that the review outcomes will enhance the growth centre's ability to meet future socio-economic objectives over the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I would just like to take the time of the Senate briefly to run through some of the statistics relating to the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. Private sector investment per capita in the growth centre has outstripped national tends since 1973-74 in every year except 1975-76. Over the period 1971 to 1986, Albury-Wodonga's per annum percentage growth in private employment has averaged 4.2 per cent higher than Australia generally. Average annual employment growth has been 4.8 per cent from 1971 to 1986. Total employment increase over the same period by industry has been: manufacturing employment, 140 per cent; retailing, 99 per cent; community services, 281 per cent. Honourable senators can see that Albury-Wodonga has achieved a great deal but it is appropriate in a different economic climate that its operations be reviewed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that Australia Post, like any well run business, has been examining its operations to ensure that it maximises its efficiency, its responsiveness to customer needs and its contribution to the Australian economy. Australia Post has also been considering ways to strengthen the financial position of its retail network and has written to the general secretaries of the Australian Postmasters Association, the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists and the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union regarding proposed guidelines for the development of Australia Post retail facilities to improve its commercial viability while better meeting customer expectations. The proposed guidelines-indeed the whole matter-are at a very preliminary stage and are intended only to form a basis for discussion at this stage. Media reports, on which Senator Bjelke-Petersen is no doubt relying, which have suggested that they represent a program for the closure or withdrawal of Australia Post facilities are, I am advised, a gross misrepresentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not envisaged that there will be a significant change in the number of Australia Post outlets. Rather, the intention is to reappraise the Australia Post service network on a regional basis to ensure that the community's requirements continue to be met in a more efficient and flexible way. In the end, this may involve a different mix of service outlets and locations, additional services, and new and different products for sale. Australia Post's aim is not to reduce levels of service to the community but rather to reduce costs while maintaining or improving services. I should add further that I am advised that any changes would take place over a number of years. Australia Post envisages that consideration of any options would be undertaken through wide consultation with community groups, interested individuals, local government officials, local politicians, staff associations, Australia Post staff, and post office agents. Through this process a reasonable consensus will be developed on arrangements that provide better services to customers-or so it is hoped.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the government business enterprises reform process Australia Post will be required to meet a financial target that will be agreed in advance by the Minister. In considering that financial target one important aspect to be taken into account is the cost of providing services that may not be commercially viable but are required as a consequence of meeting Government objectives. One clear objective to which this Government is committed is ensuring that Australia Post continues to provide adequate services to people in Australia, no matter where they live-this meets the point made by Senator Bjelke-Petersen about country services-and to do so at universal prices. That is a very important principle to reaffirm. If that means accepting a lower financial return from Australia Post as a business, this Government accepts that that is appropriate and proper. Finally, while Australia Post is expected to look for all responsible cost saving measures, any firm decisions by Australia Post in this area will need fully to satisfy the Government that services to the public will continue to meet community needs throughout Australia.</PARA>

Are these reports correct? What can, and is, the Government doing about it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports are, unfortunately, correct. We became aware of reports that South African coal was being exported from Belgium to France and labelled as Australian coal in order to beat a 1986 ban applied by France as part of its embargo against South Africa. Upon hearing that, we sought confirmation and we were told that the matter was being investigated by both the Belgian and French authorities. I understand that the Minister for Industry in France has announced that the substitution of name is correct and that the coal in question was South African coal, not Australian coal as labelled, and has said something to the effect that the responsible Belgian Minister simply wanted to avoid any problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very easy for coal to lose its national identity when put into stockpiles along with other coal in trans-shipment centres. It is widely known as well that South Africa, with the connivance of some other countries from time to time, tries to launder its coal exports in this and other ways. As I have said, the embargo on South African coal in France applied from 1986. It was to be effected by a ban on new contracts. Coal under old contracts continues to be delivered. In terms of what our response might be, we recognise primarily that it is a matter for the French authorities as they impose the sanctions and it is those sanctions in this case which have been flouted.</PARA>
<PARA> I am perturbed about this sort of development. In Australia we will be monitoring the French investigations and the result of those investigations. I have also asked for an investigation to be conducted to ascertain the extent that Australia's name is being taken in vain in this sort of substitution and what other forms of laundering methods exist which affect the marketability of Australian coal. I think it is important to record that, as far as Australia is concerned, we are the world's leading coal exporter and we are a target for this type of shoddy practice when it might occur. We have stood four square and strong in international forums for openness and transparency in the trade of minerals and agriculture. In particular, we have sought to identify the extent to which subsidies make up coal production in other countries and what other practices might be engaged in. It is in Australia's best interests not only to monitor the situation but also to conduct an investigation to expose this sort of malpractice when it occurs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that on 3 November Australia voted in favour of a new resolution at the United Nations concerning the human rights of the population of the Israeli occupied territories. Australia's vote and the explanation of it, to which Senator Panizza referred, reflect a deep concern at the continued unrest in the territories and the increasing levels of violence which have led to loss of life, injury, destruction of property and arbitrary measures on the part of the occupying power. We were joined in voting in favour by 11 members of the European Community and other western European states. We have condemned strongly certain practices used by Israel, including the use of live ammunition and, more recently, plastic bullets against Palestinian demonstrators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose it is a matter of judgment as to whether the terminology employed by the acting ambassador in the explanation of the vote was appropriate to describe the particular practices and activities of Israel as an occupying power to which I referred. It may be that others would have exercised a different judgment in the particular choice of words. But I do not think Senator Panizza can quarrel with the expression of very strong concern at the activities in question.</PARA>
<PARA> We must be absolutely systematic and consistent in our reaction to events as they occur around the world. That is the position we take on human rights issues of all kinds, whether we otherwise have friendly or unfriendly relations with the government concerned. So it must be in the Middle East as elsewhere. I add, though, that the Australian Government deeply regrets the suffering of innocent civilians, both Palestinian and Jewish, resulting from these disturbances. We have stressed over and again that it is imperative that all parties renounce the use of violence of the kind that we have seen in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that, to ensure the safety and protection of the civilian population of the occupied territories, Israel must accept the de jure applicability of the fourth Geneva convention to the territories. We support fully the call on Israel to abide by the requirements of the convention, that is to say, to desist forthwith from policies and practices which are in violation of the provisions of the convention and to refrain from measures which clearly are causing growing frustration and antagonism in the territories. Lest there be any doubt about the balance of the Government's approach on this, I refer Senator Panizza to my answer to an earlier question today in which I expressed equally strong concern about Palestinian practices in the past and repeated the call this Government has made, in common with many others, for an unequivocal rejection of terrorism and similar forms of violence by the Palestinian side. Only when both sides are prepared to renounce violence, sit down around a conference table and hammer out an acceptable long term solution to this problem will we be able to avoid the necessity for this kind of debate in the future.</PARA>

<PARA>Parliamentary Question</PARA>
<PARA> Response to question asked by Senator McGauran on 24 November concerning Trade Practices Commission decision relating to South Australia newsagency distribution system.</PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday Senator McGauran asked me a question without notice concerning a recent decision by the Trade Practices Commission relating to newsagency distribution arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> I indicated at the time that I was not aware of the decision by the Trade Practices Commission to which Senator McGauran referred and that I would seek further information. As the Attorney-General has the responsibility for the Trade Practices Act I have sought his advice.</PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the particular concerns raised by Senator McGauran, I should say something briefly of the history of the Trade Practices Commission's consideration and examination of newsagency arrangements over recent years. As many Honourable Senators will recall, the Trade Practices Act of 1974 established an authorisation procedure whereby anti-competitive conduct, such as newsagency monopoly arrangements which would otherwise breach the Act, could be authorised by the Commission on public benefit grounds. Amongst the many applications for authorisation which followed the coming into force of the 1974 Act were applications in respect of various newspaper distribution arrangements in each State.</PARA>
<PARA> Pending an examination of those arrangements, the Commission granted interim authorisations. Since then, the Commission has progressively undertaken a detailed examination of each State. South Australia is the last State to be examined in detail and the Commission's decision of 14 November is the outcome of that examination.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commission's authorisation of the South Australian arrangements differs from those that it has made in relation to other States-and this is one respect in which the decision has attracted a good deal of attention-is that it removes the monopoly presently enjoyed by authorised newsagents in South Australia over retail sales. This aspect of the Commission's authorisation, coupled with its announcement that it will now undertake a national study of newsagency distribution arrangements, has led to some expressions of concern in other States that the retail sales monopolies presently authorised in those States will be also reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran has pointed to concerns by some family newsagency proprietors that any flow through of the South Australian decision to other States would have an adverse financial impact on the value of those businesses. It is worth noting in this regard, however, that there were many newsagents and other small retailers in South Australia who argued before the Commission that the monopoly should go.</PARA>
<PARA> For those who have these concerns I think it is necessary that attention be drawn to a number of important aspects of the Commission's authorisation in respect of South Australia and its decision to undertake a national study.</PARA>
<PARA> First, it needs to be borne in mind that the situation in South Australia differs from other States in regard to home deliveries which, in South Australia, are generally not tied to associated retail monopolies.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the authorisation in respect of South Australia provides for compensation to those newsagents who will be disadvantaged by loss of this retail monopoly. An independent committee is to oversight compensation payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point I would make is that the national study will be carried out under the general research provisions of the Trade Practices Act and will not of itself have any legal effect on the currently authorised newsagency arrangements in any one State. Moreover, I would expect the Trade Practices Commission in its usual way to welcome and encourage the making of submissions by interested persons, including of course parliamentarians and small business people such as family newsagency proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part the Government will follow the progress of the inquiry closely and give consideration to the making of its views known to the Commission. That will, of course, be a matter for the Attorney-General to consider in view of his responsibilities for the administration of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 November Senator Calvert asked me a question relating to the level of Federal road funding as a proportion of gross domestic product and the assistance provided to local government in meeting its responsibilities to construct and maintain local roads. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support has provided me with a lengthy supplementary answer which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure why Senator Calvert thinks there should be a link between road funding and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The fact is that the road funding record of this Government is a very good one. Over the past six budgets it has provided 21 per cent more in real terms than that provided under the last six budgets of the Fraser Government. He may also be interested to know that since the Hawke Government came to power GDP has grown by some 27 per cent in real terms compared with 12 per cent in real terms over the last six Fraser Budgets demonstrating better management of the economy. Even if the comparison is made of road funding as a proportion of GDP the record of this Government over the past six budgets is better than that of the previous six budgets of the Fraser Government. This is a significant achievement when considered against the more rapid growth in GDP under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senator seems to have mentioned only one side of the story when comparing the 1960s and the 1980s. The 1960s was a period of major export expansion for Australia, current economic circumstances imposed on Australia dictate a responsible approach to external debt management and therefore to Federal spending priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures available for the distribution of funding by level of Government are those published by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics for 1985-86. These figures indicate that Federal expenditure on roads was $1300 million (31.6 per cent), State expenditure $1516 million (36.8 per cent) and local government expenditure $1300 million (31.6 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Calvert asked a supplementary question on the proportion of fuel excise that is spent on local roads.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to this question is that fuel excise is used as a source of general revenue to fund things such as hospitals, schools, social welfare and defence at the Federal level. It also helps to fund general purpose assistance to the States and local government. Under the last six budgets of the Hawke Government general purpose assistance to local government has been 30 per cent higher in real terms than under the previous six budgets of the Fraser Government. In addition funding for local roads has been nearly 8 per cent higher in real terms using the same comparative period. This record indicates the importance this Government places on assisting local government to perform its role. This importance is further demonstrated by the fact that in 1988-89 Federal funding for local roads has been maintained in real terms over that provided in 1987-88.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday Senator Janet Powell asked me a question on the attendant care scheme. I am now in a position to answer the question. The attendant care scheme should not be regarded as simply an income security issue. The question of the income needs of people with disabilities has been addressed in a wide-ranging paper issued as part of Professor Bettina Cass's review of the social security system. Policy in that area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social Security. Attendant care for people with disabilities is intended to increase the general independence of those with high support needs who would otherwise be forced to live in inappropriately restrictive nursing homes. The current scheme, which aims to support 360 people by the end of a three-year period, was commenced only after a two-year pilot program in Sydney established the parameters of the scheme. I do not, therefore, understand the reference in the question to a three-years trial national scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to understand that extensive consultations were conducted throughout Australia before the eligibility guidelines were established. There was an overwhelming belief in a limited scheme. Preference had to be given to the special needs of those people who had spent considerable time in nursing homes, often for the aged, and who had been denied any opportunity of living in the community because of the severity of their disabilities. The decision was not arrived at lightly and it was taken in the knowledge that it would take time to organise appropriate support arrangements for individuals prepared to make the move out of nursing homes. The attendant care scheme commenced only in April 1987. It is true that it has taken longer than anticipated to arrange housing for some applicants, but this has not affected the funds provided, and budgeted for, to 360 people over three years.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already explained the rationale for the eligibility criteria. Until the needs of the target group are met there is no question of extending eligibility under the attendant care scheme. Other programs, such as the home and community care (HACC) scheme, which is cost-shared with State governments, are designed to cater for the needs of those who are living in the community. Any extension of HACC to better accommodate non-institutionalised people with disabilities would need to be agreed with State governments. Issues associated with the needs of younger disabled people are being discussed with State governments during the course of the national review of HACC. This is expected to report to the Council of Social Welfare Ministers next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, you and other honourable senators will be aware that later this session we will be debating a series of Bills relating to triticale. I have found there is a great deal of ignorance as to what triticale is. Some have thought it was a city in South America; some thought it was an exotic device. It is a most important and valuable primary product-a crop which is a cross between wheat and rye. So that honourable senators will be more informed when the Bills are debated, I have brought along a sample of the triticale plant to show the Senate. So that the Senate will remain informed about this important crop, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a full explanation of the plant and its uses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Triticale Notes</PARA>
<PARA> Triticale is the name of a cereal developed by crossing wheat and rye. Normally such a hybrid of these two cereals would be sterile. In 1948 the hybrid triticale was treated with the chemical agent colchicine which caused the chromosome number in each cell to double and enable it to become fertile. The resulting plant was octaploid, that is it contained sets of chromosomes. The parent rye plant was diploid (2 sets of chromosomes) and the parent bread making wheat was hexaploid (6 sets of chromosomes). Later durum wheat, a tetraploid wheat (4 chromosomes) was crossed with rye to produce a hexaploid triticale which is what most modern cultivars have been developed from. The name triticale is a hybrid of the genus name for wheat, Triticum, and the genus for rye, Secale. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many problems in developing a commercial crop. Early plants were tall like rye and susceptible to flattening in storms. The seed set and grain yields were poor and the seeds were prone to sprouting in humid climates. Triticale took too long to ripen in the tropics because it was developed in temperate areas where it required long day length to mature. </PARA>
<PARA> Research into these problems continued in different parts of the world. In 1967 researchers at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico developed a strain of triticale that was both short and not dependent upon a long day length to mature. The first triticale cultivar called Rosner was released in 1969 by the University of Manitoba in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> Triticale is more similar to wheat than rye in the appearance of the plant and the protein and starch content of the grain. It contains higher levels of the amino acid lysine which is relatively low in most cereals. Its bread making characteristics are better than those of rye but poorer than wheat in that pure triticale flour does not produce very light breads or pastries. It is used in animal feed and newer varieties don't appear to contain the anti nutritional factors found in the parent rye. </PARA>
<PARA> Under optimal conditions triticale can produce grain yields at similar levels to that of wheat. In 1974 triticale from a field in California produced 9890 kg/ha, which was comparable to yields of the best wheats. In 1985 average yields were in France were 6 tonnes/hectare (t/ha) but in the USA the average yields 2.5-4 t/ha and in Australia the yields averaged only 2 t/ha. </PARA>
<PARA> The differences in average yields may relate to the fact that triticale is often planted in more marginal areas where it is seen to have an advantage over wheat. It has been claimed that triticale has an advantage over the best breadwheats in highland areas, in acid soils and in areas where drought tolerance is needed. As well it was considered to be highly resistant to rusts. </PARA>
<PARA> However Australian experience doesn't bear all these claims out. There is no evidence that triticale varieties in Australia survive drier conditions better than wheat or that they are resistant to stem rusts. Under irrigation, yields of 6-7 t/ha have been achieved but at the cost of breakdown in disease resistance. Varieties of triticale have been shown to do well on heavy soils and in acids soils with aluminium levels. The acid soils are increasing in Australia so a crop capable of growing under these conditions is important. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the triticale in Australia came from the CIMMYT program in Mexico but some varieties have come from Eastern Europe to be used for dual purpose production of grazing the crop twice during winter and then growing out to grain with a slight loss in yield. The triticales from Eastern Europe and Canada grow in a protrate form during winter which allows them to be grazed with little damage to the plant's grain producing potential. There is still little planting of this winter habit in Australia. Often significant areas of triticale have been used for fodder production, especially in dry seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant commercial production of triticale commenced in the late 1970's. Initial varieties didn't meet the expectations of the farmers and after rapid expansion in the early years the area planted has stabilised over the the past few years. Newer varieties have been more acceptable. The area sown in Australia in 1986 was 148,000 ha and this yielded 270,000 tonnes. Yield of triticale has consistently lagged behind that of wheat in most years in NSW. As mentioned earlier this is probably due to major sowings in marginal conditions, especially in acid soils. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the triticale grown in Australia is used as animal feed, mainly for pigs and poultry. Some triticale is exported from WA to the Middle East but most is used on the domestic market. In 1983 only 50 tonnes of the 188,000 tonnes produced was used for human consumption. Triticale has a somewhat aromatic, nutty and sweet flavour, is a good source of fibre and can replace wheat flour for some people suffering from wheat allergies. It is cheaper than imported rye and can be used as a substitute in some products. Present uses are the incorporation of flakes in muesli, the use of flour and whole grains in specialty breadmaking and the manufacture of triticale macaroni. It still has not had wide community acceptance. </PARA>

Morale is at an all-time low, wastage rates are astronomically high and there is widespread dissatisfaction with conditions, both for serving personnel and for veterans. The Government's failures range from the petty to the profound. It still refuses to correct the 2 per cent discounted Defence Force retirement benefits; the repairs and maintenance budget for defence housing is appallingly low; some recommendations of the excellent Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses have yet to take real effect; and the Government, abetted to a degree by the Opposition, appears to be on a policy course which downgrades the status of veterans in our community. </PARA>

The fact that they are unimpressed is reflected in the current crises, especially in the resignation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> These factors and others, resulting from decades of neglect, not only by this Government by also by its predecessors, and a lack of imagination in the relevant portfolios are leading to the rapid disintegration of Australia's Defence Force. None of us want this. Some of us can see a clear solution. The Government has recently released several reports. I have here four substantial reports that have been released in the last 18 months to two years. These reports are ambivalent and contradictory documents which on the one hand acknowledge, yet on the other hand deny, the crises. None of these reports propose the type and scale of change that will redress the problems. I have here four reports. One, entitled The Management of Australia's Defence, was tabled in the Senate towards the end of last year and was acknowledged by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats as being an utter indictment of the management of our defence forces. The Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities was to be the foundation upon which a new, restructured and potent Australian Defence Force was to be modelled but, sadly, that is not proving to be the case. We have the recent Defence Report of 1987-88 and the document tabled in the Senate last week, entitled Personnel Wastage in Australia's Defence Forces-Report and Recommendations. The wastage phenomenon is the most indicative symptom of the utter devastation of our defence preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failures range, as I said, from the petty to the profound, and there has been much comment on them. The Australian Democrats believe that the only solution is to alter radically the structure and operation of our Defence Force. We live in a nuclear age, yet in an essentially peacekeeping country. Because of that we must shift our defence thinking, organisation and materiel from the offensive to the defensive and from the predominantly military model to the predominantly civil defence model. But under no circumstances must we allow ourselves to remain defenceless-the position in which we now find ourselves. As I said a moment ago, the most severe sympton of this defencelessness and the importance of our Defence Force lies and is recognised in the alarming level of personnel wastage from the Australian Defence Force. On page xxv of the foreword to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not support the Department of Defence's conclusion that wastage is of concern only in `some specific specialist areas'. That kind of assessment pays insufficient attention to the qualitative aspects of wastage, as well as understating the overall effect and extent of numerical losses. Our assessment is that there is cause for concern across a wide range of ranks and skills, in the following general and specific groups:</PARA>
<PARA> The report mentions male trainees, male officers, junior officers, project officers, Army corporals and senior non-commissioned officers, Royal Australian Navy Officers of the rank of commander and below, Navy engineers, Navy principal warfare officers, Navy technical sailors, Navy submariners, Army officers of the rank of major and below, signals corps officers, Army soldier specialist tradesmen, Royal Australian Air Force engineers, Air Force pilots, Air Force technical airmen, and flight engineers. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the aspects of our Defence Force personnel structure which it says are in tatters. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent and magnitude of wastage in some of those areas is such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course this document is a profound indictment of what has prevailed in the planning of our Defence Force, not only by this Government but by previous governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats advocate armed neutrality as being by far the most effective moral and appropriate position for our Government to adopt. Neutrality is a status recognised under international law. It is divided into transient and permanent neutrals. Permanent neutrals such as Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland, Austria and Finland must stay out of all wars and must follow policies in peacetime which enable them to do this. These countries cannot accept any obligation which would impair their neutrality in war. How would armed neutrality affect Australia? I quote from a paper on the subject by David Martin, author of a book called Armed Neutrality for Australia. He says that Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would have to withdraw from the ANZUS treaty. It could no longer station RAAF squadrons in Malaysia. It would have to end `defence arrangements'-which include the gift of arms and war material-with Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian units could not exercise with foreign fleets, armies or air forces, or grant overflight rights to American bombers. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could not be host to foreign or jointly-controlled military bases. No Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape `facilities'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could freely supply aid to anti-colonial movements in Africa, to Afghan resistance fighters, to Solidarity activists in Poland, but not if that aid could be misused for military purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could train foreign officers, so long as their countries are internally and externally at peace. It could not link itself to a trade grouping like ASEAN, which has strong military implications, but could enter an essentially trade-centred Pacific Community. </PARA>
<PARA>In developing his thesis concerning armed neutrality, he goes on to address other ways in which armed neutrality would affect Australia and to address the question of whether we would have to have conscripts to sustain a position of armed neutrality which was such that we would be able to protect ourselves adequately against foreseen threat. He answers the question profoundly by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> No, since we don't need million-strong forces to confront superpowers. In this, too, we are luckier than Sweden and Switzerland. Modern defence thinkers estimate that from 150,000 to 250,000 properly trained reserves are what we want. </PARA>
<PARA> We could get these by adopting the Voluntary Latent Service system, first detailed by Dr Ross Babbage. It relies on the voluntary annual enrolment of approximately 20,000 to 30,000 carefully chosen and well paid volunteers. They would undergo intensive training-not of uniform length, since different specialities demand different schedules-and return for updating courses in succeeding years. They would then become militarily trained civilians, a democratic, semi-professional militia. They would be under contract to answer a call-up within 14 days. </PARA>
<PARA> If they remained `on tap' for five years, we would have reserves of 150,000, if for eight years, 240,000 to flesh out our small standing army. The personnel would be sufficiently well paid and trained in specialties to make the service attractive to highly motivated people. The system would be adaptable, affordable, and easy to run. Training costs would be higher than now, but not if measured against the returns. There would be no rejects or drop-outs. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from David Martin. How would armed neutrality affect Australia?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. If Australia became a permanently neutral country we would not need to be totally self-supporting, although we would naturally follow the same policies we have now of becoming self-reliant as far as possible and as to the manufacture and maintenance of defence capital equipment and materiel. Although other neutral countries such as Switzerland and Sweden find that they have to rely upon conscription to provide the numbers of Defence Force personnel they need, we are in a more fortunate position strategically than they are. We should be able to get by with an increased Defence Force through voluntary enlistment as well as a well-trained reserve of 150,000 to 250,000 committed, well-trained reservists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Armed neutrality is a realistic, sensible step for Australia to take. New Zealand is already moving in that direction. The sooner it is given genuine, detailed consideration, the better. Of course by far the most controversial, aspect of armed neutrality is the concept of non-alignment. It is important not to confuse non-alignment with isolation. The former in no way implies the latter, and to argue that it does would be dim-witted, stagnant thinking and again unimaginative. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months in this chamber I have attempted to project some new thinking into the area of defence. We must move towards new integrated models of defence based upon both civil and military defence thinking, models which would provide for increased and substantially improved morale within the Services by making their tasks more relevant and visible. Many Western European countries employ their defence forces in non-military tasks. One example is Austria, which employs her defence forces in mountain and air-sea rescue, as frontier police, for disaster relief, as police reinforcements and for fire control reinforcement. Similar undertakings are typical of the Belgian civil military defence forces. In Denmark they undertake mountain and air-sea rescue, coastguard work, and disaster relief. In Finland they undertake mountain and air-sea rescue, coastguard work, frontier police work, disaster relief, and reinforce police and fire control authorities. I could go on to illustrate what happens in Greece, West Germany, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, all of whom have a much more modern approach to the structuring of their armed forces than we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald honourable senators will have read further revelations of the continuing debacle of our coastal surveillance program. The whole area of coastal surveillance is one which could and should be handled by our defence forces. Honourable senators might recall that in January of this year the appropriate Senate committee called for submissions on coastal surveillance. Senator Coulter and I made one such submission in which we made proposals which we believed were forward thinking. To this stage they have not been acknowledged as even having been submitted to the committee. I will now quote from a part of our submission to that committee. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The problem of protecting the lawful integrity of our territorial sea, especially its northern portion is just one to which the solution suggested here would make a major contribution. We believe the need for `northern surveillance' so-called has been improperly analysed and wrongly perceived. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of over-the-horizon radar has meant or will shortly mean that most `surveillance' will be conducted without physically going and looking. On the contrary physically going and looking at a vessel engaged in an illegal activity merely tends to frighten it back to international waters. If the only method of interception remains naval patrols which take some days to reach the position of the sighting, little is achieved for a great deal of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>In the submission that we made to the joint committee we went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is argued here that a rapid and effective interception capability is the primary requirement and that the Canadian CL 215 amphibious aircraft meets such a requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other national problems to which this aircraft could make a very significant contribution. The cost of these aircraft make it unwise to purchase them for one purpose only. However, using them for the multiple purposes outlined here would make their acquisition quite cheap. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problems to which the CL 215 offers significant solutions are:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Sea rescue including retrieval of persons from offshore installations, islands and ships for medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Maintenance of offshore installations-lights, buoys, drilling rigs. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Bushfire and fire fighting. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Maintenance of a naval air arm. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Greater peace-time role for military forces and consequently better rapport between military and civilian personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on to comprehensively propose the purchase and use of the Canadian CL 215 in just one of the numerous civil-military defence roles which clearly should be undertaken by our newly structured defence forces. The Government's approach has been to pass this vital role to private companies which are now squabbling over this prize and employed in legal action between themselves and against the Federal Government. Clearly such a role is one for a new wave defence force suitably equipped with the Canadian CL 215 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats argue that we are facing an unprecedented defence crisis. It must be addressed now and it can best be resolved by profound lateral and bold rethinking of how best to reorganise our defence, both civil and military. We therefore call upon the Government immediately to establish a task force which objectively examines alternative defence models such as those that I have cited, which are widely spread and in use in overseas countries, and ensures the adequacy of Australia's civil and military defence now and into the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a Government member to speak on this motion moved by the Australian Democrats. At the outset I wish to indicate that an amendment which will be moved on behalf of the Opposition by Senator Newman when she speaks, is acceptable to the Government. I will leave Senator Newman to explain the details of that amendment. I must say that this motion could be more seriously treated if it did not attempt to do everything in both defence and foreign affairs and be everything to everybody in the world. I really find it extraordinary that at one level it calls for increased expenditure on defence armaments and for services to the defence forces and yet in paragraph 5 it calls for a reduction in expenditure. I cannot see how it can call for independent, non-aligned, neutral defence forces in Australia without having a substantial increase in defence expenditure. I believe that that is the great weakness of this urgency motion and that is why I will be opposing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make some comments about why we in the Australian Labor Party (ALP) support the general Western alliance and, in particular, our alliance with the United States of America. It has been the policy of the Labor Party since 1942; it has been generally debated in our Party on many occasions; and, on every occasion, the overwhelming majority has supported Australia staying a part of the Western alliance and the American alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the superficiality of the Australian Democrats' motion calling for a neutral, non-aligned Australia has to be carefully examined. Although it may give them a warm inner glow and may give some people in sections of our community a chance to beat a hairy chest about how strong Australia can be, it does not deal with a couple of fundamental positions that Australia faces in the world. First of all, we have to accept that Australia is a democracy. The Western alliance is overwhelmingly made up of countries that are committed to the same cultural, political, social and economic values as is Australia. It would be very difficult for Australia culturally to align itself with a large number of countries of the Third World which are one-party states, which in some cases are totalitarian and which in many cases have human rights abuses that we in Australia rightly condemn. But if we talk about neutrality and non-alignment, as is suggested by the Democrats, presumably we would be applying to join the non-aligned movement or the third force in global politics. Even if Australian people were interested in that proposition, when they saw the cost to Australia, not only politically but also economically, they would reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean talked about the way in which Australia could have a non-aligned, neutral Defence Force. He said we could do this by having what I would describe as a militia of 150,000 people. That would mean a substantially increased cost to the Australian defence budget. He raised all these matters because he could not get over the great weakness of his argument: if we want a neutral, non-aligned Australia, completely separated from any other alliances, we will have to create a much larger defence force in order to convince the Australian people that we are capable of defending ourselves. The only way to do that would be to introduce conscription which is the case in countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. We could not avoid it. I do not believe that it is necessary to have conscription in a country such as Australia. Once we went down the road to conscription and a much greater defence capability we would be starting to develop a military industrial complex that would end up leading us into ventures such as the Vietnam war. One of the reasons the Americans went into the Vietnam war was that they had developed a large military industrial complex-something that President Eisenhower warned against in one of his last major speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Democrats want increased government expenditure and taxpayers resources going into the Defence Force, they should say so. They should also bite the bullet and say that they would introduce conscription. </PARA>

Senator McLean in his speech used examples of other countries that we can look to. He said that Sweden has been neutral for a long time. There is much that I admire about Swedish society; much of it is an example that we in Australia can look to. But when we talk about neutrality in Sweden we should not forget that, during the Second World War, although Sweden was neutral it had no objection to large amounts of its iron ore being sold to the nazis in Germany-iron ore that was used to make weapons and to build concentration camps.</PARA></TALK.START>

But Senator McLean has used Sweden as an example of the way we should go. He has said that it is neutral and non-aligned and referred to its moral position. There is much that I admire about Sweden but it should not be forgotten when Sweden sold iron ore all through the Second World War to the nazi war machine. I point out also that, in 1940, when Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union, the Swedes did nothing to help their fellow Scandinavians. They sat by and stayed neutral when a country was overtly attacked and suffered much in that war. Senator McLean also used the example of Switzerland.

It has atomic weapons and it refuses to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean might not like it but I am trying to explain to him that, when he raised his wonderful examples of neutral and non-aligned countries, he should have looked very closely at their foreign and defence policies. India, a major force in the non-aligned movement, has nuclear weapons. It has policies on nuclear weapons that I trust the honourable senator's Party would totally oppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another country that plays a big part in the non-aligned movement is Cuba. Whatever we may say about the success of the Castro revolution in 1959, which got rid of the very nasty, right wing, corrupt Batista regime, unfortunately in the last 15 years Cuba has acted as the de facto armed forces for Soviet foreign policy in various parts of the world. It stands up and says that it is a member of the non-aligned movement, yet it has armed forces in various parts of the world. I mentioned in the Senate only three weeks ago that I was in Eritrea in Ethiopia in October. Guess who helps the Ethiopian regime and advises that regime in a military capacity to bomb defenceless citizens and civilians in Eritrea? It is Cuban military advisers based in Ethiopia. So we have another example of a country that is neutral and non-aligned but has policies that all right-minded people, including, I hope, the Democrats, would disagree with. So the Democrats should not tell us that being neutral and non-aligned is the wonderful way to be in the world because, unfortunately, there are overwhelming examples of neutrality and non-alignment in international politics having been the opposite of what the Democrats have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the Democrats' great difficulty in explaining to the people why we will not have to have conscription to provide a defence force capable of showing that, even though we are not a party to the Western alliance, we can defend ourselves. Until Senator McLean addresses that position with clarity for the Australian people, urgency motions such as the one he moved today will be a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean also attacked the present Government over its defence policies, and I presume that Opposition speakers will accuse us of being deficient in some areas of defence. I want to put on the record the opinion that people should recognise that the Australian Labor Party in government has usually done more for the defence capability of this country, going right back to the Fisher Government. Despite conservative opposition in 1910 and 1911 it established an independent Royal Australian Navy. During the Second World War it was the Australian Labor Party that had to takeover the government of this country when the conservative government of the day ended up as a rabble and could not carry out Australia's war effort against nazism in the world. Our defence achievements have always been to enhance our defence self-reliance. In only five years we have done a number of things to establish-and I hope Senator McLean would appreciate this-a defence force that can look after the defence of Australia in the general context of our alliance arrangements. For example, instead of buying submarines off the shelf overseas at considerable cost to our balance of trade we are going to build submarines in Australia-I am pleased to say in my State. It will give us a long range strike capability which will be one of the best in our region. We have continued the decision of the previous Government to purchase F18s which, again, improves our long range strike capability. We decided to introduce in-flight refuelling, to update the F111 which also has the strike capacity of the PC3 Orions. We have a strike capacity in our region that is our first level of defence. I would think all of those achievements are ones that the Democrats would not try to besmirch but would welcome as an ongoing development. We do have a self-reliant defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to foreign affairs. One paragraph of the motion refers to a strong nuclear free stance. The Democrats should sometimes give us some credit. I am not saying that they should give it all the time; I understand politics. They have to appeal to their own base to achieve their quotas to get elected, but I thought it would have been quite reasonable to mention and to give credit to the achievements of this Government over the last five years. Firstly, we signed the nuclear free treaty for the South Pacific. That is an achievement which Senator McLean and the Democrats have done nothing but harp on, saying that it has not gone far enough. If it were not for a Labor government there would not be any Australian involvement in a nuclear free zone in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not hear the Democrats congratulating this Government for the fact that at every United Nations General Assembly meeting each year for the last four years it has proposed a comprehensive test ban treaty on nuclear weapons. I point out to Senator McLean that in that last vote, which was only a few weeks ago, on a motion sponsored by Australia and New Zealand, 127 countries voted in favour, six abstained and only two were against. That was an initiative of this Government in the United Nations which has given us and the Australian people a recognition around the world that we are leaders in achieving nuclear disarmament. I just wish that occasionally the Democrats would give us some respect for that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats say that we are totally obligated to the Americans in foreign policy. I point out to the Democrats that although we are part of an alliance with America and the general Western alliance, there are a significant number of foreign affairs issues on which we have publicly disagreed with the Americans. They know it; we know it. We have explained that our relationship with the Americans is a mature relationship, and we do disagree. An example of that was shown today at Question Time when Senator Gareth Evans put on record the Australian Government's disagreement with the Americans in refusing to give a visa to Yasser Arafat to visit New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. It is on the record that we disagreed on an issue to which America is extremely sensitive. I would like to list for Senator McLean some of the areas where we have disagreed with the Americans over the last five years. We have from time to time expressed our opposition to America's policy on Central America, particularly as it relates to Nicaragua. We have supported the Contradore policy. On most of those occasions I never saw any Democrat spokesmen making a public statement in support of the Government's position when it opposed the American policy on Central America. I do not see too many Democrats jumping up and down supporting us. In 1983-84 when Bill Hayden was attempting a very courageous initiative to get a settlement in Kampuchea, which was in contradiction to American policy and to the Association of South East Asian Nations policy, the Democrats did not support us. We tried very hard. It is only now that much of what Bill Hayden was putting forward is proving to be correct. As I said, we disagreed with America on Kampuchea. We disagreed with the Americans over the strategic defence initiative. We made it quite clear that we thought it was unnecessary and that it was destabilising. We disagreed with the Americans over the MX missile proposal in 1984. In 1983 when the Americans invaded Grenada we indicated that we did not support that invasion and the way it was carried out. </PARA>

If Senator McLean's policy were put into effect the Democrats would be the moralising irrelevant group in Australia of which no-one would take any notice. If they want to have Australia made irrelevant in the world as a middle sized power we will carry these sorts of nonsensical contradictory motions. The Democrats keep putting them up; we will keep knocking them down. They are irrelevant to the strategic defence and foreign affairs policy needs of Australia. I hope that at some time in the near future the Democrats will try to come to terms with the fact that Australia is a middle sized power with an independent foreign policy, with a self-sufficient defence force. If this sort of junk motion were carried it would mean at one level that we would cut defence expenditure and at another level we would be asked to have an independent, non-aligned defence force. The Democrats want-and it will never work-a pacifist defence force and an aggressive foreign affairs policy. I do not think the Democrats can have it that way. If we want to be influential around the world we have to participate in multilateral affairs at all levels. We have to negotiate with people in the diplomatic area. We also have to back it up with a self-reliant defence force; not with the pie in the sky that the Democrats want, which is to cut expenditure and then say, `We want a neutral and non-aligned Australia'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 February this year in an earlier debate on defence policy an honourable senator said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A long time ago I reached the conclusion that politicians should not be the formulators of defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The speaker on that occasion was Senator McLean. If ever I agreed with him I agreed with him on that statement. When one looks at what he has put forward here as the Australian Democrats' policy for defending Australia, I am appalled to think that this simplistic and irrelevant nonsense could come from the pen of a former serviceman, an officer in the Australian Regular Army. I am very disappointed. I could not believe that Senator McLean could allow the Democrats to continue to live in cloud-cuckoo-land as he has done. What Senator McLean in his urgency motion is saying is that we need to fix up all the problems in our Defence Force which boil down to money, morale and effectiveness, and to do that we have to aim for a force which can defend us when we are attacked, but we have to do so without any assistance from our friends which means that neither our friends nor ourselves have any nuclear capacity. The Opposition is very supportive of the Democrats when they recognise the problems in the Defence Force today. The Opposition does not, however, go along with them when they suggest ways of dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that the urgency motion was framed in the terms that it was, because clearly if Senator McLean had chosen other words we could have supported him thoroughly. In the past he has supported my urgency motions with regard to the effect of the Government's run-down of the defence capacity of this nation. But he has combined our genuine concerns about the morale and the effectiveness of our Defence Force with this incomprehensible approach taken in this motion, which states that expenditure on armaments is likely to increase the likelihood of global conflicts. He wants to turn our defence forces into some kind of mother's milk peace corps. His motion refers to the maintenance of a strong nuclear free stance and the bringing of Australia to a position of armed neutrality. For goodness sake, that cannot be the country that I think is worth defending. Senator McLean is a former Army officer. I wonder where he got all that garbage from. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, by way of their motion, urge us to support their demands for a unilateral disarmament of the democracies while our enemies can retain their offensive capacities to their heart's content. The Opposition utterly rejects this as a dangerous approach to the defence of this country and one which will undermine our defence capacity. Senator Schacht has already referred to the amendment which I hope to move. I foreshadow the use of a contingent notice of motion which will affirm the maintenance of our alliances, particularly those with the United States, and reject a unilateral approach to disarmament and arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> Having recognised, by implication, that we are having trouble with the effectiveness of our defence forces through a lack of resources and mobility and the dilution of experience, the Democrats would have them take an even greater role in fire fighting, emergency services, rescue, coastal patrols, drug surveillance, et cetera. To cap it off, they would redirect expenditure away from armaments, which they claim increase the likelihood of conflict, as I said before. I reiterate that that is an infantile and simplistic approach to matters of enormous national moment. I am glad that Senator Schacht talked about the irrelevance and superficiality of that approach. I welcome the Government's support for my amendment. I look forward to it placing on the record the need to maintain our alliances and not go down that unilateralist disarmament path. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me place on the record what is the situation in our defence forces. As I said earlier, the motion contains a few sentiments which we would have supported had they not been surrounded by so much nonsense. Our defence forces do lack a surveillance capacity. We have problems in seeing what shipping comes into our waters. As we know only too well, we constantly have uninvited visitors. We have problems with planes travelling in our air space, and we are lucky if we find out about it afterwards. We have a lack of capability in getting our forces over beaches. We need to increase our amphibious capability. We have constrained establishments. When the Government does not have enough manpower to meet the jobs to be done, it just writes down how many men it will need, and then it does not look as though it is managing quite so badly. We need to deal with the problems of constrained establishments and low manning levels. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have sufficient air cover for our ships when they travel further out to sea. That means that we will not have protection for our trade in times of harassment or war. We have a lack of protection for our infantry. We would have to send them in without air cover or artillery cover. It is a dangerous and disgraceful exercise to send in light infantry without the sort of back-up needed. One of our most serious problems-the others are more noticeable, but this will be a long term problem-is that we have too high a proportion of men with too little experience. The Opposition has been trying to warn the Government about this matter for a couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that a couple of weeks ago the Cross report-a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-was handed down. It said that the present level of wastage in our defence forces is substantially too high and has been for some time. It also stated that that would be a most dangerous practice to allow one key element of our defence capabilities to degrade past a certain level. We need to implement all actions simultaneously; that is, we need to maintain capital equipment; we need to maintain our operational capacity; and we need to maintain our personnel levels. I have dealt with the issue of morale in the past. I do not have time today to go into it in great detail. It relates to the problem of job satisfaction, the problems of pay and allowances, and the problems of bureaucratic management of the Defence Force. It relates to the lack of political and service leadership and to the need for improvement in family well-being. It even concerns the problems of lack of personal equipment for servicemen doing the job. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion states that the dimensions of the crises involve economics. The defence budget this year was $7.6m. Of that, 29.1 per cent was spent on capital equipment, only 43 per cent was spent on personnel, and operating costs are supposed to represent 27.9 per cent. Earlier Senator Schacht referred to the shopping list of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) which would be fine if it were not being achieved at the expense of our personnel and their operational costs. Let me remind the Senate that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation talks about running costs of 8c per person per day. We are prepared to spend only $1.25 per person per day to defend the country. Mr Dibb recommended expenditure of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. We are not spending anything like that, but for an extra 10c per person per day we could reach that amount. We are prepared to spend $3.80 per person per day on social security. I leave honourable senators to draw their own conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA> We need to shift the balance in the defence forces. It is not good enough to cancel exercises for the rest of this year and to cancel promotional courses. There will be a shortage of 750 corporals this year. People are not being promoted to corporal because we cannot afford the money to train them for their promotional exams. Adventurous training is also being cancelled. Army vehicles are being put off the road for one day a week for the rest of this year so as to deal with the fuel bill. As I said the other day, the Government has even cut out parsley from the meals provided to personnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very interested to know whether Senator McLean has anything positive to say, because he talked a great deal of waffle. I would rather tell the Senate that there are problems with flying hours with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). We are unable to provide any more live firing support by the RAAF for the Army. There are problems with insufficient equipment and training. We are cancelling training. These are pretty serious matters. The Opposition would have supported the Australian Democrats if that is what their motion had been restricted to. But the Democrats have gone on with a great deal of nonsense. Soldiers are short of combat rations, compasses, binoculars, 7.62 mm linked ammunition, shells, mortar ammunition, and radio sets. There is a shortage of unimog trucks, telephone sets and night vision devices-to mention only a few items. This is a disgraceful exhibition by the Government. We would have been happy to join with the Democrats in supporting the motion condemning this situation. However, this motion which Senator McLean has brought forward is totally unacceptable for the reasons I mentioned earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to make sure that our servicemen are competent. They will be really competent only if they have been able to stay in the forces after about six years' training. That is not happening now. We need to be able to take the M113 project off the backburner and ensure that servicemen get to their destinations with protection. Black Hawk helicopters are not enough to protect them; we need the M113s as well. We need to take the landing craft out of mothballs. We need to fully utilise the amphibious capacity of HMAS Tobruk. We have to make sure that the Navy is flexible and can get out to sea with appropriate air cover. We need to be able to refuel the FA18s and the F111s if we are to achieve maximum flexibility of our Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to what could be the outcome of the Democrats' motion. Let us look at the capacity in the Warsaw Pact countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) countries. The nuclear deterrent has managed to achieve peace in spite of the fact that there is an enormous discrepancy between conventional equipment and weapons production in the Warsaw Pact countries and the NATO countries. At the moment-this came out of the statement on the Defence Estimates by the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defense just recently-the figure for the main battle tanks for the Warsaw Pact is 28,900, and for NATO it is 11,500; the figure for other armoured vehicles for the Warsaw Pact is 48,500, and for NATO it is 19,150; the Warsaw Pact figure for field artillery, mortars and rocket launchers is 32,550, and for NATO it is 6,550; the figure for technical combat and interceptor aircraft for the Warsaw Pact is 9,400, and for NATO it is 6,750. The ability to stay at peace despite those enormous discrepancies in arsenals is what the nuclear deterrent has managed to achieve for us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no intention of cutting off Australia's future defence options. I am glad that Senator Evans, in the debate on 4 November on my motion about the visits of nuclear warships, said that United States military support would be forthcoming and mentioned how important it was to the Government. I have no time to direct the Senate's attention to further quotations on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a question of covering our own backs in having these alliances. It is our responsibility as part of the global network of seeking and contributing to world peace. It is something I had hoped the Australian Democrats would have had some sympathy for. Senator Evans, in the debate I mentioned earlier, was very specific when he said that these alliances do improve our ability to defend our region. It improves our credibility. It is not just a question of looking after Australia. Our region is the stronger for maintaining those alliances. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean should know better than most people that the Defence Force cannot spread its efforts too far and too thinly. The hours that our servicemen already work are too long. They work about 58 hours a week, and service personnel leave the Defence Force as a result. Senator McLean should know that the maintenance of the aim is a principle of war. In other words, keep it simple stupid-which might apply to the Democrats in trying to teach them how to approach a defence matter. We should not divert our efforts from the main goal, which is to defend Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In referring again to the Democrats' unilateralist line, I point out that they say that by being well armed we are increasing the likelihood of global conflicts. The truth is that history has proved them wrong over and over again. People died in the Second World War because of those policies. At the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) and pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be addressing my remarks specifically to points 3 and 5 in Senator McLean's urgency motion. In the debate several days ago on foreign bases on Australian soil, I developed the argument that a dependence on nuclear weapons is counter-productive. A nuclear defence is no defence, firstly, because one cannot use it and, secondly, because dependence on nuclear weapons diverts enormous resources from other non-nuclear options, including spending more on foreign aid to reduce international tension. It thus leaves Australia more vulnerable to attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has come to rely heavily and, the Democrats believe, foolishly on close links with the American military machine. The Americans have aggressively nuclearised their military capability. Australia has therefore come to rely on nuclear weapons for the defence of this country should there be an attack on us beyond the mere trivial. It is extremely unlikely that the United States of America could or would come to our aid unless the United States itself was under threat. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out repeatedly, and as our Government has now conceded, the presence of US bases makes Australia a first strike nuclear target. Senator Newman naively suggested the other night-I think she has repeated this implication today-that we must make ourselves a nuclear target in order to prove our friendliness to the United States. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in the same debate repeatedly misrepresented our position as unilateral disarmament. One of the reasons for today's debate is to explain that armed neutrality is not, in any sense, disarmament. Armed neutrality is not disarmament any more than Sweden, also pursuing a position of armed neutrality, is disarmed. The position we are putting is this: a non-nuclear, effective, non-aligned, defensive-in contrast to offensive-military capability with integration of the civil and military roles of the defence forces and with greater emphasis on targeted foreign aid so as to reduce international tensions and reduce the possibility of armed conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that, far from destabilising a precarious balance between superpowers with itchy fingers and fallible computers poised above nuclear buttons, the adoption of this position-the position we are proposing-by a progressively larger number of countries would make it easier for the superpowers to negotiate an arms reduction. We reject as a non sequitur the claim that, because there has not been an armed conflict between superpowers in the last 40 years, mutually assured destruction, or MAD, was the only way this could have been achieved. We point to the hundreds of wars and armed conflicts throughout the world over this period of 40 years, which have been caused and exacerbated by the profligate diversion of resources by the industrial world into armaments. It has certainly not been peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim by Senator MacGibbon the other night, that the placing of short range nuclear rockets in Europe was the only strategy that could lead to the recent arms reduction agreement on these weapons, is another non sequitur. As for the argument that the world has been peaceful since 1945, in that time there have been approximately 130 wars, with casualties of between 19.5 million and 21 million people. Since 1945 the frequency of war has been increasing. So, at present there are 40 wars or armed conflicts in progress. Some peace since 1945!</PARA>
<PARA> It is our strong contention that the policy we espouse, if adopted by Australia and progressively promoted to and adopted by other nations, would make for a more peaceful world. An important component of that strategy is to swing more resources into targeted foreign aid so as to reduce the causes of war. According to the United Nations group of government experts on the relationship between disarmament and developments:</PARA>
<PARA>There can no longer be the slightest doubt that resource scarcities and ecological stresses constitute real and imminent threats to the future well-being of all people and nations. These challenges are fun- damentally non-military and it is imperative that they be addressed accordingly. If this is not recognised, . . . there is a grave risk that the situation will deteriorate to the point of crisis where, even with lower probability of success, the use of force could be seen as a way to produce results quickly enough. This is far from being a remote possibility. In recent years, there has been a marked tendency in international relations to use or to threaten to use military force in response to non-military challenges to security. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, the diversion of resources by the industrialised world to military purposes is directly impoverishing the underdeveloped world and increasing the risk of armed conflict. Global military spending is now well in excess of $1,000 billion. That is a million million dollars a year. This is more than the total income of the poorest half of humanity. It represents the equivalent of almost $1,000 for every one of the world's one billion poorest people. </PARA>
<PARA> Put another way, military spending surpassed the combined gross national products of China, India and the African countries south of the Sahara. Moreover, global military spending has risen not only absolutely but also proportionately, from an estimated 4.7 per cent of world output in 1960 to over 6 per cent, representing an increase of over 150 per cent in real or constant price terms. Three-quarters of current expenditure is in the industrialised world. The true cost of the arms race is the loss of what could have been produced instead with scarce capital, labour skills and raw materials. The plants that manufacture weapons, the transport of these weapons and the mining of minerals for their production all place enormous demands on energy and mineral resources and are a major contributor to pollution and environmental deterioration. </PARA>
<PARA> The distorting effects of the arms culture is most striking in the deployment of scientific personnel. Half a million scientists are employed on weapons research worldwide, and they account for around half of all research and development expenditure. This exceeds the total combined spending on developing technologies for new energy sources, improving human health, raising agricultural productivity and controlling pollution. Military research and development-$70 billion to $80 billion worldwide in 1984-is growing at twice the rate of military spending as a whole. At the same time there is a paucity of resources available for monitoring global climatic change; for surveying the ecosystems of disappearing rainforests and spreading deserts, and for developing agricultural technologies appropriate for rain-fed tropical agriculture. The US Agency for International Development reported that El Salvador-what a cruel irony that name has proved to be-is one of the most environmentally impoverished nations, with some of the worst soil erosion rates in the region. I quote that report:</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental causes of the present conflict are as much environmental as political, stemming from problems of resource distribution in an overcrowded land. </PARA>
<PARA>President Eisenhower observed at the end of his term in office that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired represent, in the final analysis, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, who are cold and not clothed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, of course, no military solutions to environmental insecurity. As I said a moment ago, the world is spending over $1 trillion a year-or more than $3,000m every day-on military purposes. An action plan for tropical forests would cost $1.3 billion a year over five years. This annual sum is the equivalent of half a day's military expenditure worldwide. Implementing the United Nations action plan for desertification would cost $4.5 billion a year during the last two decades of this century-the equivalent of less than two days of military spending. One of the greatest environmental hazards in the Third World is lack of clean water for household use, contributing to 80 per cent of disease. The United Nations Water and Sanitation Decade, although given only a small fraction of the support needed, would have cost $30 billion a year during the 1980s. This is the approximate equivalent of 10 days of military spending. To supply contraceptive materials to all women already motivated to use family planning would cost an additional $1 billion per year on top of the $2 billion spent today. This additional $1 billion is the equivalent of 10 hours of military spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Four of the most urgent global environmental requirements relating to tropical forests, water, desertification and population could be funded with the equivalent of less than one month's global military spending. Much of the industrialised world has become a prisoner of its own arms race. It is time Australia broke out of this prison. We could contribute far more both to our own security and to the security of the world as a whole were we to do so. </PARA>

<PARA> In the short time I have available this afternoon I want to go through a little of the history of Australian security requirements. I start with the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities in 1985 and the aims behind it and I will go on to talk about points (2) and (3) in the urgency motion. I think the aim behind the commissioning of the Dibb report in 1985 was to establish a comprehensive overall approach to Australian defence that would implement the principle of defence self-reliance. The Dibb review drew together all the separate considerations of self-reliance over the last decade and a half and proposed an achievable and cost-effective future policy. The review said that the prime national task of the Defence Force should be the defence of what it called our area of direct military interest, which if defined is the whole of the Australian land mass and its approaches out to about 1,000 nautical miles. The review went on to describe the basic elements of a capability to defend this area of direct military interest: a comprehensive surveillance and interdiction capacity in the north and across the whole span of our northern approaches; aerial mobility for the ground force; a greater commitment of defence resources in northern Australia; the establishment across the continent of proper infrastructure and support for the Defence Force; and greater use of reserves in meeting our immediate defence requirements and as a base for expansion. These capabilities will provide us with the capacity to meet the credible forms of military threat that could arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dibb review set down our defence priorities-Australian defence priorities. It proposed a system of secure defence for this country, not on the basis of what other countries wanted or needed, but based on a consideration of the most credible threats to Australia and the capabilities needed to counter these sorts of threats. At a time of economic difficulty-to put it mildly-for Australia, at a time when we have a particular responsibility to the Australian electorate properly to order our defence priorities, the Government believed that the Dibb review gave us the means of doing so, based on the pretty fundamental principles of self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 David Martin, the author of Armed Neutrality for Australia?, said in discussing Australia's capacity for self-reliance that Australian forces lacked three basic essentials: first, a structure flexible enough to meet the challenge of continental defence; secondly, enough trained reserves to provide a surge capacity in the event of hostile escalation; and, thirdly, means of effectively integrating these reserves into the regular forces. Whether that analysis was appropriate in 1984 is debatable. Certainly, it could not be asserted in the post-Dibb era. The scheme of capabilities proposed in the Dibb review, essentially drawing on existing resources with some modification, provides a comprehensive capacity for continental defence and in particular emphasises the fundamental place of the reserves in our security planning. The Dibb approach is one of comprehensive defence in depth-over the horizon radar and possibly airborne early warning aircraft for surveillance of our northern approaches; FA18s, F111s, submarines and surface elements of the Navy for intercepting threats in our approaches; a mobile army readily deployable across Australia; and reserve units trained for surveillance, northern defence, and the maintenance of expansion skills in tank warfare and medium artillery. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian defence doctrine in future years will bear a strong resemblance to that which was detailed. The review identifies capabilities essential for proper self-reliance and central to a responsible Australian defence policy. As outlined in the review, defence self-reliance is here to stay. Australia has an obligation both to itself and to its region to build a defence force with a basic capacity for self-defence. The Government believes that an Australian Defence Force which is able to deal effectively with the least unlikely challenges to this nation's sovereignty will contribute substantively to the continued stability of our region. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious factor arguing against neutrality or non-alignment is our self-interest in maintaining the American alliance. Non-alignment or neutrality would, of course, abrogate our formal ties with the US. A security alliance is only meaningful if, as well as representing some commonality in attitude, both parties have the necessary day to day self-interest to preserve it. From Australia's point of view it is the cost saving benefits of the US alliance that make defence self-reliance for Australia affordable. Fundamental to the effective development of a self-reliant defence force is comprehensive, intelligence cover of our area of primary strategy interest. Whilst we possess significant indigenous capabilities in this field, it is access to complementary US intelligence, and particularly access to US satellite intelligence, which we could not afford to duplicate, that assures to us a comprehensive knowledge of regional developments relevant to our security. This confidence in our regional intelligence cover allows us to order our defence priorities according to credible threats and the timescale in which they could develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the other major cost-saving element of the alliance, many of the most important items in the Defence Force's inventory are purchased in the United States. The FA18s, FFG frigates and F111s are a few examples, and other vital capabilities, such as the indigenous Jindalee OTH radar, draw heavily on our access to US research and experience. By virtue of the alliance we have access to the latest military technology and hardware. The availability of US military technology means, effectively, that our Defence Force will remain a qualitative jump ahead in regional terms for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other difficult to quantify area that emerges as an indirect benefit of our alliance relationship. This relates to what might be termed the insurance and attrition element of an armed and neutral posture. At a minimum we would require a major increase in the permanent store of key war stocks, including difficult to store precision guided munitions. Were resupply from an ally in doubt, this would be essential. Israel's experiences in this regard in 1973 are indicative and instructive. More costly in the insurance area would be the additional requirement for multiples of our major equipments. What we have now is probably enough, but a successful pre-emptive attack on our forces could start to make 100 front line aircraft and 14 warships seem rather paltry. Certainly Australians would never be convinced that we had enough in these circumstances. Access to ready resupply from an ally largely eliminates this concern from Australian debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, though we encourage defence manufacture and export, our policy now maintains a disciplined relationship between our industrial base and our contemporary requirement with a limited expansion capacity for war time. To be self-sufficient in our defence effort, particularly in high technology areas, would require a massive injection of funds. If honourable senators do not like how we now look as a defence exporter, think of what we might look like if we went into a Swedish defence industry mode. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost-limiting aspects of the US alliance are a major stumbling block for alternative theories such as armed neutrality. One proponent of this strategy for Australia, David Martin, has estimated that a one per cent rise in the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to defence annually would be sufficient for Australia to replace from its own resources the benefits inherent in the US alliance. Even assuming that he is correct, and there are reservations about an increase as small as that, when seen against the 2.9 per cent share of GDP defence currently receives, that one per cent increase adds up to $3 billion per year. Whilst there is longstanding majority support in Australia for an effective defence force, there would be a real question of community acceptance-to put it mildly-should the Government propose such an increase for defence. In addition, some vital capabilities, such as access to US satellite intelligence and military know-how, simply could not be replaced by greater government outlay. It would not be possible, even with the allocation of all our budgetary resources. The alliance with the US is thus vital to our capability to achieve a self-reliant defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> That is far from the alliance's only contribution to our security. The US alliance and joint facilities helps to keep the nuclear peace, and so protect Australians from the most serious threat to their national survival-global nuclear war. The joint facilities undoubtedly make nuclear war less likely. Those who argue that the joint facilities should be removed have to show how Australians would be safer if nuclear war were more likely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, only slightly more coherent. I agree with the first part of his motion-that the Government should, as a matter of urgency, address all dimensions of the crises in defence effectiveness, morale and economics. There are real crises in this area. The manpower situation and the morale situation are very worrying. In the five years since the Australian Labor Party Government came to power, of our Defence Force of roughly 70,000, 45,000 have voted out with their feet. The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, pretends that there is no problem. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) even went so far as to say in August this year that the high number of resignations was good for morale. Good for morale! The high resignation rates cause great disruption of the Australian Defence Force. Training costs go up enormously. If there is a constant personnel turnover, training costs increase, which is a great drain on the available defence budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a loss of experience. Untrained or inexperienced people hold critical jobs. There is a loss of available effectives. If too many people are undergoing basic training there will be that many fewer people available for the jobs which require experienced, trained personnel. I will give the Senate a couple of examples of the mess this Government has created. In the last five years we have lost 300 trained pilots. A fair assessment of how much the training of those 300 pilots would have cost would be $800m-that is, $800m of wastage by this Government. To try and overcome the wastage, the Government introduced a bizarre scheme to give pilots $70,000 each if they agreed to stay on for a period. That scheme had problems. One problem was that other defence personnel of at least equal skill and importance could not see why the pilots got $70,000 to stay on and they did not. Worse still, the scheme did not work because the pilots who stayed-the helicopter pilots-were not going anyway, and the fixed wing pilots left to join the commercial airlines as they were always going to do in the first place. That is typical of the way this Government is mishandling defence. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many areas where things are not working out properly. Pay is inadequate. For the first time in history our officers are now being paid less than British officers of equivalent ranks. They receive $10,500 a year less than equivalent British officers. There are problems other than pay, although that is important. There is a general feeling that the Government is not interested in defence, that it does not care about defence, that defence is a nuisance it must put up with-`Let us do as little about it as possible'. The Government does not care about the people who make up the Defence Force. If it has to have something, it wants showy capital projects. Too much of our resources are going into that area and too little are going into keeping contented and efficient the people on whom an effective defence force depends.</PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into all the matters that are causing concern because the debate does not allow sufficient time for that, but I will itemise a couple. People in the Defence Force, pay 5.5 per cent of their salary as a compulsory contribution to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits fund. If they leave before they have completed 20 years of service they get their contributions back with no interest. Defence housing is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> So many other support systems are needed for the very special problems in the Defence Force, and I itemise just one to show the way the Government is making a total mess of it. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has been very vocal about her efforts in the education area. It is good that she recognises there is a problem but the publicity and the reality do not match. She has talked a lot about tuition allowances. Out of 30,000 married personnel in the Services, only 27 children are receiving a tuition allowance-and the Minister makes a big deal of it. If she had said this was just a start we could see that, although very little was being done, the situation might improve; but she thinks this is a wonderful achievement. This is typical of the great problems that effect our Services and the morale of personnel. They are things that this Government seems unable to comprehend and tackle, but they must be tackled in the interests of the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area this Government cannot tackle is defence management. Recently a joint committee reported on the organisation of the Department of Defence. The report was severely critical, and correctly so. The report was unaminous from the members of all parties. It was not a partisan report; Government and Opposition members all agreed that the structure and organisation of the Department of Defence were a disgrace. The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, rejected the report. He talked about having creative tension between the public servants and the defence officers. There is certainly tension, but I think it would be a very peculiar person who thought it was creative. What we have is divided responsibility between public servants and trained defence personnel. Unqualified public servants have responsibilities which they cannot effectively carry out. We have grotesque overmanning in the Department and over-ranking in the Defence Force. As an example, the Army now has 65 officers of the rank of brigadier and above, the Royal Australian Air Force has 48 air commodores and above, and the Royal Australian Navy has 43 commodores and above. There are very few operational appointments for any of those people. For instance, the Navy has only one operational job for its 11 rear admirals, and it has no sea jobs for its 30 commodores. The result is that we have these people manning committees, matching themselves up with public servants, and being involved with all these interminable committees and organisations of the Defence Department-and they are not in current operational training. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole rank structure has gone astray and the reason is that the public servant-defence rank matching has been grotesquely skewed. The public servants are brought in one or probably two ranks too high and that has caused a necessary matching explosion in the number of senior officers in the forces. That is a problem that the Minister just must tackle, but it seems he will not. The organisation is a disgrace. The only way to sum up the situation is by an old Greek saying: `Give mine enemy a golden sword'. I think a modern version might well be, `Give mine enemy an organisation like the Australian Defence Department'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where, up to a point, I agree with what the Australian Democrats' motion says. Let us come to where I start disagreeing. The motion refers to the importance of defence effectiveness and morale, and it then says we must:</PARA>
<PARA>Integrate our defence and other forces into potent dual civil/military roles and structures such as to render them of immediate relevance and visability through such roles as fire fighting, emergency services, rescue, coastal patrol, drug surveillance and others. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume the `others' would include the Boy Scouts. What we cannot do if we have a highly trained professional force and we wish to maintain efficiency and morale is dissipate members of that force around as aids and all sorts of other things. Certainly in moments of extreme crisis that may happen, but we should not expect them to be auxiliary firemen, auxiliary drug surveillants or auxiliary rescue people. If that does happen, we will not have an efficient, professional force. It is a possible role for the half-trained conscripts all over the place, but it is not a role that is compatible with the high morale, professional Defence Force which we have now. So there is a gross internal contradiction in the Democrats' motion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is worse to follow. The Democrats want to bring Australia to a position of armed neutrality, and they want to maintain and demonstrate a strong nuclear free stance. At the same time, they want to cut back the money spent on defence. The first target of this is, without doubt, the ANZUS alliance-the alliance between Australia and the United States. We ought to be quite clear about the value of this alliance to Australia. I am in favour of it. I think it is of great value to Australia. It is also of value to the United States. It does not guarantee American support. The Americans will come to our aid if they think it is in their strategic interest to do so. If we think about it, it would be disgraceful if they operated on any other basis. But the ANZUS alliance ensures that what happened when the Americans came to our assistance in 1942 will not happen again. In 1942 we had no common tactical doctrine, no common ammunition and no common communications. We just could not operate together. It took at least a year to sort that out. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place the ANZUS alliance ensures that, if ever they need to come to our aid again, that aid will be immediately effective. Secondly, the ANZUS alliance allows us to keep operationally effective by exercising with the Americans and with others so that our forces can be brought up to a higher pitch of efficiency than would be possible if they were entirely self-contained. Thirdly, and in some ways most importantly, the ANZUS alliance links us into the American supply network so that we can, with the same rights as American forces, demand stores from their worldwide supply network. That is of great financial advantage to us. It has been estimated, and I think it is an underestimate, that if we did not have the alliance with America the cost of maintaining the present modest capability of our Defence Force would double. So much for the Democrats trying to cut back on defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats also seem to link this in to a desire to opt out of a nuclear war. My attitude is that if a nuclear war occurs it will be devastating for the whole earth. I do not know whether this will cause a nuclear winter or the total elimination of mammalian life on earth, but what I do know is that all the previous estimates by nuclear physicists of the likely effects of their weapons have been underestimates. We must accept that a nuclear war would be a total catastrophe for the whole earth. Once it starts, it will not stop short of an all-out exchange of 40,000 or 50,000 weapons, or whatever the number is. We must as responsible people do what we can, in our own interests as well as the interests of the rest of the world, to prevent such an event taking place. The American facilities in Australia have several functions, some of which are beneficial to us and some of which are beneficial to America, but the dominant reason I like having them in Australia and why they must remain here is that they contribute to lessening the likelihood of a global nuclear exchange. That is in our interests and in the interests of the whole world, and to reject that concept I think is a total abdication of our international responsibility and our responsibility to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, in my view, a very foolish motion. The Australian Democrats have highlighted some of the ways in which this Government has been neglecting our Defence Force. That is accurate, but the way in which it is being handled-suggesting that we can in some way hide our head in the sand, that in some way we should try to opt out of the world and hope that the world will pass us by and not notice us-is totally irresponsible. We are a mature country with considerable potential power. We must make our contribution to making this country, and the world, a safer place. We can do that. We must do it, and we must eschew this sort of pacifist rubbish-which it is-because it does not get to grips with the real nature of the world scene. I sympathise with the motives of the Australian Democrats'. I suppose they are honourable, but they are very foolish indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As other speakers have said, this is a very confused motion that we are debating today and it makes addressing oneself to it within 15 minutes somewhat difficult. I have tried to analyse the origin of the confusion, and I can think only of some two or three explanations. One is that it is based on some sort of political `throwing mud at the wall' theory; that one throws in everything one can possibly think of, throws as much mud at the wall as can be imagined, and hopes that something will stick. The related explanation is what is sometimes called the `bower bird theory'; that is, one picks up a little idea from here and a little idea from there and elsewhere, sticks them all together and hopes that somehow or other they will make a composite whole. Or, as a member of my staff suggested to me, perhaps it was in the best Australian Democrat tradition-the Democrats had a Caucus meeting and every member of the party wrote a clause. They stuck them together and composed a motion, but none of them had spoken to each other. Irrespective of the explanation of their confusion and contradiction, I have to accept that in 15 minutes I am not going to be able to cover all aspects of the motion. So I will attempt to complement the contributions made by my colleague Senators Schacht and Black, and concentrate on the areas of effectiveness, economics and the related question of the dual civil and military roles of the military.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion, as proposed, calls for a restructuring of Australia's Defence Force to address the `crises in defence effectiveness'. I think it has been very unfair and unreasonable and all too easy to attack the effectiveness of Australia's defence forces. It would be unfair and unreasonable to say that now or in any peacetime situation there is no room for improvement in Australia's defence forces and defence facilities. But we do have at the moment, and we are working towards improving, a plan and program that is entirely suited towards Australia's unique geopolitical situation that is based on the concept of self-reliance, as developed in the excellent White Paper of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), and the concept outlined by my colleague Senator Black of layered defence or defence in depth. What is important about this assessment of effectiveness is that it is based on a realistic assessment of the capabilities we may face. It is not based on imagined threats or confident assertions that there will be no problem, nor on a political assessment of who may have the will to use those capabilities, but on a military assessment of what capabilities might exist, and particularly those risks which could arise with little warning. It is conceivable that in five or 10 years time almost any country of substantial size could develop the capabilities to deliver a major attack on some country in its region. But to be able to do so without warning requires it to have already established such an enhanced defence capacity. As Australia's defence is currently constituted, it is designed specifically to meet such capabilities as may reasonably be expected to arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted, in not concentrating too much in this area, to quote both the Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of the Defence Force in their concern about the facile and all too often quoted criticisms of Australia's defence capacity at this moment. The Chief of Naval Staff said:</PARA>
<PARA>I quote a recent public statement with which I totally disagree: `Australia's defence capability is becoming a sick joke to our friends and allies'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that that is a quote from the shadow Minister for defence, Mr Peter White. The Chief of Naval Staff continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If I did not know better I could only assume that the author of that remark had no knowledge of where the truth lay; nor was interested in finding out. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, difficulties such as the shortage in some areas of trained personnel. In other areas we are losing more than we can really afford; and no Chief of Staff will ever claim that his service has enough money for operating expenses; but while we may be relatively small, I have no hesitation in saying that the ADF is as professional as it has ever been. A realistic approach is being taken to the allocation of resources to ensure that the balance between capability, readiness and sustainability is maintained. As I have said before, we are not preparing for World War III. The balance that has been struck is sensible in terms of current strategic outlook and flexible enough that we can react to the uncertainty we could face in the future. So despite the criticism of the ill-informed, Australia does have a Defence Force with a capability to meet credible, I again stress credible, contingencies and the infrastructure to expand in response to higher levels of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very eloquent and effective contribution from the Chief of Naval Staff. I would also like to quote the Chief of the Defence Force. In a recent public statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has a coherent defence policy, an efficient and effective Defence Force and skilled service professionals in whom Australians can feel pride and confidence. Yet it has become almost fashionable in some small but vocal segments of the community to talk about the rundown of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and of our defence in general. Both propositions are demonstrably untrue. Unchecked, they are potentially damaging and run the risk of causing Australians to lose confidence in their Defence Force. Such propositions are also depressing for the ADF itself which knows that reality is otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome those comments by those two very senior and respected defence spokespersons for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the question of defence economics, although that as a concept is a bit hard to understand and it is unexplained. Senator McLean talks about restructuring to address dimensions of the crises in defence economics. I assume by `defence economics' he means determination of the extent of the resources required to carry out necessary tasks when put against the range of possible resources to which the taxpayers' resources could otherwise be applied and, as a subpart of that, the allocation of those resources between various defence-related options. That is only my interpretation because Senator McLean never actually told me what it meant. But I think, as a student of economics, in an attempt to apply it to defence, that must be what he means. So let us talk about the allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988-89 Budget $7,658m was set aside for defence, a real increase of 0.5 per cent on 1987-88, and there was an increase in the emphasis in that expenditure on personnel. There are various ways in which one can look at possible critiques of that allocation of resources. One is that more should be spent, and the responsibility lies with those who advocate that to explain, in the very old parlance of Australian politics, where the money is coming from?. Are they talking about increasing taxation or reducing expenditure elsewhere? Senator McLean did not address this and I think those on the Opposition side tend not to address the question of how they will fund increased defence expenditure while at the same time reducing the deficit and taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As this is Senator McLean's motion, let me refer to his proposal. He is talking about having a reserve force of 150,000 well paid reservists. I do not know what he means by `well paid'. But if 150,000 reservists are paid $1,000 a year each, it costs $150m. If they are put into full time training for a month on average weekly earnings-which is not exactly being well paid, but we will use that as a definition-it will cost $300m. That is without any extra costs incurred in training or feeding them; it is just for wages. If we are at the upper end of Senator McLean's scale, where he talks about perhaps 250,000 reservists, those figures would be either $250m or $500m. As Senator Black said so effectively, the person whom Senator McLean so selectively quoted, David Martin, has said that defence self-reliance would cost an extra $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to argue that perhaps we are spending too much. If we read Senator McLean's motion we see in it a couple of points which might indicate that is what he thinks. I am not quite sure. But the problem in the defence forces is such that I am certain no-one is advocating reduced expenditure on personnel, and his use of `self-reliance' I think means that we cannot realistically spend less on capital equipment. So what we need to address is whether it is sufficient to meet the reasonable capital equipment requirements outlined in the defence White Paper, consistent with self-reliance and with the concept of layered defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to distinguish between that concept of self-reliance and the concept of armed neutrality, which Mr Martin was referring to when he talked about $3 billion and which Senator McLean referred to earlier. At current levels of capital spending as a proportion of defence spending and given the maintenance of the proportion of defence spending as outlined in the last Budget, the defence budget provides nearly $40 billion of capital expenditure over the next 15 years. The capital program outlined in the White Paper requires only a little over half of that sum, which of course allows flexibility to meet further requirements for equipment and facilities and to expand manpower and operating budgets as circumstances demand. Those figures show that we can afford the defence we need provided we focus carefully on our real priorities. We cannot afford a wish list and we cannot afford something that does not refer to priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make is that the economics of defence, as with economics elsewhere, require the addressing of the issue of priorities. This means that we have to look at how much we put in and where we put it. This Government has been exceptionally successful in getting the resources to the right place. For the first time somebody is actually implementing the much discussed issue of a two-ocean Navy. When I was in the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia, every three years we had the same triennial promise from the Liberal Federal Government. Usually Mr Killen would come across and, with Sir Charles Court, promise that the Government would build a naval base at Stirling, and three years later they would come back and make exactly the same promise. Now, at last, a two-ocean Navy is being developed. We are getting the Air Force to the north of Australia for the first time. For many years Australian defence personnel have been first class and in many instances, the defence equipment has been well planned. If only we could have persuaded any potential aggressors to make sure they came via Sydney, we would have been very well protected, because that was where all the defence resources were. At last they are being sent to the north where they properly belong and we are also sending the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other aspects of efficiency to which I would like to refer but time will not allow. I would like to digress for one moment to say that I am very concerned at one implication of Senator McLean's motion. If, as he said, the concept of armed neutrality would not allow us to put our forces in friendly countries overseas, this would mean that the Army engineers who are currently serving in an extremely popular and effective role in the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea could no longer operate there. I think that would be very unfortunate-a setback for Australian relations and a setback for the development of Papua New Guinea which should not be allowed to happen. There are also other aspects of efficiency and allocation of resources concerning the Cooksey Review of Australia's Defence Cooperation Programs, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the last minute or two to talk about the dual civil and military role and, again, the question of priorities. It is true that at present the military has skills and capabilities to contribute to the civil community in necessary roles such as fire fighting, but firstly we have to assess whether in developing and enhancing them any further-that is, developing our military capacity in the most appropriate way to defend Australia, which is the primary purpose-we have found the most cost efficient way of providing those civil resources. There are many examples of Defence Force personnel making themselves available and making significant contributions in firefighting, in search and rescue, in coastal surveillance and in opposition to drug trafficking. The Australian Defence Force can contribute and already contributes significant resources. We have to remember that the very reason for maintaining armed forces must always be borne in mind as a priority and of necessity the limitations must be placed on how far that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought to reject this motion. It is not fair to so many Australian men and women who are involved to treat the defence forces as a shambles or to say that we are defenceless. I think the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the Defence Force have repudiated that and I think that the motion should be rejected on those grounds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposed to this motion because of a fundamental flaw in the structure of paragraph (2). Also, we do not support paragraph (5) of the motion and we think that paragraph (3) is misleading. For the benefit of the Senate, the whole point of the Australian Democrats' argument turns on the case of armed neutrality. Once again it is the old Democrat proposition that there are easy, simple and cheap solutions that the better minds of this Parliament have never been able to find. It does not matter what the problem is-whether it is migration, an economic problem, a social problem or defence-along come the simple-minded Democrats with a simple, easy, cheap solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for the Democrats' armed neutrality case is that they are basically a pacifist party and they have always been that way. They are rabidly anti-American, they are in favour of nuclear disarmament and they are very interested in trying to corner the market for the peace vote at present. They know they face extinction in the next Senate election and, grasping at straws, they are trying to corral the vote of the peace movement and take it away from people such as Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn. It is very interesting to note that they did not offer a voice today to either Senator Dunn or Senator Vallentine, the representatives of the peace party, in what is inherently a pacifist debate. They did that with damn good reason-because they do not want to help those people in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that is behind their approach is that the Australian Democrats are inherently a lazy party. They do not contribute to the running of this chamber and only today we learned that the deputy presidency that they held has gone because it is too much work for them. They do not take any part at all in the Estimates committees-the hardest working committees in this place. There is not one Democrat on any of the six Estimates committees. They get involved only in issues in which they think there is a benefit for them in terms of the vote. The great difficulty in life for the Democrats is working out whether they do something to help the Labor Government or to help themselves with their vote. So we have the Democrats' simplistic solutions for what are inherently very difficult, very complex and very expensive programs. The defence of Australia falls into all those categories. But unfortunately for the Democrats it is something that the Parliament cannot run away from. The Democrats can run away from it because they know they will never be in a position of having to take a decision about the government of this country because they will never be the government of Australia. I suppose that is the one good point about the whole of the existence of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition of having armed neutrality is not open for Australia. It is not open on political, economic and, least of all, military grounds. What are the Democrats saying when they talk about armed neutrality? Do they want Australia to become like India, to get up and sanctimoniously mouth the cause of peace at every international forum, but at the same time stoking billions of dollars into a nuclear armaments industry? Do they want to arm Australia with nuclear weapons in the way the Indians have armed themselves behind the guise of being a non-aligned nation? Do they want us to be like Cuba and have tens or hundreds of thousands of Australian servicemen in Africa doing the bidding of the Soviets? Tragically for the Cubans, the last public health estimates show that well over 50 per cent of the troops they have committed in Africa are infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome so Cuba has paid a very high price for being a lackey for the Soviets in their African adventures. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot about Sweden, not only from the Democrats but also from the Australian Labor Party, because it is one of those cherished Valhallas for the socialists of this world. But as Senator Schacht said, in a rare moment of historical accuracy, they were the people who were selling iron ore non-stop to the Germans through the Second World War. We do not want to be like Sweden or Switzerland anyway because their armed forces have not fought for about 200 years and the one certainty in life is that if they were ever called upon to defend their countries they would be a total and abject failure. The only reason they have not been called on to fight is that Sweden and Switzerland are irrelevancies in world power politics. It has always suited the giants of Europe to keep Sweden and Switzerland as independent countries for their own good purposes. It is quite a different proposition for Australia. As a regional power in the south Pacific region we have responsibilities, and those responsibilities have impacted on this Government, which used to talk like the Democrats before it came into office. While the Government's educational program is quite incomplete at the moment, it has changed dramatically from the stance it took some years ago when it followed the same line of nonsense that the Democrats are putting out today. So politically it is not an option for us to go down that path. It is not an option for us to go down that path from an economic point of view. There would be an absolutely huge cost that the Australian public could not bear of maintaining the size of the Services. We would have to run well over 200,000 to 300,000 men and women in uniform at any one time if we got rid of all our alliances and stood completely on our own feet to defend this country. We just could not afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in this debate Senator Schacht talked about the fact that, inevitably, we would have to go down the path of conscription. I do not agree with that. I differ very much from Senator Schacht's proposition that conscription would lead us onto a path of embarking on wartime adventures. That is a complete and total non sequitur. I have no objection to conscription. I do not believe that conscription is a political issue in Australia today, provided three conditions are met: firstly, that everyone goes in; secondly, that service is for a short period, three or six months, followed by training in the Reserves afterwards; and, thirdly, that everyone serves on the Australian mainland and not overseas. We should go back to the situation where Australian servicemen abroad have always been volunteers. If those three conditions are met I see no problem with introducing conscription. But I do not see the possibility of any government, whether it is Liberal or Labor, introducing conscription in the next decade or two simply on economic grounds. It would cost us a great deal of money-money that should be spent on repairing the great ravages to the defence forces that have taken place under the economic neglect of the Labor Party. So conscription just is not an issue at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we come to the simple military side of it. Apart from the number of people we would need in the defence forces, we simply could not develop the military techniques with the small force structure that we have without a reliance on alliances. There we get to the very heart of the matter. Australia, with its population, has to have alliances. If Senator McLean reads the White Paper he will find in chapter one the central statement that alliances are critical to Australia's military posture. Well they might be. Of course, the most important of those alliances is the ANZUS alliance which is anathema to the Democrats and the nuclear disarmers because it is an American alliance and anything that is American has to be very bad and cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point we do not agree with is the proposition that we have to maintain and demonstrate a strong nuclear-free stance. That is, typically, a misleading statement by the Democrats trying to imply that Australia, under a Labor government, has nuclear forces. If they knew anything about the subject matter they would know that, under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which was signed by the Liberal Government, we cannot have nuclear arms in Australia and the nuclear arming of Australian forces is not an option that is considered at all by any of the major parties at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point on which we and the Democrats differ is item five which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Support trends away from vast expenditures on armaments which reflect assumption of global conflict . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry. Australia, with its small population, with very big geographical responsibilities in defending our land mass, which is as large as continental United States of America, simply has to use high technology as a force multiplier to make up for the small numbers we have. Regrettably, that is very expensive; there is no simple way out of it. To go down the path that Senator Coulter wandered down in his misguided way, railing about the armaments industry and all the rest of it, completely overlooks the fact that the countries that put money into developing arms-maybe they put in too much-derive a great benefit in terms of employment and the spin-off that comes from the scientific and technological advances made through military research. They are of very real benefit to the civilian population. So the Opposition is delighted that the Government is supporting it in opposing this urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the Labor Party spokesman. It is rather sad that, in the Senate today, we do not have one person, either in the ministerial ranks of the Labor Party or on the back bench, who can get up and take part in any defence debate. Not one member of the Labor Party in the Senate today has any knowledge at all, let alone any specialised knowledge, in the field of defence. I think that reflects the importance of defence in the Labor Party style of things. Senator Schacht, who spoke today, is just a great tourist. He wanders around the world and thinks he knows a bit about foreign affairs. Senator Black then read a speech that came out of the Department of Defence-the same sort of speech that Mr Beazley normally reads when he is trying to convince us that all is well. We then had a similar thing with Senator McMullan who drew heavily on the writings of the Department of Defence. Not one of the three speakers we had today had any ability to tackle the subject in any depth at all. In that circumstance it is not surprising that some mistakes were made. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sick and tired of hearing in this chamber that the Labor Party bought the F18s. Let me put on the record once and for all that the Liberal-National Party Government undertook the work. I see that Senator Tate is smiling but he knows damned well, because in the old Parliament House he sat through many a speech that I made on the virtues of the F18 before the contract was signed, that the contract for that was signed in 1981-two years before the Labor Party came into power. It is quite mischievous for and highly ignorant of people on the other side of the chamber to claim now that this was a Labor Party initiative. The other thing that disturbed me was that Senator Black, when reading his Mr Beazley-type speech, told us that the Australian defence forces will maintain a qualitative jump ahead of all other regional forces. Mr Acting Deputy President, that is not true. If you knew anything about the activities of the Association of South East Asian Nations and other countries in the region you would know that Australia has a very tenuous hold on its technological advantage. In fact, in some fields in some services we are quite behind what is going on in the countries of some of our close neighbours and that is a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I take exception to the very singular view of history that Senator Schacht had. Senator Schacht had a view that the Services have always done well under Labor. Nothing could be further from the truth. The tragic loss of 45,000 out of the 70,000-odd personnel that has taken place under the Hawke Administration has been paralelled completely by the great disabilities the defence forces suffered under the Scullin Government. In the late 1920s, under Mr Scullin, the same tired thesis of no threat for 10 years was wheeled out and postulated to the Australian people as an excuse for not putting enough into the defence forces-precisely the same argument as Mr Beazley and Mrs Kelly are running today. It is not true, but it is an old cliche of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragic things that the Labor Party has done has been to destroy totally the capability of the Australian defence forces. Through its neglect, which stems from a lack of leadership and a lack of adequate funds, many people have resigned from the defence forces. I regret very much that defence, which should be a bipartisan issue, and which has the support of the major parties in this place, should be turned into a political football by a bunch of political opportunists such as the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

I want to place on record that I am very keen to enter into this debate which is not in line with what some honourable senators said-that I am not interested in the defence of this country. I certainly am. I was relegated to the last position on the speakers' list because of the need for the major parties to have three speakers each and, therefore, as an Independent it was not possible for me to get to a higher spot on the list although I was one of the first people to put my name forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to spell out alternatives to Australia's current defence strategy of self-reliance within the alliance which, to me, is a contradiction in terms. This debate is already well under way in Europe and, more recently, in New Zealand; so it is about time that we got such a debate under way in the community in Australia. I start by making my own position clear. As a member of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, and War Resistance International, I am a pacifist. I do, however, realise that Australia is highly unlikely to be converted to pacifism overnight. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to canvass the issue of parliamentarians' salaries at the moment-undoubtedly there will be further debate with regard to that-but I refer particularly to an item which I think is of interest to the Senate; that is, remuneration for judges. Some time ago this chamber passed unanimously an amendment to the motion for the second reading of a Bill dealing with the salary level of Family Court judges. The Senate expressed the unanimous view that the salary of Family Court judges ought to be the same as the salary for Federal Court judges. The report of the Remuneration Tribunal again indicates a disparity between the two groups. It is most unfortunate that the Tribunal should put forward this proposition, which is detrimental to achieving within the community parity of recognition for the service of Family Court judges and Federal Court judges. Indeed, I believe that over time we ought to have a Family Court division of the Federal Court of Australia. The cross-vesting which this chamber debated and passed some time ago has significantly improved the attractiveness of the position of a Family Court judge. That area and the area of senior public service-not in the sense of a capital `p' and a capital `s' but in public service across the board; that is, in positions which are required for the administration of government, justice and our major instrumentalities-are bleeding. They do not have the salaries to attract and to retain the top people. In determining a salary level one has to look at the level of remuneration that is available to people outside. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this chamber might remember that on another occasion we voted down a provision within a Bill brought forward by the Government to peg all salaries within higher education institutions so that there would be parity across the board. I moved that that provision be deleted on the grounds that where a university has to attract, for example, people in computer science, biotechnology or other areas, it is not competing against just other tertiary institutions; it is competing against a market. If we want such people to be in our tertiary institutions to train the next generation we have to be able to pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation is occurring with accountants. I have had discussions on this matter; other senators may have also. There is a problem in that within three or four years an accountant can reach the salary level of a professor of accountancy in a tertiary institution. The community might wish to turn a blind eye to these facts, to talk about fat cats and all the rest of it. The fat cats in the media who write the editorials might like to do the same. Of course, they never bother declaring what large salaries they get. But people who engage in such exercises have to bear in mind that those professions are bleeding. They are not able to attract the top quality people. Because of the market outside-whether in the judiciary, the administration of the major positions in the country or the tertiary institutions-they are not able to attract or to retain the people we need to teach the next generation or, in terms of the judges, to administer justice in this country. Unless the media are willing to debate that matter in a fair and reasonable way, unless people in the community are willing to recognise that that problem exists whether they like it or not, I fear that we will lose our best people in the area of public service. If public service is not supported I think we will find over time enormous detriment to the community because of the lack of these best people willing to give of their time and service to the public. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak with great pleasure on the report for 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1988 of the political exchange program. The aims of this program, as pointed out in the report by Sir Robert Cotton, the Chairman of the Australian Political Exchange Committee, are to provide development opportunities for the rising generation of national leaders and, as more formally stated in the report itself, to foster international understanding and goodwill through the exchange of young political leaders, and to provide opportunities for young people involved in politics to study the political systems of other countries. It is a particular pleasure for me to speak to this report since I am a former participant in the program. It was a pleasure to be involved in the program, not least because for two weeks of my life only three or four years ago I was, in fact, officially young; and that was quite nice. Those aims which I have just read out are very well met, I believe, by this program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from page 9 of the report that some of the benefits are easily quantifiable. On page 9 there is a list of participants `who have achieved greater prominence in political life since their participation'. That list includes me since, when I was a participant, I was not a member of parliament; I was President of the Australian Democrats in Victoria and Deputy National President, typical of positions from the various political parties which have been represented in this program. Since then I have become a senator, and several other members of various parliaments have either entered parliaments since they were participants or have achieved ministerial rank. Among them are Peter Staples, now the Minister for Housing and Aged Care; Mark Birrell in Victoria, who is now a shadow Minister; and a number of others, including James Porter, a Federal Opposition member. That list represents over 10 per cent of the 97 participants who have travelled overseas on this program, but I suggest it is really only the tip of the iceberg: there are other participants who have gone overseas and who have neither come into the Parliament subsequently nor achieved ministerial or shadow ministerial rank but who are out there working in the political system of this country to greater effect because of their participation in the program. I know that to be the case for delegates who have represented the Australian Democrats, not least because two of them are actually working in my office and are much more effective, I am sure, for their participation. Others are in executive positions in our Party and have been candidates and so on, as is the case with other parties. I would not want honourable senators to look at that list and think that was the only list of achievements; there is a lot of extra work going on in all parties because of this program. </PARA>
<PARA> There is on page 3 a note which states that, because the delegates have been carefully chosen, they have worked well together. That is true in the main. It is not one of the formal aims of this program that groups of various political parties be brought together in order to learn to work together and to learn more about each other as well as about the overseas countries and political systems that they experience, but it is certainly one of the results of this program. It is a sort of hot-house atmosphere when six to nine participants go overseas in a small group and are together all of the time, especially, I imagine, in those exchanges with China where there is a language barrier. It has been particularly useful for the Australian Democrats. One would have to admit that when several representatives from other parties and one sole Democrat are together on such an exchange, relations can become less than cordial. I must say that it is good training for working in this place. It is an effective program. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I express the hope that discussions which were held between the Democrats representative on the Committee, Mr Sid Spindler, and the Committee of Youth Organisations of the Soviet Union result in an extension of the program to exchanges with that important nation as well as the United States, Canada and China, where the delegations are currently operating. I commend the report and the program to the Senate, the community and the corporate sector, whose help is very much needed to fund this program. I urge other former participants to maintain their contacts, to help build networks of support within the Parliament, within politics, and out in the community-particularly in the corporate sector, which has been very good in supporting it and the help of which is still needed. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate should also take note that there are more Australian Democrats in the chamber at the moment than members of any other political party. (Quorum formed) In referring to the report Girls in Schools, and now having a truncated period in which to put the Australian Democrats' point of view, I refer to a couple of phrases in the report. A great many awareness raising activities have been undertaken and non-sexist and counter-sexist resource allocations have been established in our school systems. The question of sexual harassment is raised and there is concern about that. It is clear that what is important is the environment for girls in schools. That environment necessarily, and disappointingly, reflects the environment in the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the good work that is going on in schools in systems throughout Australia and for all the good intentions, the environment in the community gets no better. I have three examples from very recent press reports. Last week, on 25 November, there was an article headed `Police rape comments upset women'. Two senior Victorian policemen said that some women had been raped because they had put themselves in vulnerable situations. Today's Australian has a bit of a romp by Bryce Courtenay in the marketing pitch in the business section. He expects to get some flak and certainly he should. I do not object to his suggesting that women were invented to be pretty like birds and flowers. I do not object to that too much. What I do object to is his statement that a non-pretty woman producing work for him which, as he says, is the same sort of dull stuff that he has seen before. He then says that since prettiness, which was possible, he thought, when he looked behind all her ugliness, was the only talent she had, she should exploit it. I am sure that he does not suggest that to all the males who give him dull work. </PARA>
<PARA> The article which is perhaps the most insulting to a number of people in this chamber is Alan Ramsey's contribution to an article in the Good Weekend supplement on women in Parliament, in which he states that tokenism is alive and well in the Federal Parliament. He argues that there are only three or four women in Parliament who are here for anything more than cosmetic purposes. I would say that there are a heck of a lot of men in this Parliament who do a lot less work than the women do, and who cannot claim to have any cosmetic purpose whatsoever. I add also that if my division had wanted to elect a Democrat for cosmetic purposes, it could have done a damn sight better, if that was the only purpose for which it wanted to elect a Democrat to this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak to the Report on the National Policy for the Education of Girls in Australian Schools entitled Girls in Schools. I am probably minded to thank Senator Puplick for calling a quorum because I had not been able to stay in the chamber and I had in mind to speak on this report. I welcome this report. Any of us who have followed the history and the struggle of girls and women to get an education over the last 100 or 150 years know just how important it is that we now have a national policy addressing the needs of education for girls in this country. I think it is important to note, in the introduction to this report, the comment that the development of the policy for girls was a landmark event, as it is the first national policy on any aspect of schooling. It is to be remarked that it is the first national policy and that it addresses the difficulties confronting girls in getting an adequate and comprehensive education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is very useful not only because it covers State by State the ways in which education systems are tackling the issue of adequate and comprehensive education for girls, but also because it outlines the way in which what has been done to this point leads into the need for and the development of further areas of policy, implementation of programs, and so on. It also spells out the way in which the responsibility for an adequate education for girls policy must take into account not only the requirements for different curricula but also the involvement of schools, teachers and education system administrators. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very useful as a model for other areas of national consideration of education. I know that this is not the only policy area in which the Commonwealth Government is looking at national policies in education that may be of benefit for other areas in the community. In particular, I am pleased to note that, as well as this national policy, there is reference to specific developments for the education of girls. The program for girls in science and mathematics has been designed and is under way. I also draw attention to another report entitled Girls' Achievement and Self-Esteem: the Contribution of Physical Education and Sport, a project that enjoyed $550,000 of support from 1984 to 1987. It was undertaken in cooperation with the Education Department of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at education for girls, the Government has realised the importance not only of their intellectual development but also of their physical development. The report entitled, Girls' Achievement and Self-Esteem: the Contribution of Physical Education and Sport-a review of research, resources and strategies by Dr Dwyer, based on initial research by Ms H. Daniels also covers a very important area. It is of interest to me because I am particularly interested in women's sport and the importance of an adequate women in sport program, depending of course on the involvement of girls in sport and the importance of maintaining that interest in sport by girls, not only through primary school but also in secondary school. The achievement of girls in education cannot be left to the deliberation of what might be done within the classroom. There needs to be a comprehensive analysis of all the needs of girls-both their physical and intellectual development. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see in this report an examination and a comprehensive review of all those things that are in place to try to ensure that girls in Australia obtain benefit from education. Girls have also been disadvantaged because of the sex stereotyping of education to this point and also the sex stereotyping of the physical education they have been able to participate in. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a very useful report. I think it is well worth the deliberation of people in this place and, certainly, of people in the community. If we are to have comprehensive education for girls in this country, we must ensure that the information contained in this document is widely available to parents of girls. I am certainly not advocating education for girls at the expense of boys. But the emphasis has been disadvantaging of girls in large part because of community attitudes, parental concern and insufficient information and support for them in the decisions which they might want to help their girls achieve. I think this document is a most useful one. I am delighted that we have it and can use it for further reference to see advantages for our girls. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the fact that this report quotes a number of standards which have been adopted by the Australian Capital Territory Radiation Council with respect to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I note that all of those standards which have been adopted are old standards. The situation with respect to setting standards in radiation is rather different from setting standards for many other chemical substances because it is generally accepted that there is no safe level of radiation. When one sets a standard of radiation exposure, one is accepting that there is some risk associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards which this body is applying are old standards, based very much on the older assessment of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and of those patients who were heavily exposed to radiation in the 1940s for the treatment of diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis. Recent recalculation of the risks associated with the radiation exposure of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors has indicated a very considerable underestimate of the risks associated with that radiation. Generally speaking, expert opinion around the world is of the view that the standard should be decreased by a factor of about three. I understand that that has actually been done in the United Kingdom by the National Radiological Protection Board. It is also in the process of being adopted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Therefore, it is of concern to note that in the ACT we are still complying with the old standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Several years ago I gave evidence to the Industrial Court in South Australia in an award case for radiologists. The officer in the South Australian Health Commission responsible for radiological protection, Jill Fitch, gave evidence that she would mount an inquiry into exposure of radiologists only if the radiation exposure proved to be more than one-quarter of the then allowable limit. Using the figures which were published by the Biological Effects of Ionising Radiation Committee-known as the BEIR Committee-which is a subcommittee of the National Academy of Sciences, it was possible to calculate that the level of extra cancer risk to which the South Australian Health Commission considered that workers may be exposed involved an increased risk, if I remember the figures correctly, of between 3 and 16 per cent. If one accepts that the present acceptable levels should be reduced by a factor of three, one sees that one quarter of the old level is remarkably close to the maximum level of radiation to which people can be exposed. It also represents a very significant increase in the cancer risk of people working with radiation, such as radiographers, radiologists, dentists and the like. For these reasons, it is of great concern to me that the allowable levels of radiation in the ACT are based entirely on the old standards, which are currently under review and which, I believe, have been discarded by the National Radiological Protection Board in Great Britain. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1987-88 annual report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) is an even more important report than usual because it covers the period including the stock market crash of October 1987 and its aftermath. The NCSC, of course, is Australia's corporate watchdog. It is the linchpin of the cooperative arrangements negotiated between the Commonwealth and the States in 1978 to promote commercial certainty, reduce business costs, improve efficiency and maintain investors' confidence in our securities markets. </PARA>
<PARA> This cooperative scheme was a major initiative of the Fraser Government. It is perhaps the classic example of the Fraser Government's concept of cooperative federalism in practice. The cooperative scheme has been a notable success. The NCSC has had its critics-that is for sure. It would be amazing if it had not, given the maze of conflicting interests with which it has to work and through which it has to steer a course of reasonableness, propriety, encouragement and regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, is now attempting to tear down the cooperative scheme and replace it with the time-honoured resort of socialists, namely, centralisation of political and bureaucratic power in Canberra. The Government has introduced a huge new package of corporate law-the biggest legislative package ever introduced into the Federal Parliament. It has done that with unseemly haste and with totally inadequate consultation with Australia's finance industries, which are the lifeblood of our commercial activity and the subject of the Government's legislative proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The package, which would abolish the NCSC and replace it with the Australian Securities Commission plus a panoply of supporting bureaucracy, proposes quite fundamental changes in Australia's securities legislation, spanning such critically important areas as the Takeovers Code, the issuing and vetting of prospectuses, insider trading and the futures markets. It is disgraceful that these changes are being proposed with virtually no consultation with the markets involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Senate has had the good sense to refer the Government's proposals to a parliamentary joint select committee for examination. The committee's terms of reference are not as wide as the Liberal and National parties believe are necessary. This is because the Labor Government, with the connivance of the Australian Democrats, refused to give the select committee the powers necessary to examine in depth the whole philosophical underpinning of the Government's centralist proposals. Nevertheless, the committee will provide a very important forum for consideration and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The NCSC in its report has drawn particular attention to the Government's delay in taking action in many areas. For example, on page 8 of the annual report the Commission says that because of the huge legislative package the Government has introduced:</PARA>
<PARA>the process of modernising and reforming policy in specific areas has been substantially slowed. </PARA>
<PARA>One major example has been the Government's failure, as yet, to introduce measures to allow appropriate company share buy-backs. To the extent that the NCSC has been subject to valid criticism, much of this is due to the deliberate policy of this Government of starving the Commission of the necessary funds to carry out its essential tasks. The Government has prevented the NCSC from properly fulfilling its statutory responsibilities as Australia's corporate watchdog by deliberately starving it of necessary funds. This was obvious in the recent evidence to Senate Estimates Committee E. </PARA>

As a companion measure, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) is also introducing the Circuit Layouts Bill 1988 to provide sui generis copyright-style protection for plans for computer chips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These major amendments are the third stage of this Government's reform of the copyright law. In 1984, we introduced amendments to make it clear that computer programs, and other works in invisible computer memory, were protected against unauthorised copying. In 1986 we introduced amendments to substantially strengthen the anti-piracy provisions and to give the handicapped greater access to copyright materials. The amendments that are being introduced today are the result of extensive consultations by the Government with consumers, educators and industry participants, particularly in the last two years. The Government's aim is to provide a fair, certain and effective copyright law which will properly reward innovators and reflect modern consumer practice, while taking into account the legitimate practical considerations that affect particular groups such as educational institutions and institutions working for the handicapped. The need to amend the law so frequently is the direct result of advances in technology. Copyright, as much as-or even more than-any other area of the law, is vitally affected by technological developments which allow copyright material to be used in new ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I think I have covered a number of the more significant features of the second reading speech. I might conclude by detailing the financial impact of the Bill, which I think--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose one could say either. In that case, I might just continue with an issue of which I have some knowledge that I think would be of interest to the Senate, which comes under the heading of `Statutory Licence: Photocopying by Educational Institutions'. I think Senator Puplick would be concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Statutory Licence: Photocopying by Educational Institutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this Bill will also revise the existing educational photocopying scheme. The present scheme has proved to be extremely cumbersome to operate and costly to administer because of its complex record keeping requirements. Following expressions of dissatisfaction from both educational institutions and copyright owners, the Government examined the feasibility of a revised scheme which could operate along the same lines as the scheme for copying of television programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst substantially preserving the range and extent of materials that may be copied, the revised scheme is based largely on voluntary agreements already entered into between Copyright Agency Ltd-the authors' and publishers' collecting society-and a substantial number of educational institutions throughout Australia. Co-operation in this regard has largely been achieved by abandoning the record keeping requirements of the present scheme under which payments are required for actual copying. Instead, payment is being made on the basis of agreed sampling schemes whereby estimates can be made of the amount of copying and payment made on a per student basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Government facilitate these voluntary arrangements and ensure that they can operate effectively under the legislation. The revised photocopying scheme will adopt the flexibility of the television copying scheme. It will provide for the establishment of a collecting society representative of copyright owners-or a defined class of copyright owners-and will enable schools to elect to pay for copying on a per student basis or, as at present, by full record keeping. However, if full record keeping is opted for, records will now be required to be sent to the relevant collecting society for assessment. This will avoid copyright owners having to carry out time consuming and costly record inspections at the thousands of schools spread around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The criminal penalties in the Act for offences relating to record keeping have understandably been the subject of concern on the part of teachers. These have been substantially omitted from the revised scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> For the teachers who will have recourse to it on a daily basis, the revised scheme will in practice be much simpler to comply with. It will also substantially improve the means of remunerating copyright owners for the user of their copyright materials. In keeping with the proposed changes to the educational photocopying scheme and the new provisions dealing with copying of television programs by educational institutions, the Bill also includes new provisions which will streamline copying by institutions assisting handicapped readers and intellectually handicapped people. </PARA>
<PARA>Copyright-Designs Interaction</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will update the protection given to artistic works that are either registered as designs under the Designs Act 1906 or are industrially applied without registration. Manufacturers, artists and designers of a diverse range of articles experience problems with the excessive copyright protection of `industrial' products by the Copyright Act, the uncertain operation of the legislation and its often inequitable effects. The legislation has also attracted criticism from both legal commentators and the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government published a discussion paper that canvassed various options for reform, and received submissions from copyright owners and industry. The preferred solution was to remove the possibility of copyright protection for three-dimensional industrial products. It is considered that these products should be protected only under the designs legislation or other appropriate law. The Designs Law Review Committee report of 1973 on the law relating to designs also reached this conclusion. The amendments introduced by the Bill will amend the Copyright Act accordingly. In addition, the so-called `non-expert defence' in the Copyright Act is to be repealed. It provides a qualified defence to infringement of the copyright owner's right to reproduce an artistic work in a different dimension. It has not operated as intended and has been the subject of much adverse judicial comment. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will not affect copyright protection for artistic works reproduced on the surface of an article, such as a T-shirt, or for buildings or works of artistic craftspersonship for which a design has not been registered. Thus, protection by copyright will continue for these essentially artistic creations; for example, tapestry or certain craftwork. As well, the changes will not affect designs for articles excluded by regulation from registration under the Designs Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Computer Chips</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill 1988, which protects computer chip layouts from unfair copying, is the second part of the Government's copyright reform package. The Australian computer chip industry is small but important and growing. Australian chips, for example, make bionic ears and heart pacemakers work, detect messages from space and from the ocean, and convert sunlight to power. Importantly, our specialised products have found valuable markets overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequence of the copyright-design reforms already mentioned is that copyright will be of very limited use to chip designers to protect their products against piracy. The Designs Act may apply to some parts of chip layouts but, like copyright, designs monopoly protection is not suitable for chip layouts because it is excessive. Chips are essential products in modern society. Innovators need to be able to stop unauthorised copying in order to protect their investment. However, that protection should not be at the expense of proper availability of the product for use in machinery and consumer appliances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill will repeal inappropriate and uncertain Copyright Act and Designs Act protection, and provide protection for original chip layouts along the lines of the laws passed recently in the United States, Japan, Scandinavia and European Community countries. The Bill is also consistent with the major elements of the World Intellectual Property Organisation's draft `Treaty on the Protection of Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits'. I expect this draft Treaty to be finalised at a diplomatic conference in Washington in May 1989. It is highly desirable that this Bill be law before that conference to ensure that Australia's negotiating position is equal to that of the other countries which already have chip protection laws. In the unfortunate event that the conference does not agree on a treaty, Australia will need to enter into bilateral arrangements. As a result of this Government's representations, Australian chips have been protected in the US since mid-1985. However, that protection is only interim, and ends in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill provides modified copyright protection. It grants to the creator of an original chip layout the exclusive rights-to copy the layout; to make a chip in accordance with the layout; and to first commercially exploit the layout or a chip made in accordance with such a layout. The rights will, like copyright, arise `automatically'. This is a simple, low cost form of protection involving no red tape, which is welcomed by industry and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as a short term of protection-minimum 10 years, maximum 20 years, from making-the Circuit Layouts Bill includes several significant departures from traditional copyright because of: the short market life of chips; the need to preserve fair competition between innovators; and the fact that Australia imports most of its chips, either inside consumer products or for installation in products made here. Accordingly, importation of legitimate chips may not be prevented by the rights owner; a pirate layout or chip innocently acquired may be `on-sold' by the purchaser even after he or she knows of its infringing status, provided the purchaser pays a fair fee to the rights owner; and copying for `reverse engineering' is permitted, and a layout or chip made on the basis of this reverse engineering will not infringe rights in the first layout, provided it is also `original'. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Licence for Record Manufacture</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Act presently contains a statutory licence for the manufacture of recordings of musical work. The relevant provisions specify conditions upon which the licence operates and a mechanism for changing the rate of royalty payable to music copyright owners. This mechanism requires the Attorney-General to determine that the current rate is `inequitable'. Then there is an inquiry and report by the Copyright Tribunal. Any variation of the rate is by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the preliminary requirement for the Attorney-General to determine the current royalty rate to be `inequitable' is an undesirable and inappropriate role for Government. It is also an inappropriate role for the Governor-General to have to consider a Tribunal report and make regulations, where appropriate, to vary the rate. In 1979-80 this matter proved a very controversial one for the Attorney-General of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Copyright Amendment Bill will introduce a simplified scheme, based solely on a Copyright Tribunal determination of the rate in the absence of agreement, which will be consistent with other schemes in the Act, for example, the compulsory licence for broadcasting music. Such a scheme will have industry support and will remove unnecessary government involvement in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Miscellaneous</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Bill will also introduce a number of other reforms which will extend the right of the Australian Archives to copy works in its archival collection, standardise rights of review under the Act and facilitate copyright protection for choreographic works made in the form of film or video. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 will have a minimal impact on Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. There may be some increase in revenue due to a slight expansion of the sales tax base resulting from introduction of the blank tape royalty. The statutory educational copying and blank tape royalty schemes are largely self-administering. The Bill will therefore not directly lead to any increased cost to the Commonwealth. However, there is a possibility of some increased costs to the Commonwealth in relation to funding of the Copyright Tribunal, in that greater demands may be placed on the Tribunal to hear applications under those new statutory licence schemes. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The need to amend the law so frequently is the direct result of advances in technology.

Within the last century, the introduction of the record-player, films, broadcasting, photocopying and cassette and video recorders and, more recently, computer programs has transformed the manner of use of copyright material. The amendments introduced by this Bill will update the law to reflect technological advances and ensure continuing protection for copyright owners. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the more significant of the measures in this Bill in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA>Blank Tape Royalty Scheme for Home Taping</PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Government has been discussing with relevant industry participants a possible legislative scheme for the home-taping of audio materials. Home-taping is widespread in the community. Under the present law this practice is in breach of copyright yet, clearly, it cannot be controlled by copyright owners either by technical means or by legal action. The Government has been anxious to find a solution which would acknowledge the current practice yet also ensure that copyright owners are compensated for the use of their material. In the process, the Government consulted not only with copyright owners and consumer groups, but also with blank tape manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers. The scheme contained in the Bill accommodates the concerns of both consumers and copyright owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Important features of the scheme are:</PARA>
<PARA> Consumers will be able to home-tape published recordings, directly or off-air, for their private and domestic use without infringement of copyright.</PARA>
<PARA> In return, owners of copyright in the recordings will receive remuneration through a royalty to be levied on blank recording tape. </PARA>
<PARA> The royalty will apply to audio tapes with playing times in excess of 30 minutes and will be calculated by reference to the length of the playing time. The actual amount of the royalty will be determined by the Copyright Tribunal having regard to relevant matters such as, for example, the extent of home-taping of eligible copyright material and the value to copyright owners of the material so taped. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of minimising the administrative costs of royalty collection, the duty to pay the royalty will be imposed on the first sellers, i.e., importers and manufacturers, of blank tapes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright owners will only be able to receive royalties where they are members of a single, authorised collecting society, the rules of which have been approved by the Attorney-General. The collecting society will operate along similar lines to existing copyright collecting societies and will be responsible for the collection and distribution of the royalties. The Government will therefore not be involved in the running of the scheme and will not receive any part of the royalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright owners who will benefit from the scheme will include composers, lyricists, authors, music publishing companies and record producers. Very importantly, the recording companies have agreed that a substantial share of the royalty will be passed on to performers under their contracts. This would ordinarily amount to 1/3 of the royalties collected by the society. The Government would be concerned if this share were eroded and will be monitoring this aspect closely. </PARA>
<PARA> These features are consistent with recommendations in the McLeay Report on Commonwealth Assistance to the Arts released in September 1986. That report recommended a levy on blank tapes. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing the impact of home-taping on copyright, Australia is ahead of many comparable countries. However, a number of European countries have already introduced or are proposing to introduce a blank tape royalty scheme in one form or other. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed royalty will be payable on all blank tapes ordinarily used for recording audio materials, including digital audio tapes (DAT). The superior quality of DAT, equivalent at least to that of compact discs, has led to calls here and overseas for bans on equipment not incorporating and `anti-copy' or spoiler device. However, the Government does not favour controlling home-taping by such means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges that not all blank tapes are used for recording material in which the copyright belongs to others. The Bill therefore includes specific provisions to enable institutional users (e.g., schools and institutions for the blind) to purchase tapes free from the royalty. Individuals or organisations who buy tapes on which the royalty has been paid, and who do not copy others' copyright material, will be able to obtain a refund of the royalty. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the scheme the Government has examined very closely is how to treat foreign-owned copyright material. The Government has been concerned to prevent outflow of funds from Australia to foreign countries which do not reciprocate with similar benefits to Australian copyright owners. For this reason, the royalty will be collected for the benefit of only `relevant' copyright owners, that is, owners of Australian audio copyright materials and owners of audio copyright materials in countries which have similar schemes which provide comparable benefits to Australian owners. This will ensure that Australia adheres to the spirit of the relevant international copyright conventions without providing a windfall to foreign owners in countries which have not addressed the problem of home-taping. </PARA>
<PARA> One very important feature of the scheme is that 15% of the royalty raised will be set aside by copyright owners for the benefit of those people in the Australian music industry most in need of assistance. The Government is gratified that the music industry has agreed to provide part of the royalty to the Australian Contemporary Music Development Company, recently established by the Government, to foster Australian contemporary music and, most importantly, young, up-and-coming Australian musicians. Moreover, the 15% will be increased in the event that other substantial music exporting countries introduce similar reciprocal blank tape royalty schemes under which Australian copyright owners could benefit, thereby offsetting some of the potential outflow of funds from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The blank tape royalty will free home-taping from the unsatisfactory status of an infringing activity on terms that meet the convenience of the public and are acceptable to copyright owners. It will also indirectly secure fair recompense to copyright owners for lost sales resulting from the ever increasing spread of home-taping. </PARA>
<PARA>Performers' protection</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will create new civil remedies and criminal offences for the unauthorised use of performers' performances. Performers, including actors, singers, musicians, puppeteers, dancers and variety artists have long advocated the need to have greater legal control over uses of their performances. This Government referred their claims to the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The CLRC's report to the Government on performers' protection clearly expressed the need to provide performers with protection from commercial exploitation of their `unfixed' performances, that is, their live performances (as opposed to recordings of performances). This need has arisen because technological developments have created very effective means of commercial use of performances, namely recording, broadcasting and diffusion by cable. These developments make it increasingly difficult for performers to effectively control the dissemination of their performances. </PARA>
<PARA> As recommended by the majority of the CLRC, the amendments will not confer copyright protection (i.e., property rights) on performers. Instead, they will create unassignable civil rights of action which also have counterpart criminal offences. The new provisions will complement the 1986 amendments made to the Act in relation to piracy and will also indirectly provide performers with greater bargaining power when negotiating contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Complementary regulations which are proposed will extend the operation of the new provisions to citizens, nationals and residents of countries which are members of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations (1961) and also to performances in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments, together with other proposed regulations which will extend copyright protection to foreign broadcasts, will enable Australia to meet the minimum requirements of the Rome Convention. It is the Government's intention that steps be taken towards accession to this important Convention in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Educational copying</PARA>
<PARA>Access to the literary, musical and artistic heritage is fundamental to the role of the educator and that means access to a wide range of copyright material. The Government is therefore concerned that teachers have available to them any material of educational value circulating in both the print and audio-visual media. However, this should be achieved in a manner which ensures that relevant copyright owners are justly remunerated for use of their material. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a great challenge to educators and copyright owners alike to reach agreement on this issue of educational copying. The proposed statutory licences for copying by educational institutions contained in the Bill recognise the need for educators to have easy access to copyright material for teaching purposes. They also recognise the need for copyright owners to be remunerated for the use of that material. While copyright owners should not be called upon to subsidise the educational needs of the public, there should be as few obstacles as possible to access to educational materials. The statutory licensing schemes will provide the appropriate mechanisms whereby the interests of copyright owners will be balanced against the interests of educators in the most efficient manner possible. These statutory licensing schemes are also consistent with the requirements of the international copyright conventions. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory licence: Audio-visual Copying by Educational Institutions</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the act to establish a statutory licensing scheme which will allow educational institutions and institutions assisting handicapped persons to make off-air copies of television programs in return for payment to copyright owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for these provisions is clear. TV programs are widely used by schools in the course of educational instruction. Copying enables programs to be shown at a more convenient time and to be retained for repeated use. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Copyright Act at present, however, off-air copying of TV programs by educational institutions is an infringement of copyright unless permission is obtained from relevant copyright owners. To avoid breaching copyright, it is necessary to obtain permission to copy a program from each copyright owner who has copyright in the program. There may be a number of separate rights in each program and, consequently, separate permissions are required with respect to the script, sound recording, background music, film (if pre-recorded) and the broadcast itself. This is an extremely onerous task for an institution wishing to copy a TV program. In the time normally available it is practically impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme introduced by this Bill follows recommendations in the 1986 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on Audio-visual Copying by Educational Institutions. It represents the result of extensive discussions between copyright owners, educational interests and the Government. I believe that it achieves a fair balance between the respective needs and entitlements of educational institutions and copyright owners, and I have every confidence that it will provide an effective and workable solution to the problems in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major advantages of this scheme will be its flexibility:</PARA>
<PARA> Educational institutions will be able to make off-air copies, for educational purposes, of all TV programs whether or not the programs were specifically made for educational purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright owners will be able to claim payment for the copying of their material through a single collecting society approved by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount payable to copyright owners will be as agreed between the parties or, in the absence of agreement, as decided by the Copyright Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Institutions will be able to elect to pay for the right to copy either by way of an amount per student, or according to actual material copied based on full record-keeping. In the latter case, institutions will be required to send records to the collecting society at specified intervals. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Licence: Photocopying by Educational Institutions</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this Bill will also revise the existing educational photocopying scheme. The present scheme has proved to be extremely cumbersome to operate and costly to administer because of its complex record-keeping requirements. Following expressions of dissatisfaction from both educational institutions and copyright owners, the Government examined the feasibility of a revised scheme which could operate along the same lines as the scheme for copying of TV programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst substantially preserving the range and extent of materials that may be copied, the revised scheme is based largely on voluntary agreements already entered into between Copyright Agency Limited (the authors' and publishers' collecting society) and a substantial number of educational institutions throughout Australia.

This will avoid copyright owners having to carry out time-consuming and costly record inspections at the thousands of schools spread around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The criminal penalties in the Act for offences relating to record-keeping have understandably been the subject of concern on the part of teachers. These have been substantially omitted from the revised scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> For the teachers who will have recourse to it on a daily basis, the revised scheme will in practice be much simpler to comply with. It will also substantially improve the means of remunerating copyright owners for the use of their copyright materials. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with the proposed changes to the educational photocopying scheme and the new provisions dealing with copying of TV programs by educational institutions, the Bill also includes new provisions which will streamline copying by institutions assisting handicapped readers and intellectually handicapped persons. </PARA>
<PARA>Copyright-Designs Interaction</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will update the protection given to artistic works that are either registered as designs under the Designs Act 1906 or are industrially applied without registration. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers, artists and designers of a diverse range of articles experience problems with the excessive copyright protection of `industrial' products by the Copyright Act, the uncertain operation of the legislation and its often inequitable effects. The legislation has also attracted criticism from both legal commentators and the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Government published a Discussion Paper that canvassed various options for reform, and received submissions from copyright owners and industry. The preferred solution was to remove the possibility of copyright protection for three-dimensional industrial products. It is considered that these products should be protected only under the designs legislation or other appropriate law. The Designs Law Review Committee report on the law relating to designs (1973) also reached this conclusion. The amendments introduced by the Bill will amend the Copyright Act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the so-called `non-expert defence' in the Copyright Act is to be repealed. It provides a qualified defence to infringement of the copyright owner's right to reproduce an artistic work in a different dimension. It has not operated as intended and has been the subject of much adverse judicial comment. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will not affect copyright protection for artistic works reproduced on the surface of an article, such as a T-shirt, or for buildings or `works of artistic craftsmanship' for which a design has not been registered. Thus, protection by copyright will continue for these essentially `artistic' creations (e.g. tapestry or certain craftwork). As well, the changes will not affect designs for articles excluded by regulation from registration under the Designs Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Computer Chips</PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill 1988, which protects computer chip layouts from unfair copying, is the second part of the Government's copyright reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian computer chip industry is small but important and growing. Australian chips, for example, make `bionic ears' and heart pacemakers work, detect messages from space and from the ocean and convert sunlight to power. Importantly, our specialised products have found valuable markets overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequence of the copyright-design reforms already mentioned is that copyright will be of very limited use to chip designers to protect their products against piracy. The Designs Act may apply to some parts of chip layouts but, like copyright, designs monopoly protection is not suitable for chip layouts because it is excessive. Chips are essential products in modern society. Innovators need to be able to stop unauthorised copying in order to protect their investment. However, that protection should not be at the expense of proper availability of the product for use in machinery and consumer appliances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill will repeal inappropriate and uncertain Copyright Act and Designs Act protection, and provide protection for original chip layouts along the lines of the laws passed recently in the United States, Japan, Scandinavia and European Community countries. The Bill is also consistent with the major elements of the World Intellectual Property Organisation's draft `Treaty on the Protection of Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits'. I expect this draft Treaty to be finalised at a Diplomatic Conference in Washington in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is highly desirable that this Bill be law before that Conference to ensure Australia's negotiating position is equal to that of the other countries which already have chip protection laws. </PARA>
<PARA> In the unfortunate event that the Conference does not agree on a Treaty, Australia will need to enter into bilateral arrangements. As a result of this Government's representations, Australian chips have been protected in the United States since mid 1985. However, that protection is only interim, and ends in May 1989. Enactment of the Circuits Layouts Bill is needed to obtain permanent protection for Australian circuit layouts in the important United States market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill provides modified copyright protection. It grants to the creator of an original chip layout the exclusive rights-</PARA>
<PARA> to copy the layout;</PARA>
<PARA> to make a chip in accordance with the layout (in copyright law terms `to make a three-dimensional copy of a two-dimensional work'); and</PARA>
<PARA> to first commercially exploit the layout or a chip made in accordance with such a layout. </PARA>
<PARA> The rights will, like copyright, arise `automatically'. This is a simple. low-cost form of protection involving no red tape, which is welcomed by industry and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as a short term of protection-minimum 10 years, maximum 20 years, from making-the Circuit Layouts Bill includes several significant departures from traditional copyright because of:</PARA>
<PARA> the short market life of chips;</PARA>
<PARA> the need to preserve fair competition between innovators; and</PARA>
<PARA> the fact that Australia imports most of its chips, either inside consumer products or for installation in products made here. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly,</PARA>
<PARA> importation of legitimate chips may not be prevented by the rights owner;</PARA>
<PARA> a pirate layout or chip innocently acquired may be `on-sold' by the purchaser even after he or she knows of its infringing status, provided the purchaser pays a fair fee to the rights owner; and</PARA>
<PARA> copying for `reverse engineering' is permitted, and a layout or chip made on the basis of this reverse engineering will not infringe rights in the first layout, provided it is also `original'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other matters which need to be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> First, at the request of industry, the Bill provides only civil claims as remedies for infringement. This is because chip piracy has not been a problem so far in Australia. However, should this position change, we would need to look again at introducing criminal sanctions and customs controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, unlike some foreign laws, this Bill is not limited to current chip technology. For example, there is no requirement that `masks' be used to make chips, and protection is not limited to layouts for `semiconductor' chips. It may be, however, that the Australian chip industry develops in a way not covered by this Bill. If those developments were threatened by piracy, the Government would of course give consideration to further reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that the proposal to introduce this legislation has been the subject of consultation with industry since 1985. A detailed outline of the legislation was circulated to over 40 companies and industry organisations in July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to obtain protection for its designs in the vital US and European export markets-either under the proposed Treaty or as a result of reciprocal arrangements-Australia must have a law, such as this Bill, in place as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian computer chip industry is recognised by this Government as an important, innovative and growing one. The Government is committed to fostering its development. The Circuit Layouts Bill is a significant and timely demonstration of this commitment and Australian companies-both innovative producers and users of computer chip technology-will benefit from legal certainty provided by this special legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government also recognises that in this fast moving area, its commitment must be responsive to the needs of the industry. Thus, after enactment of the Bill, it will be important to consult broadly with industry participants to ensure that the legislation achieves the desired result of providing appropriate intellectual property protection in Australia and in key export markets for the chip industry. The Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce will co-sponsor a program of consultation with industry during the first year of operation for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory licence for record manufacture</PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Act presently contains a statutory licence for the manufacture of recordings of musical works. The relevant provisions specify conditions upon which the licence operates and a mechanism for changing the rate of royalty payable to music copyright owners. This mechanism requires the Attorney-General to determine that the current rate is `inequitable'. Then there is an inquiry and report by the Copyright Tribunal. Any variation of the rate is by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the preliminary requirement for the Attorney-General to determine the current royalty rate to be `inequitable' is an undesirable and inappropriate role for Government. It is also an inappropriate role for the Governor-General to have to consider a Tribunal report and make regulations, where appropriate, to vary the rate. In 1979-80 this matter proved a very controversial one for the Attorney-General of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Copyright Amendment Bill will introduce a simplified scheme, based solely on a Copyright Tribunal determination of the rate in the absence of agreement, which will be consistent with other schemes in the Act (for example, the compulsory licence for broadcasting music). Such a scheme will have industry support and will remove unnecessary Government involvement in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Miscellaneous</PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Bill will also introduce a number of other reforms which will extend the right of the Australian Archives to copy works in its archival collection, standardise rights of review under the Act by the AAT and facilitate copyright protection for choreographic works made in the form of film or video. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 will have a minimal impact on Commonwealth revenue and expenditure. There may be some increase in revenue due to a slight expansion of the sales tax base resulting from introduction of the blank tape royalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The statutory educational copying and blank tape royalty schemes are largely self-administering. The Bill will therefore not directly lead to any increased cost to the Commonwealth. However, there is a possibility of some increased costs to the Commonwealth in relation to funding of the Copyright Tribunal, in that greater demands may be placed on the Tribunal to hear applications under those new statutory licence schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the debate was adjourned I was commenting on the fact that Time magazine published a special environment issue this week, a copy of which I have with me. I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to the wonderful painting by Arthur Boyd which graces the cover of Time magazine. It is called Earth, Fire-the Struggle for Australia. As I was saying, two of the major conservation issues highlighted in this edition of Time magazine are Western Australian issues-Shark Bay and its frustrated World Heritage potential, and Rudall River, where CRA Ltd is proving up a massive uranium deposit inside the national park and on Aboriginal land, in anticipation of a change in Australian Labor Party uranium policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even the anti-environmentalist Margaret Thatcher has apparently recognised a flaw in the unbridled capitalism for which she has been so fiercely vocal. In her own words, reported in the Advertiser:</PARA>
<PARA> The health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent on each other. </PARA>
<PARA>Conservation in the context of sustainable development obviously does not require every ecosystem to be preserved intact. It is much too late for that, even if it were our objective. With the exception of Antarctica, we are left with isolated pockets of wilderness which must be protected, and large areas of modified and degraded land which must be rehabilitated. Senator Cook's national task force on soil conservation will not work unless it is properly funded to allow representatives of regional conservation groups to sit on soil district committees and contribute to the objectives of the task force. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar need exists with Senator Cook's proposed forest accord process involving government, the timber industry and conservationists. Adequate funding must be provided to allow conservation representatives from Western Australia and other far-flung States to participate effectively in the peak accord committee, if tokenism in the forest accord is to be avoided. Staff resources and funding to carry out the critical function of liaison between conservation groups, industry and government are imperative for verbal commitment to translate into effective action. </PARA>
<PARA> Before a forest accord can be developed, however, knowledge of forest ecology, conservation requirements and the extent of usable resources must be vastly improved. Funding for the appropriate bodies, such as the Australian Heritage Commission and the CSIRO, and grants to the States must be increased to provide this necessary baseline research and to monitor the ongoing effects of logging on forest ecology, if we are fair dinkum about sustainable use of our forests. Sustainable development also requires the conservation of plant and animal species because these are not renewable resources. It also requires the minimisation of adverse impacts on natural systems, in order to sustain their function and overall integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth responsibilities to the National Estate are being neglected in many areas. In Western Australia, for example, we have mining tenements extending across national parks and wilderness areas, including D'Entrecasteaux and Rudall River national parks, and in the last remaining tuart forest, which once extended north and south of Perth. All three are on the register of the National Estate, as is Shark Bay. Shark Bay is being investigated for World Heritage nomination by a State appointed committee to prevent it from becoming an election issue before we go to the polls early next year. Meanwhile, land degradation and speculation continue unabated at Shark Bay. It is one of the areas which are detailed to some degree in the edition of Time magazine to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable development is the recognition that the earth's natural resources are part of an interconnected ecosystem and that the system-wide effects of exploitation must be accounted for in the overall budget of sustainable yield. Put another way, in assessing long term costs and benefits of proposed developments and policies, environmental effects must be given precedence, and not be treated as an afterthought. At present, environmental impact assessment is treated as an afterthought. It effectively occurs after approvals in principle have been given by the relevant Ministers and the deals with industry have been worked out. Environmental consultants are then given the job of assessing the proposed development's effects in the best light possible, for their client to clear this last hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA> While the environmental regulatory authorities do the best job possible under the existing governments' attitudes, the resulting long term environmental costs are usually left for future generations to contend with. A current example in Western Australia is a proposal by a French Government-owned company to process radioactive mineral sands and to dispose of the radiotoxic waste in ponds and shallow burial sites. From the very beginning, support and approvals in principle were given by the relevant State Minister and the then Federal Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, to facilitate the acceptance of this development. Outcries from residents and environmentalists concerning the company's inadequate environmental assessment resulted in the Government taking on the responsibility for the transport and disposal of the radioactive waste, which will be with us for thousands of years. The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) recommended against this environmentally damaging stage 2, and so far the Government says that it accepts the EPA's findings. Whether or not this process results in the project being scrapped, as residents would like, it has been expensive because environmental considerations have been left until last. </PARA>
<PARA> Within a sustainable world view, the lifestyles of most young professionals in Australia would be defined as overdeveloped. The agricultural resources alone to support an average Australian's eating habits amount to five times that required by an average Indian, Nigerian or Colombian. The conversion of grain to meat, as well as overeating and wastage, accounts for much of the difference. Apparently, the average American carries nearly 10 tonnes of steel around with him or her in cars and household equipment. Hundreds of kilograms of additional metals and plastics are contained in various appliances and so-called necessities. In addition, some 300 kilograms of wrappings, bottles and cans are used and thrown away per year per person. Judging from the roadside litter and the love of disposables in the Parliament House of Australia, I would not think the rates would be much less in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to generating nasty lifestyle diseases and degrading our environment, this pattern of development has serious implications for the majority of the world's people, who live in underdeveloped nations. At the source of violent conflict is insecurity, and the real sources of insecurity encompass unsustainable development and resource inequities between classes, races, genders and nations. Development is not a neutral factor in this equation. Its value lies in how it is achieved; that is, at what cost to the environment and future generations. For example, the arms race has grossly distorted the development of science and technology, because approximately 25 per cent of the world's scientists are directly engaged in military research and so-called development. In the United States of America, over 60 per cent of all Federal research and development funding went to aerospace and defence programs in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, Commission for the Future Chairperson, Dr Ian Lowe, pointed out that because some 90 per cent of Australian energy research is funded by the Commonwealth Government, it is critical to ask whether the thrust of energy research is consistent with sustainable resource use and the public interest. Traditionally, there has been a heavy emphasis on supply technologies while neglecting the social, political and economic factors affecting energy demand. The Government's Energy 2000 document does little to reverse this trend. Despite repeated calls from the academic, scientific and environmental communities to adopt an energy policy to provide central direction for appropriate research, and the enormous challenge posed by the greenhouse effect to change our mode of resource use, this Government has refused to provide the needed direction. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's commitment to a balance between development and conservation in Australia is going to require money up front-more money than we are accustomed to spending on our life support systems but less than if we keep putting off the debt. We do that at our peril, and we do future generations a great disservice if, as a nation, we ignore warning signs and continue only to mouth platitudes rather than getting on with the real change of direction, setting new priorities and adequately funding them. That is the Government's responsibility, if it looks further than the next election. Young Australians have a right to look to us, as elected representatives of the people, and I believe they have a right to expect an all-party push for the care of our environment. It should not be too much to expect. After all, we do not inherit the earth from our forefathers, but we are mere borrowers of the earth from our children. A most important and serious task is for us to be good stewards of this fragile yet beautiful environment. Surely, there is enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating these Appropriation Bills, I would like to address in particular the subject of appropriations for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The veteran community in this country is not happy. Probably more than anything else, veterans resent the fact that they have to fight with the Department for every so-called entitlement. In other words, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, their Department so to speak, is too often the adversary rather than the advocate of the veterans' cause. This role reversal must be rectified. It has become only too apparent to me that there is a growing dissatisfaction and suspicion among veterans. They believe, rightly, that this Government has decided that the time has come to begin the process of merging veterans' administration into welfare at large, a process already begun by hospital mergers. Despite denials and despite some modest acknowledgment of special needs, for instance in relation to Vietnam veterans counselling, the trend of the past few years has been to contract the range of veterans' entitlements and to contract effectiveness of dollars expended in this portfolio. These trends have given rise to suspicion, resentment and disillusionment in attitudes which are now directed at both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give just one powerful illustration of this negative attitude of veterans towards the Department. In the last three issues of the newsletter of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, titled Debrief, there has been a series of articles which have given vent to this unfortunate disillusionment and distrust. I would like to quote from some of those articles. Under the heading `Chieu Hoi Charleys Debrief', subheaded `Doings at the Department-Vetaffairs Dirty Tricks Department' a review recently analysed the attitude of the Department towards veterans' claims for entitlement. I quote from page 11 of the last issue of Debrief:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent times considerable attention has been focused on the existence of a `cell' of bright young legal eagles operating within the wong-towered auspices of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Canberra. The principal function of this `cell', which I can assure you does indeed exist-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the assurance of the author-</PARA>
<PARA>is to make veterans fight every inch of the way and incur as much expense as possible in order to obtain the benefits which are rightfully theirs under current veterans legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The ``cell'', or to give it its correct title of the ``Advocacy Branch'' approaches its task by ``going for the jugular'' at every opportunity it gets. In the process, it is making a mockery of established approaches to the administration of remedial legislation and the claim by its employing department that ``Vetaffairs cares''. The veteran community is regarded as the ``enemy''-to be defeated whenever possible and by any means possible. A review of a number of recent appeal cases heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) and the Veterans' Review Board (VRB) should serve to illustrate my point. </PARA>
<PARA>This article goes on to vent the animosity and disillusionment of veterans concerning the administration of `their department' and of legislation in relation to `their entitlement'. Much to the indictment of the Department, it cites a series of cases where this attitude would appear to prevail. It cites the case of John Elliott and the Repatriation Commission centring on the rather controversial concept of the application and the application day. It cites the case of Fitzmaurice and the Repatriation Commission. It cites the case of McMaugh and the Repatriation Commission. It cites the case of McGuine and the Repatriation Commission where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the same band of intellectual giants argued that a digger who had been forced to give up work due to his accepted disabilities should have his assessment reduced to reflect an ``absence of work related stress''. The Tribunal was unimpressed. Perhaps understandably so. </PARA>
<PARA>They argue that:</PARA>
<PARA>The same line of reasoning would see a double amputee's pension reduced because he didn't need to buy as many socks, or a bed-ridden digger's pension reduced because he didn't need to buy clothing or footwear. They never give up!</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting from the newsletter of a veterans' group-the most recent veterans-which exhibits their attitude towards their Department administering their legislation. The resentment is extraordinary and the last three issues of this newsletter ooze, build up, stack up and express this resentment. It is real. The newsletter quotes the case of Repatriation Commission v. Law-that is now the infamous Nancy Law case-as well as the Repatriation Commission v. H. Lee. I will continue to quote from just the last of these newsletters which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a recent VRB case an advocate really did his homework, and hit the Board with an ancient Latin maxim in arguing that a digger's service-related smoking habit amounted to ``volenti non fit injuria (a voluntary assumption of a risk). If taken to the limit, this argument would deny benefits to any diggers who enlisted voluntarily or did something ``about and beyond the call of duty''. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, the same article says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the Department's Advocacy Branch is not concerned with the proper administration of the Act. It has instead declared ``open season'' on what it sees as ``repat bludgers'' in order to save the Department's precious money. Every pension and entitlement to treatment knocked back means money saved. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in order to realise its goals, the Advocacy Branch is operating in a manner akin to a bunch of corporate lawyers engaged in a big-business litigation. Typically, this type of litigation is conducted on a no-holds-barred basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on, but it is simply sad to see documented in this way, and so recently, the resentment and bitterness that typify the attitude of ex-diggers and veterans to the administration of their Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in the other place the honourable member for Reid, Mr Tom Uren, expressed his resentment about the attitude of his own Cabinet and his own Ministers in relation to the administration of the Department. I quote from Mr Uren's speech on 20 October 1988 in the other place, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>However, my remarks today are strong criticism of those Ministers in the Hawke Cabinet who I have often described as having cash registers for hearts and little understanding or compassion for war veterans or their widows. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a member of the present Government, a former Minister, speaking of the attitude of the present Government specifically to ex-prisoners of war. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This speech is not about reparations from the Japanese Government but about justice from our own Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a powerful speech and I would recommend it to members of the Government, the Opposition and the public as a genuine statement of a concerned Government member about the attitude of his own Government towards veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate on 8 December 1987 I referred to a brief paper which had been prepared and circulated by veterans' groups in my State of New South Wales entitled `Summary of Losses by Veterans between 1985 and 1987'. I took the article on trust at the time, as I do now, and invited correction by the Minister should it be in error. No corrections were forthcoming. That document cited 18 areas in which veterans' entitlements and circumstances have been eroded since the May statement of 1985 through the veterans' entitlements Acts of 1986 and 1987 and the economic statement of May 1988. Some of those erosions of entitlement which I cited are as follows: the deletion of dependants' pensions; the reductions in pharmaceutical entitlements for red card holders; the reduction in dental benefits; the deletion of 10 per cent disability pension assistance when glasses are prescribed; restrictions on the issue of glasses; intermediate or special rate disability pensions that have come under fire; non-reimbursement rights when obtaining supporting medical opinions; absolutely unacceptable criteria inherent in the guide to assessment of entitlements which, fortunately, has been reviewed, but the reviews are yet to come into effect and the change of the system has yet to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other erosions include the offensive life-styles questionnaire which, fortunately, also has come under review but the effectiveness of that review is yet to be assessed; the means testing of the veterans' children's education scheme; the deletion of the intellectually handicapped dependants' allowance; freezing of the social security portion of war widows' pensions; and restriction of travel and mileage allowance for veterans when attending review boards or presenting the case for their entitlements. These are 13 of the 18 cited areas in which pensioners' entitlements have been eroded in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Government's recent actions have been more hurtful than others. The one that rocked us all was the introduction of the $117 per week for nursing home care levied on totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners presently in nursing homes. This small group of people-there are only about 750 of them-have always been regarded as special Australians who deserve our special gratitude. Yet, cruelly, on 1 January 1988, the beginning of the great celebration of the nation, the Government changed its attitude towards these people and served them, for the first time, with a Bill of $117 per week for the rest of their lives. I believe that that was a shameful act. I tried to stop it by an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Bill but, sadly, my amendment was defeated by the combined vote of the Government, the Liberals and the Nationals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is quite specific and tangible evidence of the Government's attitude to veterans generally, and of the Opposition's collusion with the Government to spend as little as possible on veterans. There are also many people in our veterans' community who are very dissatisfied because they feel they should be entitled to benefits which the Government denies them. The merchant seamen who survived the most dangerous and deplorable conditions during war are currently battling the Department for adequate recognition of their status as veterans. Even though such acknowledgment has been granted by other allies, the Government still has not acknowledged the equality in all wars of women who served in combat zones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was probing the depths of disillusionment out in the veteran community concerning the attitude of the present Government towards veterans' entitlements, particularly the way in which the Veterans' Entitlements Act is being administered by the Department at the moment and the fact that it seems to be locked into an adversary role rather than an advocacy role. Unfortunately, in some of these battles the Opposition has gone with the Government in opposing amendments to entitlements. All in all, there is very widespread disillusionment in the veteran community. In fact, I had cited the last three editions of the Vietnam Veterans Association newsletter Debrief which documents in some measure the extent of that ill feeling that is prevailing at the moment. I had cited 18 areas in which veterans' entitlements have been eroded since 1985. This process of erosion, together with the posture being adopted by the Department and the Minister in relation to veterans' entitlements-the fact that veterans have to fight so hard and vigorously to overcome every resistance to gain those entitlements-has served only to entrench the resentment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I was in the process of citing a number of specific groups that have not as yet won those entitlements. I had made reference to the fact that, for instance, the women who served in combat zones in wars have not yet achieved equal status to males who served in those zones. I cited the fact that the merchant seamen who made such profound sacrifices have not yet gained equal entitlements to other veterans. The Vietnam Medal is being sought by members of the HMAS Sydney Veterans and Logistic Support Group and by Vietnam war correspondents but they continue to be denied the right to wear a decoration to which they believe they are totally entitled. Even though they have all other entitlements, they are being denied the right to wear medals that they believe are rightfully theirs and they are very resentful of this denial. </PARA>
<PARA> In a series of questions in this place over the last few months I have indicated that it has even been suggested that a number of those veterans, by virtue of their being members of their organisation, belong to a subversive organisation. Even though that accusation has been profoundly denied the two co-founders of the organisation in question have suffered dire consequences. One has been forced to resign from the Naval Reserve and one has been forced to resign from a State police force, and they attribute the need to resign to the fact that they are supposedly branded as subversives. As extraordinary as such an accusation might seem, that is what these people truly believe about the reaction to their fighting for their entitlements as veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there is the continuing saga of the nuclear veterans' fight for their rights. The Johnston case, which is a key deliberation in relation to the rights of nuclear veterans, is before the New South Wales Supreme Court at the moment. I cannot comment in detail beyond saying that it will cost the taxpayer millions of dollars in legal fees and other costs, probably ultimately denying Mr Johnston what he and his fellow nuclear veterans have always believed since they took part in the tests at Maralinga to be their rightful entitlements as veterans, even though Britain has long since acknowledged the entitlement of its nuclear veterans to such veterans' privileges. It is quite possible that the Government will spend literally tenfold what it would cost it to grant this man and his colleagues their entitlements. It will spend that much in order to deny that entitlement through court action. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course a number of national servicemen believe that, even though they did not serve in Vietnam, they are being discriminated against because they have not received some of the entitlements, such as access to housing loans, which were extended to Vietnam veterans even though it was not by virtue of their having served in Vietnam that they gained such entitlements. So we have numerous examples of people who believe that they are truly entitled to such entitlements not gaining them, and who have been fighting those battles for or in excess of 20 years. They will continue to fight those battles and I will continue to support them in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Several things are worth noting about the plight of the nuclear veterans. There are very few of them and it would cost the Government so little to acknowledge their service. Britain has long since acknowledged the entitlements of its equivalents and the McClelland Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia between 1952 and 1963 assembled vast evidence in their support. Here is a further example of a `cash register for a heart' phenomenon which was so powerfully referred to by the Hon. Tom Uren in the other place and to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Merchant seamen, Vietnam logistic support groups, nuclear veterans and some national servicemen all feel neglected, denied and abandoned by a Government that purports to support the entitlements of veterans. So many who are entitled feel offended by continued and persistent rejection by the very Minister and Department supposedly serving their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think two relevant analogies could be drawn. Firstly, the Government's attitude to the findings of the Evatt Royal Commission on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam is indicative of its attitude towards veterans in general. Faced with an overwhelming and growing mass of evidence that the findings of the Royal Commission are flawed beyond redemption, the Government has chosen to bury its collective head in the sand and to hope that the problem will go away, thereby spending as little money on veterans as possible. The Government's attitude to veterans in general is, `Do not do anything and, if you are compelled to do something, fight the veteran tooth and nail'-through the Department's so-called advocacy branch-`before you are forced to give to the veteran any benefits or entitlements'. Little wonder, therefore, that the resentment of the magnitude that I cited earlier is now beginning to express itself in the veteran community. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the way in which the Government treats veterans is linked inextricably to the manner in which the Government treats members of the Defence Force, which I spoke about earlier in today's urgency motion debate. It is no wonder that the morale of the Australian Defence Force has plummeted and that rates of wastage are massive. I spent almost 20 years of my life in and around the Army, including the Vietnam years. I know veterans and I know how veterans view the Department of Veterans' Affairs at the moment. Indeed, how veterans must inevitably view this Department has to be quite obvious to any person of sensitivity. Any dealing with the Department is another battle in a very long war for entitlement. At the moment the Department seems to be winning, keeping expenditure to an absolute minimum at the expense of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious to all of us involved with the veteran community that the Government intends, after the next election, to disband the Department of Veterans' Affairs and distribute its responsibilities between the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Social Security, keeping on the Repatriation Commission as an advisory body. The transfer of repatriation hospitals to the States, years earlier than promised, is the first swift step in that direction. The Government appears to be doing everything it can to further erode veterans' status as special individuals with special needs and, therefore, accelerating and easing the transition out of the specialty Department of Veterans' Affairs to the general welfare umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Democrats are concerned, this just is not good enough. Veterans are entitled to a special place in our society. That has been acknowledged by foregoing governments and that promise must be abided by. We cannot ask people to risk their lives in the service of their country and then desert them when and if they return home. We should not be treating these people, as is far too often the case, as an annoyance to be dealt with as quickly as possible and frustrating them in their pursuit of their entitlements. When the honourable member for Reid, Mr Tom Uren, described these people-and they were his own people, his own Cabinet-as `having cash registers for hearts' and as `having little understanding or compassion for war veterans or their widows', he was absolutely accurate. Sadly, but accurately, he was referring to members of the present Cabinet and Government and to the responsible Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document introduced to Parliament on 23 August to which the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-89 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1988-89, which we are debating this evening, give effect was not a Budget. A Budget is a blueprint for the management of the economy in the year to come. This document was a fraud, a put-up job, a false prospectus, a `Paul for PM' prospectus. Its purpose was to create phoney euphoria, front page headlines proclaiming that the world's greatest Treasurer had done it again. The media and others whom it was meant to deceive swallowed it hook, line and sinker-or should I say, Hawke, line and sinker. Who can forget the display of spleen and envy by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the following day? But it all came unstuck. Regrettably, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) counted his votes for the leadership challenge on the same fingers and toes he used to calculate the inflation rate and the balance of payments deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, all that I have said might be totally wrong. The Treasurer and the Government, as the sponsors of this Budget, might not be guilty of fraud and deception at all, but guilty merely of massive incompetence. It has to be one or the other. How else do we explain a forecast inflation rate of 4.5 per cent and a current rate headed for 6 to 8 per cent-an actual rate of 7.3 per cent at the end of the September quarter? How else do we explain a Budget forecast balance of payments deficit of $9.5 billion compared with the currently projected figure of $12 billion after October's second highest ever deficit of $1.69 billion? The one the Government got right, the forecast of a stronger Australian dollar in 1988-89, turns out to be an equal indictment of incompetence. The dollar is stronger-not because of a stronger economy, but rather because a panic stricken Government tightened monetary policy, jacked up interest rates and invited a consequent inflow of foreign money. </PARA>
<PARA> Remember on Budget night the Treasurer's preening and lipsmacking claim that he was bringing home the bacon? This Budget turns out to be another part of a pig's anatomy-and he cannot blame anyone else. He cannot blame the usual litany of fall guys: Howard, Fraser, Menzies-Billy Hughes! He cannot invoke the usual Keating cop-out that his forecasts were made in good faith and overtaken by unexpected economic deterioration, because at the time the Budget was handed down a survey of 40 academic and business economists set out average forecasts that were much more pessimistic and, as we see, much more accurate than the Treasurer's. Keating predicted growth at 3.5 per cent; the experts said it would be 2.7 per cent. Inflation, Paul told us, would be 4.5 per cent. The professionals said that it would be 5.7 per cent. The Treasurer put the balance of payments deficit at $9.5 billion. The unbiased opinion of people who do this sort of thing for a living was $10.6 billion. They were optimistic, weren't they? But then, these expert economists were not surveying the mantlepieces at the Lodge for the best spot to park an antique French clock. Their priorities did not include a by-election in Oxley and getting John Cain back in Victoria before the Victorian Economic Development Corporation hit the fan. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Australian economy is dangerously vulnerable because this Government has abandoned the real job of economic management for a desperate and dishonest exercise in manipulating the political agenda. The needs of the Australian people run second to getting Bob and Paul re-elected. Thus, in the lead-up to the Adelaide, Port Adelaide and Groom by-elections and the New South Wales State election, this Government eased monetary policy and forced down interest rates. As a result, we are failing to reap the full benefits of commodity price improvements, and the balance of payments deficit runs $3 billion higher than under a realistic monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Only days before the Victorian State election we had Keating, Hawke and even the Governor of the Reserve Bank anticipating that interest rates would fall. Only days afterwards interest rates exploded. And who were the participants in that process? They were the same people who gave us the fudge-it Budget-the Canberra branch of the Dodgy brothers, Keating and Hawke. But for all the sleight of hand and hype, this Government can no longer hide from the Australian people the central fact of Australian politics today-that in a period of unparalleled international economic growth, the Hawke Labor Government has presided over a massive decline in the living standards of ordinary Australians. Although money wages have risen at twice the rate of those of our trading partners, the average weekly wage earner with a dependent spouse and two children needs a tax cut of $56 a week to restore the same disposable income he enjoyed when Labor came to power in March 1983. He needs $56 a week, or one-sixth of the Treasurer's travelling allowance. There are two reasons for this. </PARA>

The outline of that policy already gives enough detail to indicate the directions in which we will head. The more specific details will be released at an appropriate time and will ensure that the honourable senator's Government is defeated at the next election. Before I was interrupted by the honourable senator, I was saying that there are two reasons for the fall in living standards: lack of productivity improvement and excessive taxation. We pay ourselves more and become less competitive. The end result is to fuel inflation. And who benefits from that? The Treasurer's coffers benefit through that fiscal phenomenon, bracket creep. People receive an illusory wage rise that simply pushes them into a higher tax bracket. Their income is no higher in real terms because of inflation, but they lose a bigger slice of it in tax. From this bracket creep rort alone the Treasurer has ripped an extra $8 billion a year out of taxpayers' pockets. Next year it will be $10 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is late with his returns and he maintains that travelling allowance rort. Since coming to office the Hawke Government has introduced over 300 taxation measures. That is better than one a week. Those designed to increase the tax take outnumber those designed to reduce it by 2 : 1. We have had new taxes: the capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, entertainment tax, and the Medicare levy. Let us not forget the boomerang tax: the airport arrivals tax that comes back to us via the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been tax intrusions into new areas. There is sales tax on citrus drinks, wine and flavoured milk. The tax on superannuation and the taxes on Telecom Australia and Australia Post amount to backdoor taxation of essential services. This Government has invented tax by stealth in the form of automatic indexation of excise on beer and cigarettes, and of passport charges. It has abolished worthwhile rebates and concessions on health insurance and housing interest and reduced the depreciation allowance for farmers and industry. If it breathes, tax it; if it works, tax it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the life of the Hawke Government inflation and average weekly earnings have increased by some 50 per cent. But personal income tax is up by 107 per cent; company income taxes have increased by 133 per cent; and sales tax is up by 147 per cent and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder people cannot get ahead. No wonder people are starting to draw comparisons between the current catastrophe and the last days of the Whitlam Government. But even at Whitlam's worst we were spared the sight of Gough sunning himself in his Speedos on a banana lounge at Kirribilli House. That was the response of the Prime Minister to the September balance of trade setback. It is his only response: `Trust me. Trust the Treasurer'-even though they do not trust each other-`Get yourself a banana lounge, sit in the sun and wait for the tax cuts'. </PARA>
<PARA> But do not hold your breath. The truth is that this Government's mismanagement has turned the long awaited tax cuts into a mirage. Much needed and greatly deserved as they are, we are already being softened up to expect less-much less, if anything at all. Or does the Treasurer have a secret weapon, a Commissioner of Taxation who has seen too many Rambo movies, who declares he will override the law of the land to maximise his tax take? Have Mr Boucher's instructions come from above perhaps? `Grab every cent you can off them by hook or by crook, no matter who gets hurt, to fatten up our surplus this year. We will use it to fund the tax cuts on the eve of the next election, even if we have to give most of it back later through appeals, after we are re-elected'. Keating has collected so much Louis XIV he thinks he is Louis XIV. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to two prime causes of the shameful fall in living standards under this Government. After excessive taxation, the second of these causes lies in Australia's poor productivity performance. This can be traced directly to our outdated industrial relations structure. At the National Press Club in May this year Mr Keating declared that the Government's policy objective was to create a flexible industrial relations system in which wages and conditions reflect the different levels of prosperity of various industries. He called this the most important remaining area of reform. In June, at the Australian Labor Party National Conference in Hobart, barely a month later, Mr Keating made no reference whatsoever to labour market reform. What happened to it? Did he lose it at the roulette table or was it traded off in yet another of Labor's interminable backroom deals?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we might ask questions about that too. Living standards have fallen and will continue to fall because Australia is economically uncompetitive, because our industrial relations system is entirely inadequate for the latter part of the twentieth century, as are most creations of the early 1900s. The last thing business and workers need in today's economic circumstances is a system of built-in conflicts, centralised wage movements and ever-broadening barriers of protectionism. The new Industrial Relations Act debated here only a few weeks ago enshrines the Hawke Government's failure to act on its own agenda. That legislation bears all the hallmarks of those de facto Cabinet members Crean and Kelty. It will deny Australia the chance under this Government to develop the greater cooperation between employers and employees at the workplace level which is essential to lift productivity and so improve living standards. Real industrial relations reform will have to await the election of a coalition government. This, we know, will take place about a fortnight after the tax cuts, or lack of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A coalition government will deregulate industrial relations and tackle the hard areas, like the national embarrassment that passes for our waterfront, where four officers who dislike Fijian politics can close a major port; where 16,000 containers are tied up on our wharves; where nick-off days on full pay and chronic overmanning are standard work practices costing the Australian people and economy millions of dollars. The Castle Bacon case is a step in the right direction. It demonstrates that, despite this Government's neglect, at long last the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is beginning to understand what voluntary agreements are all about. At last we see legal recognition that workers and management have mutual interests and that the interests of workers often differ from those of union officials who claim to speak for them. For all Treasurer Keating's rhetoric, it was Castle who brought home the bacon. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the Australian economy remains afloat, it reflects no credit on this Government; it is due simply to the hard work and international competitiveness of our rural producers. Rising commodity prices alone have saved the Treasurer's bacon, and even these in Australian dollar terms have been largely offset by the fall in the American dollar. Again, for all the Treasurer's rhetoric, what we have to thank for this immediate relief is the American drought and the situation of shrinking world stocks. It is some economic management, when Australia's living standards depend on whether it rains in Kansas! Prices continue to rise and seasonal conditions have been generally good so far this year, with the tragic exception of South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, to which this Government turns an ungrateful blind eye. </PARA>
<PARA> The gross value of rural production is forecast to increase by 9 per cent to $21.6 billion in 1988-89. While this is welcome, do not forget that last fiscal year the gross value of rural production remained stagnant at zero growth. In fact, according to the September 1988 issue of the Quarterly Review of the Rural Economy, gross value of crops has increased a meagre 5.6 per cent over the six years since 1983-84. So just as the Government misread the strength of the commodity prices boom over the last two years, it is now relying too heavily on that improvement. It ignores the potential tapering off in world economic activity and commodity demand. It ignores a possible fall in world inflation, possible increases in United States interest rates and financial market instability. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing is that Australia's difficulties are essentially unnecessary. They could be overcome by the right policy initiatives, and they will be. The last time Australia was competitive with other developed economies, the last time our inflation rate was below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, was in the early 1980s under the Fraser coalition Government with John Howard as Treasurer; the next time will be under a coalition government led by John Howard. In the meantime, I suggest the Treasurer should forget about the Prime Ministership until he can cope with prime numbers. I suggest this Government should learn the differences between a responsible Budget and vanity publishing, and I suggest we give these Bills the title they deserve-the misappropriation Bills. For these reasons the Opposition amendment warrants the strong support of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I think that says it all. There are two areas to which I wish to direct my attention tonight. The first is taxation and the second is program budgeting. The European countries are moving with ever-increasing speed towards the constitution in 1992 of a European community of trading nations which will be perhaps the biggest and most effective trading market in the world, involving 350 million people. There is great fear that it will become a `fortress Europe' and defend itself by imposing high protection barriers against other countries. I think these fears are exaggerated because the lifeblood of the Economic Community will be trade. It will have problems in working out what trading language and currency to use. Undoubtedly, these matters will be resolved quickly and Australia will be faced with this new trading bloc. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last week there has been an election in Canada. The issue in that election was closer trading relations with the United States of America. Undoubtedly, Canada and the United States will become a huge trading bloc. Certainly, to some extent the reason is the fact that they see a need to consolidate, to act as some kind of foil or counterfoil to what is happening in Europe. The European trading community will form one of the most important trading blocs that the world has ever seen. It will be bigger than, for example, the Soviet Union and it will certainly be bigger than Japan or China. Australia must face up to a reorientation of the whole of its business arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that none of the countries of Europe are particularly concerned with the future of Australia. However, I think Australia should be concerned with the developments that are happening around the world, such as the advent of this European Economic Community. We cannot rely on old trading agreements and favoured nation status as we did in the past for assurance of our markets. Companies that want to get involved in the European Economic Community will have to start making joint venture agreements and other agreements with companies in countries that are already involved in the European Economic Community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I want to talk about tax. Australia, being a common law country, has developed policies concerning what is income and what is capital according to our old common law philosophies. These have been outdated by the new mercantile trading world into which we are moving and into which all other countries have moved. If we are to have lead in our saddlebags of our taxation laws, that will put Australia at a trading disadvantage and will affect foreign investment in Australia. For example, if we do not have the same tax structures as other countries, there will be no incentive to invest in Australia. If we do not get involved in the tax harmonisation measures that are taking place in the world today, Australia will have big problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the difference between capital and income, which is regarded entirely differently in other countries. The starting-up expenses of a company in Australia are regarded as capital expenses; overseas, these expenses are able to be deducted either immediately or rapidly over a period of five years. This is an important measure because overseas it attracts innovation and updating of machinery, plant and factories. In Australia, we do not have that incentive. Expenses for intangibles, such as good will and patents, are not regarded as a disposable expense in Australia. They are regarded as part of capital, whereas overseas they are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian tax laws are discriminating against equity capital-the capital that is required of people who want to invest in a business. It is discriminating against the starting up of companies. In Europe the costs of buying good will, trade names, trademarks or other intangibles of a wasting nature are deductible over a very short period, perhaps five years. In Australia, they are not; they are regarded as capital. In Australia, we have a restricted number of those intangibles. They are deductable, but over a much longer period, which is to Australia's disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the matter of capital losses, in Australia one is only allowed to deduct those losses against capital gains. Again, this is different from what occurs in Europe, where capital losses can be deducted against trading profits. In Europe, capital gains can be rolled over, so long as the gain on the sale of an asset is reinvested in a replacement asset. For example, when a replacement for a factory is acquired, this is allowed as a capital gains deduction. That facility promotes modernisation and innovation, whereas in Australia the roll-over of replacement assets is available only when the original asset is destroyed, perhaps by fire, or compulsorily taken over. </PARA>
<PARA> To bring Australia's tax laws into line with those of Europe, it would be necessary to allow for the deduction of provisions for employees' accrued leave, for repairs when deterioration occurs-not when repairs are carried out, as is presently the case-and for bad debts based on previous experience. Naturally, these provisions could lead to abuse, but surely, in order to catch up with what is happening overseas, we have the wit to control such abuses. Actually, a single rate of tax in Australia would solve a lot of these problems, but insufficient people support that concept. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar trend has occurred with regard to tariff harmonisation over the last 20 years throughout the world. Many countries, including Australia, now subscribe to a policy of tariff harmonisation. This has been to the benefit of trade. The same situation exists with regard to taxation in Australia. We should have tax harmonisation in Australia in order to give our companies a chance to compete on the world market and in order to be in a position to attract foreign investment, so that our tax laws are in harmony with those of other countries. Pressures will arise to implement this policy, and I am sure Australia will move to adopt it. I think it would be to Australia's advantage if we adopted it of our own volition rather than waiting to have it forced on us and our having to catch up with what is happening overseas in the new mercantile trading world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the distortions that have occurred in our economy over recent years has been the debt financing of takeovers of profitable businesses in order to obtain a tax advantage. Wherever one finds there is a substantial tax advantage, it distorts the economy because people try to achieve it. Curiously, in Australia the companies that have been the best prey for this type of raid were the ones that had no debts, were completely paid off, were earning profits, paying dividends and paying taxes. Entrepreneurs found that by borrowing money, frequently from overseas, they could buy these companies, which put the companies suddenly into debt. They were no longer paying dividends or taxes. They were still making profits, but all of the profits were going overseas in order to pay off the debts and the interest on those debts. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is not the fault of the companies. It is the fault of our archaic taxation system. We are seeing that this very day with business entrepreneurs from Australia trying to buy into companies overseas with debt financing. We are seeing it with the breweries in Scotland at the moment, and the attempted Lonrho purchase. The people who are subject to these raids are worried because they say that they are being bought by debt financiers. They are profitable companies that have an income and can afford to pay off the debt. But our financiers from Australia think that they are brilliant men. Because of the tax advantage of being able to deduct the interest on the huge loans that they get to buy these companies they see it as an economic deal. People overseas do not. They are calling for inquiries into the liquidity of the companies that are attempting to purchase them. That is not the fault of the entrepreneurs. It is not the fault of the company. It is the fault of the tax system which is distorting the type of business being done. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Senate to consider the complete dissociation from reality of our Taxation Office in Australia today, and particularly the Commissioner of Taxation. I would like to quote his words:</PARA>
<PARA>A continuing source of concern to me is the proportion of time, effort and top brain power some of Australia's largest corporations and wealth holders devote to the protection of wealth from the claims of society-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in relation to taxation-</PARA>
<PARA>compared with that they devote to the creation of wealth. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>How much greater a nation might we become if this time and talent were devoted to creating more real wealth, rather than squirrelling away what the rest of the community is entitled to share through taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the most negative approach any tax office could have to the stimulation of incentive and business development in any country. I am reminded of the Roman Empire which had tax commissioners in every village and every town but they were not allowed to collect more tax than the people were willing to pay. If they did, the people were entitled to kill them. The Roman Empire flourished for 500 years until it started to collect too much tax. This is what is happening here and it is reflected in the attitude of the Australian Taxation Office which is completely anti-business. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987-88 the Australian Taxation Office collected $60 billion, which was an increase of nearly 15 per cent on the year before. This year it will collect $68 billion, which is up another 14 per cent on the previous year. The Commissioner says that the Australian Taxation Office is a successful business. That is entirely untrue; it is a parasite on business. It is a necessary one and I do not argue that point. It is his attitude and the way in which he is going around attacking business at the moment that I disagree with. The Commissioner says that it is a successful business and under the Treasurer's instructions he is coming down on businesses like a ton of bricks and treating them all as crooks. This is no way to get the business community to respond and earn money. The Taxation Commissioner himself is making increasingly stringent and, worse, unpredictable rulings. He is losing court case after court case as harassed citizens take him to court. Not only that, the Commissioner is attracting the wrath and the admonition of the judiciary in Australia for instigating these cases against business people in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great breakdown in the relationship between the people and the Taxation Office in Australia. I see this as a fearful thing in this country. We should be agreeable to paying taxes but if the tax rates are too high everybody will revolt against them. The whole problem of widespread rorts, tax minimisation schemes and the fringe benefits tax was brought about by high tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of lowering the tax rates and giving people incentive to get on, make more money and generate more business, the Government has turned around and started to tax fringe benefits, capital gains and every other thing. That is just making the whole situation worse. The Government does not recognise the initial problem. The vast bulk of the increased revenue that is accruing to the Taxation Office right now is coming from people because their incomes have edged up into higher tax brackets which attract higher tax. By the time people have paid their tax, their mortgage interest and any interest they have on any other loan, they have very little left. This is the reason for the standard of living dropping as it has in Australia today. People are not prepared to work harder because if they do they pay higher tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a common misconception, aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party, that it is the big companies that are getting away with high profits to the detriment of the working man. But nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the bulk of the taxes are paid by the bulk of the people. If one took all the profits of the top 100 companies in Australia today, not just their tax but every skerrick of their profits, that would run the Government for only a few weeks, which is not a very long time. The main tax comes from the bulk of the people, the pay as you earn taxpayers. They are paying more tax because they are going into higher tax brackets. In 1957 the number of taxpayers with a tax rate of 40 per cent or higher was one in 50. In 1987 it was one in two. Those figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming into office the Hawke Labor Government has introduced over 300 taxation measures. Those designed to increase taxation have outnumbered those designed to decrease taxation by two to one. The Government has used various methods to increase taxes. There have been four new taxes: the capital gains tax; the fringe benefits tax; the entertainment tax; and the Medicare levy. There have been three extensions of taxes into new areas. They have been the sales tax on citrus products, wine, flavoured milk, et cetera; the superannuation taxes; and the tax on Telecom Australia and Australia Post. Three measures have been introduced to bring about automatic indexation of taxes: the excise on beer and cigarettes; fees for passports; and petrol taxes. There have been three abolitions of rebates and concessions: the abolition of the health insurance rebate, the abolition of housing interest rebates and the reduction of the depreciation allowance for farmers and industry. So far as bracket creep is concerned, the Government has let inflation push wage earners into higher and higher tax brackets. As a result of this concerted effort, taxes have increased dramatically since Labor came to office. For example, personal income taxes are up 107 per cent, company income taxes are up 133 per cent and sales taxes are up 147 per cent. During the same period inflation and average weekly earnings have gone up by about 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for tax. Before my time expires, I want to say a few words on program budgeting. Although there is a renewed emphasis on budgetary and financial management in the Commonwealth Government, program budgeting has been less than effective as an enhancement of budgetary documentation. Better information on programs, program objectives and performance indicators is essential if Parliament and Senate Estimates committees in particular are to carry out expenditure control. The Audit Act of 1901 places responsibility for the control and coordination of the Commonwealth's financial transactions on the Minister for Finance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall cause to be kept proper accounts and records of receipts of, and payment out of, public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA>It stated further:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall, after the expiration of each month of each financial year publish a Statement of Financial Transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>It then stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall prepare a statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund during that year in respect of each Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The administrative arrangements order placed responsibility for the examination and evaluation of expenditure proposals and programs with the Department of Finance. The Department is also responsible for the collection and review of Forward Estimates. Announcing a reassessment of Budget documents in the paper Budget Performance: A Statement of the Government's Achievements and Intentions in Reforming the Australian Government Financial Administration, April 1984, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government produces a very comprehensive set of budget documents. However, some were developed many years ago and, as a result, parts of the documents have outlived their original purpose and need to be reassessed as to their relevance to contemporary requirements. There are areas of duplication in the documents which will need to be eliminated; related information will need to be consolidated in meaningful and usable ways; the documents, even as they stand, would benefit from the provision of subject and other indexes. The Government sees a need to review these documents in a quite fundamental way to ensure that they meet the current information needs of Parliament and the public, and that they facilitate accountability by the Commonwealth administration. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all very beautiful words, but I want to explain what I think about program budgeting. The Department of Finance released Program Budgeting Specification and Guidelines in October 1985 to prescribe guidelines for the implementation and objectives of program budgeting. The specification and guidelines reinforced enhancement of budgetary documentation. I quote from that document:</PARA>
<PARA>By focusing budgetary processes more clearly on the purposes of government programs and emphasising the efficiency and effectiveness of their implementation, delivery and administration, the Government considers that program budgeting will assist its own budget decision making, assist parliamentary and public scrutiny and encourage more effective program management by Commonwealth agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I move now to the report of Estimates Committee A of October 1984, which recommended that changes to the Budget documents should be examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I do not need to state the terms of reference of that Committee, but it was envisaged that program and subprogram statements would accompany the appropriations. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The planned provision of program statements in the Budget Documents would be as additional information without any loss of detail provided in the present budget documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Program statements would include both narrative and financial information. Each program statement would provide:</PARA>
<PARA> a description of the program element;</PARA>
<PARA> its objective(s);</PARA>
<PARA> relevant financial information;</PARA>
<PARA> performance indicators-</PARA>
<PARA>which the Committee recognised would take some time to develop. Some examples of the presentation of program statements, including explanations of estimates for individual program elements, were provided. The Committee said that statements of program objectives and performance indicators would enable evaluation, and so on. However, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations emphasised the evolutionary and consultative process. It knew that some departments should have to trial this program budgeting. However, the Committee's second report contained the reports of Estimates Committees A and C. It recommended the refinement of Budget documents to eliminate discrepancies, but added:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee does not believe it can comment further on these issues until program budgeting became more widely established, and especially until the pilot departments have had a second year of experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Then we come to this year. The 1988-89 appropriations examined by Estimates Committee F were those for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Social Security. The Committee emphasised unclear definitions of program objectives used for evaluating the efficiency of programs. In addition, it identified inadequacies in the presentation of program statements and explanatory notes. These inadequacies cover documentation, accomplishment of objectives, meaningful program objectives, execution and evaluation of programs, and selection of performance indicators. The report of Estimates Committee B for this year stated that its explanatory notes disclosed similar inadequacies, and it emphasised the requirement for the departments to improve their documentation, ensure that performance indicators are adequately developed, and assess the effects of external programs on departmental programs. The Committee emphasised the following point:</PARA>
<PARA>The larger issue, however, is the extent to which the presentation of explanatory material in program format assists the Senate and its Committees to scrutinise expenditure effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on. What I am saying is that, on the evidence before us, program budgeting is not a good way to go about assessing the Estimates of the Government. This system has been used in the United States, and I think we gained experience from that. But it has been ditched in the United States, and I hope that at some time in the future we will ditch it here in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Appropriation Bills, and this gives me the opportunity to bring the people's attention to the serious matter of taxpayers' money being spent illegally by a Government department, the Treasury. This is being done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in conducting an illegal compulsory household expenditure survey. This matter was first brought to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last July, when the survey was first implemented, by Mr Don Cameron, the member for Moreton. At that time Mr Cameron pointed out to the Treasurer that the household expenditure survey being undertaken by the Bureau of Statistics was a new survey and a compulsory survey, and that therefore its implementation was illegal. The only way the Bureau can conduct such a survey is to have it tabled before both Houses of Parliament before its implementation. Otherwise it must be a voluntary survey, not a compulsory one. This was not done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the Australian Statistician, Mr Castles, the reason for that survey's not being tabled was that it was not a new survey. He said that it was `virtually the same as the previous surveys in 1974-75 and 1975-76'. As Mr Cameron and I both pointed out on many occasions, the household expenditure survey is indeed a new survey. It is totally different from the surveys conducted previously. There are twice as many questions in this survey; they are far more intrusive than the questions in previous surveys. The format is different; so too is the methodology. Apart from anything else, the previous surveys were voluntary; this survey is compulsory. So how can the surveys possibly be virtually the same, as Mr Castles maintains?</PARA>
<PARA> I was so convinced that the survey was a new survey that I asked the Clerk of the Senate to give me a legal opinion. The Clerk's opinion was unequivocal. The survey was, in his opinion, a new survey and, because it was not tabled, it was being conducted illegally as a compulsory survey. The Clerk suggested that I get another opinion, so I asked him to get me one. Professor Whalan, Professor of Law at the Australian National University, was asked for his opinion. He gives legal opinions to the Senate. He gave me a similar opinion. As a result of these two legal opinions, the Bureau of Statistics panicked. Mr Castles, the chief Statistician, no doubt realising that he was now conducting an illegal survey, requested a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Attorney-General's Department can give its client an opinion only as a result of the information with which it is supplied. I would like to quote from the final paragraph of the Bureau's letter to the Attorney-General's Department. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The content of all four of the ABS household expenditure surveys has been virtually identical. The form in which the information has been sought has also remained unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA>I will leave out a bit of padding. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The only significant difference in coverage has been that the 1974-75 survey, unlike the succeeding three surveys, was restricted to capital cities and-</PARA>
<PARA>this is important-</PARA>
<PARA>the only significant change in statistical methodology has been that in the case of rural households the period during which the personal diaries must be kept was reduced from four weeks in the 1975-76 and 1984 surveys to two weeks in the 1988-89 survey. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General did not ask for any further information. He did not ask to see the questions from both surveys so that he could compare them. I would like to quote from the Attorney-General's opinion, because I think that the way the Attorney-General's Department worded it is vital. The Attorney says to the Bureau of Statistics:</PARA>
<PARA> You state that the content of all four of the Household Expenditure Surveys has been virtually identical; also that the format in which the information has been sought has also remained unchanged. In this respect you have stated that for each Survey there is a `personal diary' for each member of the household, an `expenditure questionnaire' and an `income questionnaire' . . . You advise that the only significant change in statistical methodology has been that, in the case of rural households, the period during which the `personal diary' must be kept was reduced from four weeks in 1975-76 and 1988 Surveys to two weeks in the 1988-89 Survey . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Questions of fact and degree can arise in determining whether a course of action is different in these respects to be a new proposal within the meaning of subsection 6 (3). However on the basis of the advice you have provided, it appears that the 1988-89 Survey does not differ to any significant extent from its predecessors. It that is so, in my opinion the proposal in respect of the 1988-89 Survey did not answer the description of a `new' proposal within the meaning of subsection 6 (3) . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, if the 1988-89 Survey is of the nature you described, tabling under subsection 3 of the ABS Act was not required prior to implementation of that Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that very interesting. The Attorney-General's Department was not accepting any responsibility at all for the accuracy of the information that had been supplied to it. The Attorney was qualifying his legal opinion repeatedly by saying `if the information you gave me is accurate'. By this time Mr Cameron had approached the Ombudsman, who had indicated that the legality of the survey should be established before a court of law. Panic really set in, and Mr Castles again sought advice from the Attorney-General, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Ombudsman also advised Mr Cameron that:</PARA>
<PARA> If a definitive answer is necessary, then it would seem necessary for the matter to be tested in court, whether by way of application for a declaration or, perhaps, an injunction, or by defence to prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, none of these possible courses of action would be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators can bet they would not-not to him. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to minimise the possibility of legal proceedings--</PARA>
<PARA>he is pointing out that legal proceedings would be the last thing the Bureau wanted-</PARA>
<PARA>and, depending on the outcome, the risk of disruption to the activities of the ABS, I believe that the preferable course would be to table proposals for the continuation of all collections of information for statistical purposes which are currently being implemented by the Bureau and which have not been, or may not have been, the subject of a relevant tabled proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Castles got the advice from the Attorney-General and belatedly decided to table the survey, halfway through its implementation. Believing that this could well have been the action the Bureau may have tried to get away with, I had taken the precaution some months before of asking the Clerk of the Senate and Professor Whalan whether, if the Bureau did try to pull this one, retrospective tabling would be legal. They both said, `Definitely not'. I do not blame them. The legislation says very clearly that, subject to subsection 4, each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the Bureau shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament before its implementation unless the proposal is for the collection of information on a voluntary basis. We know that this survey was on a compulsory basis. I quote part of a paragraph from the advice given to me by the Clerk of the Senate. Referring to the view taken by the Attorney-General and the ABS, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a view of the law, which does violence to the intention of Parliament and the rights of individuals, is, in my view, entirely unacceptable, and a court should not countenance it. It is time the requirements of the law took precedence to the requirements of policy, convenience and expediency in this matter . . . in so far as the ABS always intended to conduct the current survey as a compulsory one but did not table the proposal prior to its implementation, it may be argued that all the expenditure of money, and the work done, on the implementation of that proposal has been without lawful authority under the ABS Act. </PARA>
<PARA>They are rather serious accusations, and something that the Government repeatedly has refused to acknowledge. During the Estimates committee hearings I questioned the Bureau regarding the legality of the survey as well as about the information it gave the Attorney-General's Department when asking for its legal opinion. During the questioning, Mr Skinner of the Bureau made it very clear that the Bureau `had no plans to prosecute' the many people who had already refused to respond to the survey prior to the tabling. In other words, the Bureau well knew that the survey was illegal but was still prepared to use the information already collected illegally. The original advice to Mr Castles from his Department was that he should table the survey. I quote from a minute paper I received through freedom of information. Mr Giles, the Assistant Statistician, Social Welfare Branch, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Household Expenditure Survey is the most burdensome household survey undertaken by the ABS and is also considered to be highly intrusive by some members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore seek your approval to table the 1988-89 Household Expenditure Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a notation from Mr Sims, `No, for reasons we discussed'. The officers of the Bureau well knew that things had got into a real shambles. They well knew that their interviewers had been falsely telling people they would be fined $100 a day if they refused to participate in the survey. They well knew that, while they had received a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department, the opinion was not worth a bumper because of the lack of information and the misleading information they had supplied to that Department. During questioning Mr Skinner was forced to acknowledge that he had not given correct information to the Attorney-General's Department when he said that the only significant change in methodology had been that the rural household diaries had changed from a four-week period to a two-week period. I pointed out that the earlier surveys were voluntary and that this one was compulsory. I said, `Would not that be a significant change in methodology?', to which he finally replied, `It certainly is significant. Yes . . .'. Yet the Attorney-General's Department had been told there was only one significant change in methodology and it had not been told about the significance of the change from voluntary to compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Skinner also acknowledged that he had not sent the Attorney-General's Department copies of all the questions from the various surveys for comparison. Again, while Mr Castles had told the Attorney-General's Department that the format had remained unchanged,. there was an additional form in the survey which was required to be signed by those chosen for the survey, called the `Loan Authorisation Form', which when signed gave permission to those people's banks or lending societies to give the ABS all their private financial information. The Attorney-Generals' Department was not told about this intrusive form. It was completely unaware that such a form existed. This is the sort information that the Attorney-General's Department was given when it was asked to form a legal opinion as to whether the two surveys were virtually the same. It was on this sort of advice that the ABS sent out letters saying, `Now that we have tabled the household expenditure survey, we have removed any doubt about its legality' and telling the people who had refused to participate, `I hope you will now cooperate'. </PARA>
<PARA> As a layman, I am appalled that the Australian people can be hoodwinked by a government authority which is willing to rely for its legality in carrying out its functions on an opinion from the Attorney-General's Department, given on false and misleading information, and I am appalled that the Attorney-General's Department was willing to accept insufficient information, and did not request the further information it knew was required, to make an illegal opinion credible. How can the people of Australia have any confidence in the Attorney-General's Department under these circumstances? How can we rely on the letters written on Mr Castles's behalf to so many people pointing out that they now had to complete those surveys? During the Estimates hearings the Bureau acknowledged that the letter sent out to those people should never have been written. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate an indication of the differences in the two surveys. I have pointed out the difference in methodology; that one was voluntary and one was compulsory. I have pointed out the difference in format; that a very intrusive form had to be signed although it did not have to be signed on a previous occasion. So let me give a very brief description of some of the differences in the questions. There were 61 additional areas of questioning in the 1988-89 survey in comparison with the 1974-75 survey. There were some 106 questions in the 1974-75 expenditure questionnaire compared with 216 questions in the expenditure questionnaire for 1988. The maximum number of feasible responses for the expenditure questionnaire rose from 577 in 1974-75 to 1,076 in 1988-89. Let me explain just how intrusive some of those questions were. People were asked: `Have you taken out any loans? What was the net amount? What was the purpose of the loan? What was your security? What were the terms of the loan?'. The questionnaire then went on to health, with such questions as: `In the last three months have you made any payments to a general practitioner or a family doctor? If so, for what sort of service?'. In other words, it asked, `Give us your full health history'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the number. it also asked, `What would the sale price of your house or flat be at the moment?'. There were so many questions. We come to one that asked of those who had taken out a loan on a house, `What was the purpose of the loan? What was the loan's security? What was your first mortgage or your second mortgage? Is it unsecured?'. It went on, `What sort of work do you do? Have you a second job? In your second job do you work for an employer, for wages or salary? Are you in your own business? Have you records for the financial year of July 1986-87? Please produce the previous financial year's records, the tax assessments and group certificates. How much tax was payable on your income for this period? What was the amount of the tax deduction for your earnings for this period?'. The Bureau is not the Australian Taxation Office. People were asked: `Did you receive a tax refund?. Did you pay or do you expect to pay any extra tax?.' So the questions went on-the most intrusive questions that could possibly be asked.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is without a doubt the most intrusive questioning that any survey has ever undertaken, yet the Bureau says it is virtually the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following my questioning of the ABS and the Attorney-General's Department, the Ombudsman became very concerned and wrote to Mr Cameron and me expressing his worries. He has a few initial concerns, and I will just read the following from his letter:</PARA>
<PARA> The matters dealt with in my letter of 21 September 1988 and still outstanding are:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the original 1988 HES-</PARA>
<PARA>household expenditure survey-</PARA>
<PARA>should have been tabled before implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether some interviewers and ABS officers should be counselled against overzealous or officious assertion that the original 1988 HES was compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he said that there were, however, many new issues. He said that, having read the questioning in the Estimates Committee, he was now asking the Bureau of Statistics to give information on whether the Attorney-General's Department was given misleading or insufficient instruction when its opinion of the need for the tabling of the original 1988 household expenditure survey was being sought. He is asking whether the Attorney-General's Department was given sufficient and misleading information. He is also asking whether the ABS assertion that the original 1988 expenditure survey was not new, being `virtually identical' to earlier surveys, was misleading; whether the ABS assertion that the Attorney-General's Department's advice justified the original 1988 household expenditure survey was misleading; whether the ABS is correctly advising the public as to the operation of section 11 of the Census and Statistics Act; and whether the ABS assertion that the tabling of the tabled 1988 household expenditure survey makes the original 1988 household expenditure survey compulsory is misleading. He asks about the confidentiality of the survey data and the advice that his office should be giving to inquiries from members of the public concerned about their obligations to take part. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman tells me that he sought comments on the above matters from the Australian Statistician and that he will prepare his report in light of the response. He is presently waiting for a response from the ABS prior to putting down his report. That information, although asked for on 3 November, has not been forwarded. In reference to the Attorney-General's opinion, I quote from the Ombudsman's letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Walters,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to our telephone conversation on 7 November 1988 regarding whether the proposal tabled on 29 September 1988 for an Household Expenditure Survey to commence on 1 October 1988 . . . can be implemented as a compulsory survey given that preparatory work commenced prior to tabling. You provided me with copies of opinions by Mr P. O'Keefe and Professor D. Whalan on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I am raising these issues with the Australian Statistician and suggesting that he obtain the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>We have not yet heard the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department on that matter. We have not yet heard the explanation that the Ombudsman requires from the Bureau of Statistics. I have asked the Government to stop any further interviews on its survey until the Ombudsman's report has been brought down. I have been totally ignored by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I would just like to read once again part of the opinion I received from the Clerk of the Senate when he was referring to the argument by the ABS and the Attorney-General's Department that retrospective tabling of the survey by the ABS made that survey illegal. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Such a view of the law, which does violence to the intention of Parliament and the rights of individuals, is, in my view, entirely unacceptable, and a court could not countenance it. It is time the requirements of the law took precedence to the requirements of policy, convenience and expediency in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Walsh wants to join in this debate, he can put his name on the list. In 1973 the Australian Statistician of the day wrote to his Labor Treasurer seeking approval to conduct a household expenditure survey. He referred to the voluntary or compulsory nature of that survey and I would just like to quote him. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(iii) replies to the survey proper would be on a voluntary basis. This would be a departure from normal practice where it is regarded as essential that virtually all respondents selected in a sample survey should supply replies. However, in this survey the questions asked are of necessity intrusive e.g. details of income) and also the task of completing diaries may be regarded as onerous by the householders. I believe it is widely accepted that the quality of information supplied by householders in answer to these questions is better if supplied voluntarily than if compulsion is used. Other countries accept a response rate in these surveys of between 65%-75% as giving valuable results. My experience in the pilot tests conducted during the feasibility study was that a voluntary collection gave a response rate within this range. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1973 and the way in which the Bureau has moved from voluntary household expenditure surveys in 1974-75 and 1975-76 to compulsory surveys in 1984 and 1988-89 is unclear. Answering questions in Estimates Committee C on 11 October on the very issue of the 1988-89 survey, Mr Skinner said:</PARA>
<PARA>On this occasion we believe we have got the authority to conduct this on a compulsory basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where he thought he got the authority but he thought he had it. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I would put it to Madam Chair that we are conducting this survey essentially in the same way that we conducted previous surveys in so far as we are seeking the willing cooperation of householders and in that we are using section 11 (1) of the Census and Statistics Act, which provides that the Bureau or the Statistician can ask questions. People who fail to answer those questions do not commit an offence; no penalty is incurred. The difference between the surveys, the 1988-89 survey and the previous two in the mid-1970s, is that if our interviewers are pressed-and I stress the word `pressed'-as to whether the survey is compulsory, in 1974-75 and 1975-76 the answer was no, and in 1988-89 and indeed in 1984 the answer was yes. However, the Bureau did not proceed in 1984, as I have mentioned, to prosecute anybody. </PARA>
<PARA>This claim by Mr Skinner does not sit well with two letters to the editor in the Australian dated 28 September 1988. The first one is from a constituent of mine in Box Hill, Victoria, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>When I objected that the questions were too personal and the information was none of the Government's business, the lady from the bureau told me that I had to answer her questions or I would be fined and she showed me a copy of the Statistics Act to prove her point. </PARA>
<PARA>There was another letter from somebody in Sydney whose name was supplied but who did not want his or her name to be disclosed. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>I didn't know I could refuse, so when they told me that I had to participate or be fined I just got angry and made up all the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> Please don't, under any circumstances, publish my name or Big Brother will have me in court for not telling him the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>That person's name was supplied to the Australian but not revealed. One of my constituents, who has been named in the other place and who was very concerned at the way she was dealt with, said that she was not prepared to answer the questionnaire. I have spent quite a lot of time speaking to her on the telephone. She was so moved that she went back and read Mill on freedom and liberty to really make sure that the stand she was taking was an appropriate stand. She decided that under no circumstances, even if it meant going to gaol, was she going to answer this intrusive questionnaire. I do not know what Mr Skinner was talking about but obviously some of the people who were confronted by the Bureau had a quite different opinion from what Mr Skinner seemed to believe was the situation. Apparently the Bureau became concerned about the attention being drawn to issues of privacy in regard to compulsory surveys. As I mentioned, when the 1986-87 report was tabled in this House almost no mention was made of this issue. A whole chapter, 13 pages in fact, was devoted to statistics and privacy in the 1987-88 report. The Bureau must have had a difficult time putting up a case for compulsory surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the help of the Parliamentary Library-which provides a service acknowledged too little in this place-a search of the psychological, sociological, and market research literature drew a blank. None of the articles provided, dating back to 1937, lent support to the Bureau's argument. There were a number of articles on signed versus unsigned questionnaires, on surveys where people were asked to put their names and where people were not asked to put their names, and on the lack of surveillance. But there were no studies on compulsory versus voluntary surveys. The Bureau must have been clutching at straws when it relied on a report by the West German Government to support its argument. The Bureau devotes almost two pages of its 13 page argument to this support. The ABS summarised it as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It cannot, of course, be assumed that the findings of this investigation in the Federal Republic of Germany would apply in their totality in Australian circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a nice little qualification. The summary continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The results must, however, be regarded as significant-particularly when account is taken of the thoroughness of the study, the unambiguous nature of the technical conclusions and the strong support of the Government for the maintenance of compulsion in a country in which there are strong concerns for individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>If that had been a second-year university student presenting a summary of a report of the nature of the one from the West German Government, in my book that student would have failed. The Bureau may have summarised the report thus; however, I took the trouble to get a copy of the report. If one can work one's way through the obscure English translation one can only surmise that either the study was inadequate and/or that the report of the study was inadequate. Despite what the ABS would have us believe, the study only tells us about the response rates of compulsory as compared with voluntary micro-census surveys-quantitative data, not qualitative data. It does not examine the accuracy or the truthfulness of responses. It is a possibility that a percentage of those who respond in the compulsory surveys tell lies. This may distort the findings just as much as a failure to respond would do. I seek leave to table the West German report which I obtained through the Library, entitled, Experiences Resulting from the Implementation of the Microcensus Act. This report by the West German Government, dated 10 June 1985, was submitted in Bonn in January 1988. </PARA>

<PARA> Spot checks comparable to the microcensus-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the micro-census which this report is studying-</PARA>
<PARA>are being carried out under obligation to give information on principle in 12 countries in the OECD realm-including the Federal Republic of Germany. Nine countries are practising voluntary giving of information. </PARA>
<PARA> Voluntary labour force spot checks in these countries, which-like the microcensus-are to supply safe absolute figures and rates of change up to the previous report period, achieve answer proportions lying between 81% and 95%. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about voluntary questionnaires. Other countries are getting response rates of 81 per cent and 95 per cent. The ABS failed even to mention that in its report. It talks only of the West German Government because it supports its argument. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> The distinctly higher proportions are above all obtained because the people questioned consider giving information at State surveys in the States under consideration as their duty as citizens on principle. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that if the ABS took the time to inform citizens about the importance of such a survey we might find that the Australian citizenry would also be inclined to respond. If this is the only evidence that the ABS can muster to support the need for a compulsory household expenditure survey it should go back to the drawing board. This issue of privacy and individual rights is so important that maybe the Australian Government should fund an independent study rather than rely on an inadequate report of a single study-I stress the word `single'-which it admits may not be applicable to Australia. No university department would be allowed by an ethics committee to carry out a compulsory survey with such fragile information and a study based on such poor methodology.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator will have her opportunity. I hope that she has gone into as much detail. Both the ABS report and Senator Collins in his speech quoted Mr Howard's reply to the second reading debate on the Census Statistics Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. The ABS on pages 11 and 12 of its report committed the sin of selectively quoting Mr Howard. Senator Collins seems to have relied on the ABS report rather than reading the whole of Mr Howard's speech. For the record, I would like to set this matter straight. Senator Collins, as did the ABS, quoted a quite substantial amount of that speech and then went on to quote the third paragraph, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have tried to do is to balance those two aspirations as much as we possibly can. Of course we need information. Of course governments have to ask questions, whatever political persuasion they are. Of course we need sound statistical data on which to base our decisions in whatever area those decisions are. But equally there is a growing and legitimate community resentment towards over-intrusive government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where Senator Collins and the ABS chose to stop, but for the record I wish to go on with the speech:</PARA>
<PARA>A growing number of people ask `why' when governments ask them questions. I think that is a healthy trend. I think it is a trend that we ought to encourage. It is a trend which indicates a healthy scepticism towards an automatic acceptance that just because the Government wants something it happens to be correct. I think we will find, as a thread running through all the decisions that the Government has made in this area, an attempt by the Government over the last five years to strike a balance between those two conflicting principles. </PARA>
<PARA>There is quite a different picture when we read the whole paragraph. I would like to leave aside now the question of the intrusion of the privacy of individuals and households and address the stand of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and its senior officers and condemn it for the contemptuous way in which it has treated this Parliament. The burden of legal opinion is, quite clearly, that the 1988-89 household expenditure survey is, under almost any definition, new. The only opinion to the contrary is that of the Department of the Attorney-General. On the evidence presented to the relevant Estimates Committees that Department quite clearly was misled by the ABS when an opinion was sought. The facts were simply not given to the Attorney-General's Department which, in turn, did not bother to check up on what the ABS had said despite the publicity surrounding the legal validity of the compulsory nature of the survey. To return to the ABS, Assistant Statistician Giles on 10 March 1988 sent a minute to the Deputy Statistician, Mr McLennan, a section of which states:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there are some compelling reasons for tabling the 1988/89 household expenditure survey. </PARA>
<PARA> The household expenditure survey is the most burdensome household survey undertaken by the ABS and is also considered to be highly intrusive by some members of the community. As a consequence, the survey tends to generate ministerials arising from complaints by constituents to their local members of parliament. Being able to say that the survey had been tabled and subject to parliamentary scrutiny it then becomes a very useful ABS tactic. I therefore seek your approval to table the 1988/89 household expenditure survey. </PARA>
<PARA>To this a handwritten annotation was made by Mr G. Sims, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr. McLennan</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edwards</PARA>
<PARA> Our policy outlined in the ABS Parliamentary Liaison Procedures Manual, suggests that tabling is unnecessary in this case (see extract attached). However, I would accept Mr Giles' arguments as consistent with the purposes of the tabling proposals-HES has a greater impact than other household surveys on reporting load and raises more questions about ABS ``intrusion''. I recommend tabling. </PARA>
<PARA>G. Sims</PARA>
<PARA>14.3.88</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding that these officers have, I believe, wrongly interpreted the policy on tabling, the comments of Assistant Statistician Giles show an attitude to this Parliament and its members which is, to say the least, arrogant. The response of the Statistician to this recommendation for tabling was, `Mr. Sims, no, for reasons we discussed'. It does not take much imagination to divine those reasons: the growing concern about activities of the ABS and the very complaints mentioned and made by members of parliament during the 1984 survey. From June onwards the legal opinions began to flow in, one after the other. Among them were two which I had requested through the Clerk of the Senate, confirming the view that the HES was indeed `new' and therefore, to be compulsory, must be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Did the ABS admit that it had been wrong? No. It indulged itself in an orgy of criticism of members and servants of this Parliament who had been properly discharging their duty. Then late in the day, on Thursday, 29 September, the ABS hurried into the Parliament a collection of proposals numbered 13 to 57, of which No. 50 was the HES. And here we have the contemptuous act. This so-called `new' proposal was to commence a mere two days later, on 1 October. It was not a new proposal at all, just the old proposal dressed up in new clothes. What do the ABS's own guidelines tell us about tabling proposals? The guidelines state:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals to collect statistical information from households or individuals can not be tabled retrospectively. For this reason, and because of the emergency nature of the provision for retrospective tabling, it should be assumed that all proposals, must be tabled while the Parliament is in session, and before the collection commences. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no set deadline, before the commencement of a collection, by which a proposal must be tabled. However, it is desirable to table four sitting weeks before the intended commencement date for the collection. To allow for internal ABS clearance, advice to the Minister, and arrangements for physically tabling in the Parliament, draft documentation should be handed to the Secretariat not less than seven weeks before the commencement date planned for the new statistical collection. It is the responsibility of subject matter areas to ensure that this is done. </PARA>
<PARA> The lead-time should be regarded as a minimum because proposals can be tabled only when Parliament is sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>As this was the same old survey-not compulsory-it became not one whit more compulsory after 1 October than it had been before. One has to wonder at the justification the Statistician gave for this belated decision to table any proposal at all, let alone 45 of them. He was `bearing in mind the desirability of exercising an ``abundance of caution'' '. Why did the Statistician not exercise this abundance of caution months ago? Despite all the disclaimers of the tabling document for these 45 proposals, the whole of the action of the Statistician is directed at undoing the damage done in his note of 16 March, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sims, no, for reasons we discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>And what was the reason? Essentially it was the lack of compelling evidence of the need for a compulsory survey. I digress here to comment on a statement made by Senator Collins last Thursday when he was debating Senator Sheil's Census and Statistics Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 provides that each new proposal for the collection of information has to be laid before both Houses of Parliament before its implementation-which is also subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA>All the advice I have sought says that this is not the case. Yes, new proposals must be tabled, but they are not subject to disallowance. Senator Collins, in response to an interjection I made during his speech, said that he hoped I would have treated the debate more seriously. My reply to Senator Collins, if he were here, would be that I hoped that he would have treated the debate more seriously and got his facts right. The fact is that this Parliament cannot disallow a compulsory survey even if it is tabled. I would have hoped that, given the importance of this issue for the rights and privacy of individuals and the sensitivity of the issue, the Statistician, rather than haggling over whether this proposal should have been tabled or should not have been tabled, would have followed the advice of his own junior officers to table the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The contempt in which the Statistician has held this Parliament is sufficient evidence for this Parliament to take immediate steps: first, to review the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act to ensure that any surveys that are to be carried out compulsorily are justifiable; and, second, that mechanisms should be put in place through legislation, because of the sensitivity and the possibility of infringing rights of individuals, to allow appropriate scrutiny by this Parliament of proposals for surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken the opportunity afforded by the amendment in relation to the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to explain why I wholeheartedly support the motion that the Senate condemn the Government for coercing participation in the ABS household expenditure survey in the face of substantial doubt about its validity and legal basis. </PARA>

The Budget indicates that this year it is expected that something like $1,294,590,000 will be spent in the Department of Community Services and Health. It is only a portion of that that I wish to refer to this evening. With this expenditure the Government states that it proposes to ensure that Australians have access to necessary health services and to provide for health research and promotion, amongst other things. It is specifically the health research that I want to refer to. There are many other aspects that I could and would like to talk about, but I believe that this is an important matter that ought to be considered by the Senate. I suggest that the Government's actions deny that health research has any real significance within its program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last month I asked the Minister who represents the Minister for Community Services and Health in this chamber a question concerning the Government's commitment to maintaining the vital scientific functions of the Health Research and Services Division of the Department and in particular the Nutrition Unit of that Division. I asked whether the Minister was aware of the important scientific research that the Unit conducts, including the compilation of information about nutrition, and asked whether he could guarantee that there would be no reduction in the scientific functions of the Unit, which has been transferred to the Health Advancement Division of the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook's immediate reply indicated that he did not know what the Government's long term commitment was to the scientific functions of the Unit, but he later gave an additional answer and informed the Senate that the Government's decision to transfer the unit to Health Advancement was merely in order to produce greater efficiency. My goodness, how often do we hear the word `efficiency' used these days and how often is that word abused? He indicated that this would not lead to any reduction in scientific positions, but that really does not seem to be the case. One could perhaps take some comfort from the Minister's assurances if it were not for the fact that his Government has already begun to cut scientific staff working in the area of nutrition in the Department of Community Services and Health. It would seem that the transfer is to take place on 1 December, that is, Thursday of this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a letter written earlier this year by the Dietitians Association of Australia to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), expressing its concern about what it thought would be happening. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Following the report of the Better Health Commission, the Department withdrew the services of two nutrition consultants, members of DAA, who were assisting Departmental nutritionists with the revision of Tables of Composition of Australian Foods . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These tables of composition of Australian foods are extremely valuable sources of information. The sources of Australian food have been analysed and divided by composition, and the tables are a valuable resource for many people. I will refer later to the sort of people who use them. The dietitians went on in their letter of 27 July to the Minister to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This has resulted in a major delay to this program, essential to nearly all nutrition activities in this country. This project will now be further delayed and threatened by the Department's decision to reduce staff resources in the nutrition area. Other projects to be affected include the reporting of national dietary surveys, including the report on the nutrient intakes from the Dietary Survey of Australian School Children. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Members of DAA, and indeed all personnel working in the area of nutrition, require up-to-date information on the nutrient content of foods and on food consumption patterns to effectively perform their education, counselling and research activities. The decision by your Department to withdraw resources on two occasions from nutrition activities is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Better Health Commission in which nutrition was identified as one of the three major priority areas for the health of Australians. It was only in April 1988 that, on behalf of the Australian State Health Ministers, you-</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister for Health-</PARA>
<PARA>announced nutrition as one of the five priority areas for action to achieve `Health for All by the Year 2000'. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the balance of that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>There is obvious inconsistency between the expressed priorities of all Australian Health Ministers and your apparent support of this view, and the decisions being made in your Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the DAA depend on the national nutrition references and data bases developed within your Department to perform their daily work activities. Such references as the Recommended Dietary Intakes, the Tables of Composition of Australian Foods, the annual series Apparent Consumption of Foodstuffs and Nutrients Australia, Weight-Height charts, nutrient and food consumption data from national surveys, dietary guidelines and nutrition policy in general, are essential tools and resources for all working in the field of nutrition. Decisions being made in your Department are seriously limiting the availability and updating of the above references and data bases. While the bill for curative health care continues to climb, cuts are made to achieve relatively little saving in an area identified as one of the most effective means of improving health. </PARA>
<PARA>Announcement of these reductions was particularly incongruous, occurring in Diabetes Week. Diabetes is a major threat to health, and great importance is placed on dietary measures combined with exercise as preventive treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>As stated in the Canberra Times (17/7/88),</PARA>
<PARA> ``a national health policy that promotes nutrition education plus awareness and avoidance of the hazards of overweight and inactivity is likely to alleviate the frequency and severity of non-insulin dependant diabetes in Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA>This same statement applies to the other major degenerative diseases, affecting morbidity and mortality in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>The DAA believes your Department should demonstrate a commitment to improved nutrition for Australians, by increasing not reducing, support for nutrition activities essential for the effective policy and program development needed to achieve health for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA>The Dietitians Association of Australia was dismayed to learn that the names of 9 of the 10 staff from the Nutrition Section have been forwarded to the respective unions for possible retrenchment. </PARA>
<PARA>This is even more surprising when in the Senate on 17 October 1988, Senator Cook in responding to a question from Senator Margaret Reid stated that ``the scientific positions will be retained''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Department of Community Services &amp; Health is not reducing its priority for nutrition services. The nutrition services program is managed by the Health Advancement Division of the Department. Nutrition is one of the five priority areas nominated in the national better health program. It is therefore sensible to amalgamate the work of the nutrition section with better health planning and nutrition within that division. There will be some efficiencies resulting from the amalgamation, primarily in the area of general clerical support; however, the scientific positions will be retained.''</PARA>
<PARA>It is my understanding, from discussions with the unions that if retrenchment is to be made to scientific or support staff that all names of people filling those positions must be forwarded to the union.

<PARA> We met with the unions on Wednesday 2 November to discuss the proposals, many of which will result in staff becoming excess to requirements in the affected areas. The unions argued strongly that we should not advise officers in those areas nor provide details of the officers concerned to the unions. Quite apart from the fact that I am required by the Award to provide this information to unions and to staff, I believe that all staff have a right to know what is proposed and how it might affect them personally. </PARA>

<PARA> I must stress that although your details have been provided to the unions, this does not mean that you will be retrenched against your wishes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This action is all the more incredible when one considers that the Better Health Commission report states that improving nutrition of individuals is the single most effective means of improving the health of the community. I would have thought that the Government's approach to health would be towards improving generally the health of the community-prevention rather than the expensive cures. The Government has attempted to cut back on the range of pharmaceuticals available. It is obviously attempting to rein in costs, but surely the first priority should be the better health of the community. Of course, to achieve that we need the research that gives the information which will lead to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government now is making a great deal of its new health for all program, the spending of $20m on health which will have a major focus on nutrition and health conditions-health and food nutrition relationships with things such as hypertension, cancer and other conditions. I wonder how many glossy brochures will appear under the heading `Health for all Australians', what opportunities there will be for photographs of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others in publicising the program. The Priority One program springs to mind. It was to provide jobs. It provided lots of glossy brochures; not a lot of jobs. I hope we are not having a repeat of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of providing the additional resources one would expect to strengthen scientific activities which are the basis of such a program, the staff positions are being cut and the scientific program is being moved into another, non-scientific area. There is justified concern that no other agency, government or private, has the responsibility or necessary expertise to provide the scientific research for major aspects of the better health program. One is therefore entitled to question how cost-effective the expenditure of $20m plus the matched amounts from the States can be if the scientific work is cut. One once again asks whether science is the victim with this program. </PARA>
<PARA> Questionable indeed is the placement of long-established activities in the Department into a short term program area with the consequent staff reductions that I have referred to. Nutrition and its scientific basis are being put into a non-scientific area. I suggest it is jeopardising the 50-year history of scientific public health nutrition activity for the sake of this short term program. I am not referring so much to the job losses but to the loss of the scientific functions. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of functions am I referring to? Work on the composition of foods that I have mentioned, the nutritional intake of Australians and fatty acids in the Australian diet is just an example. The significant work that this group has done is absolutely fundamental to the National Health and Medical Research Council. I believe that national repercussions will flow to the assessment of scientific and public health information. It will mean that legislative, industrial, professional users of the information and the references which have been developed will be deprived of access to a body of information and expertise held nowhere else in Australia. It probably will not even be able to be maintained on a proper basis. As I said, there is no other government agency or body responsible for or established for these activities. Consumer protection aspects of food safety could be lost. Who will check the nutritional adequacy of the Australian diet? Who would protect against spurious health claims? The Government's decision to give the unit the additional functions to service the health for all programs with fewer resources is, I suggest, short-sighted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, though, another aspect of cutbacks in the scientific area that I want to refer to while I have the opportunity tonight: nutrition is not the only area that is suffering. I recently received a letter concerning the curtailment of services to the National Poisons Information Service, which is important to this country. The National Poisons Register, which provides a service directly affecting community health, is mentioned as another area where no work will be done as a result of staff cuts. I refer to a letter to me from the Pharmacist-in-Charge of the Australian Capital Territory Poisons Information Service at the Royal Canberra Hospital in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA>This register contains data on products of all types provided to the Department by manufacturers, agents and importers. The data is evaluated for its toxicological significance by an appropriately trained departmental scientist. The material, plus management material is then distributed, on microfiche, regularly, to all state poisons services and some hundreds of designated hospitals, and is used as a basis for arriving at appropriate poisons management for the public, by doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other health professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate poisons managements starts with knowledge of what is in the substance to which the patient has been exposed. Only then can the correct treatment be instituted. Speed of identification is vital. This generally means minutes, rather than hours or days. </PARA>
<PARA> When information is not available quickly enough, the patient must then be treated and/or observed at a medical facility . . . as for exposure to an unknown poison, then the most appropriate care may be readily available at home. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides being a very costly procedure, unnecessary trauma to these patients may result. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At any time, when a member of the public rings a poisons service following exposure, immediate advice can be given using the resources of the National Poisons Register . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems incredible that the Government could even contemplate cutbacks such as would threaten the future of the important work of the Poisons Information Service. Yet it has been identified as one of the areas targeted by the Government for expenditure cuts. There are others, such as in the area of environmental health. For example, there have been suggestions that the Department's environmental health section, which supports committees monitoring and regulating the nation's air and water quality, will be abolished. So the reality of what is happening to the funding of the scientific functions within the Department of Community Services and Health belies the Minister's claims to me when he answered my questions directed specifically to the matter of nutrition, to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Government should look beyond the short term expedient of its glossy brochures. It should consider the long term obligation to preserve the expertise which has been built up within these areas of the Department in which significant scientific research has been undertaken. It should build on that expertise, not cut it out. I hope that the Government will reconsider what I regard as its misplaced priorities and ensure that adequate funding will allow the scientific functions to which I have referred to continue to be carried out effectively. It should not merely use this word `efficiency' to cover up cutbacks of the kind that I have dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine my remarks in the debate on the Appropriation Bills to a few specific areas that, hopefully, have not yet been covered by all speakers. Before turning to the specific areas that I wish to consider, it is perhaps time once again to reflect in what direction Australia is heading. Despite assertions to the contrary by our Treasurer (Mr Keating), Australia still has a long way to go before it can retreat from heading down the Argentinean road about which we heard so much of a couple of years ago. The latest balance of trade deficit confirms this point. We have a deficit of $1.6 billion; yet the Government tells us continually that it is still the greatest government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some improvement in the unemployment rate. This time last year the figure was about 7.6 per cent and at present it is about 6.4 per cent. We should bear in mind, of course, that a new bunch of school leavers is about to join the job market. Increased employment can be mainly attributed to the buoyant mining, agriculture and building trade sectors. While the two great industries of agriculture and mining employ immense numbers of people, the multiplier effect means that extra labour is employed in related and service fields, such as in the manufacturing sector. I refer to the manufacture of machinery and chemicals and to a host of other enterprises. Transport, to which I will refer later, relies on agriculture and mining for a vast amount of its turnover. </PARA>
<PARA> The buoyant housing sector, brought about in no small measure by the drop in interest rates 12 months ago, the removal by the Government of the ban on negative gearing on rented properties and the placing of capital gains tax on everything except private housing, have contributed to the uplifting in employment in Australia. Interest rates are again a point of concern. If the present uplift continues as it has in the last couple of months, there will be the same round of mortgagee sales in about six months time as occurred after the last disastrous interest rates hike. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a couple of articles which bear out what I am saying. The Treasurer is increasing interest rates as a tool to slow down the overheating economy. But the effect of using that tool depends on what part of Australia's economy one belongs to. As a farmer, I am not responsible for the overheated economy which has been brought about by a reliance on excessive imports. The farmers are providers, along with the mining industry, of exports. I do not believe that we should share in this high interest rate hike. The overheating of the economy has been caused by sections of secondary industries that have been tied to the Government's apron strings for far too long. Many of them have been receiving what has been called temporary assistance since about 1900. It is time that they were put out on their own to compete with the rest of the world on an even playing field, in the same way as the agriculture and mining industries do, to see whether they can improve-and improve smartly-without giving in to every union demand that may be made. </PARA>
<PARA> An article which I consider should be compulsory reading for all members of this chamber-not only those who are present at the moment-was written by Senator Stone and appeared in the Australian of Thursday, 24 November 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to raise interest rates stems from Mr Keating's belated acceptance that the balance of payments deficit is again blowing out. Unless demand for imports can be checked, in six months the situation will be clearly inappropriate for measures such as his promised major real tax cut, which will add to that demand and worsen the balance of payments even more. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988-89 Budget once again failed to cut the Commonwealth's own spending programs (as distinct from cutting back on funding for the States). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government cut funding to the States, but it failed to cut its own spending. Senator Stone said that the welcome move to a Budget surplus had been achieved by a much higher tax intake. The Government chose, yet again, to spend this as it went along. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The real heart of Australia's economic problems today is in any case centred on our appalling productivity performance. This is an area where the Government has talked but done little. </PARA>
<PARA>In this article Senator Stone referred to a new document produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on productivity entitled Australian National Accounts: Gross Product Employment and Houses worked. It gives an estimate of real gross domestic product, that is GDP, per unit of labour-in short, labour productivity-in terms of both the number of persons employed and the number of hours worked. Two alternative calculations were proposed. I will refer to the one that is kindest to the Government. During the last three years since we turned the corner on the Argentinean road, using the GDP measure, we find that there was only a 1.6 per cent productivity improvement, which equates to 0.5 per cent per annum. The other method is calculated in terms of GDP per hour worked. The increase in productivity terms was even less, and equated to 0.4 per cent per annum. Of course, that shows in which area Australia is falling down. This Government has done nothing whatsoever to increase productivity. As I have said many times, it is only our exporting industries, agriculture and mining, that are helping our balance of payments situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to sound like the prophet of doom this evening, or at any time for that matter. I am mostly the opposite. I am normally an optimist. But, if this Government keeps using interest rates as a tool to combat the current account deficit, I am afraid that doom will soon arrive. On the point of housing, I must condemn the Government for failing to attract suitable migrants, those skilled migrants in the building trades, to overcome the shortage of skilled tradesmen in this industry. I have said time and time again in this place that there is a housing boom in Australia at present. We go nowhere near attracting the labour we need from overseas. We certainly do not have the labour we need in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While migrants today are being comfortably set up in businesses, professions or fast food chains or as social security customers, they are not being sought to take up the slack that exists, that is, in country areas or in the building trades. I know that we have interest from bricklayers from the United Kingdom. What does this Government do? It does not even class bricklaying as a trade. Is it because of endless restrictions or union pressure? In the past year the rate for bricklaying has risen from $250 per thousand to at least $450 per thousand and that, incidentally, is in the city. There is a list a kilometre long every morning in the papers of advertisements for bricklayers to fill the shortage. While the shortage exists in the city, how can one expect to get bricklayers in the country? Of course, the people in the country are entitled to have a style of living equal to that which is available in the city. The minimum country people can ask for, if they can afford it, is a brick house or even a brick veneer house. Prefabricated buildings lack a sense of permanency when they are erected. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to specifics. I, firstly, address industry's greatest asset or liability, that is, road funding. There is a need now for a more generous distribution of road funding to the States, bearing in mind the total collected in the name of roads, so that road construction and maintenance can proceed at a rate that meets the demands made on roads because of increased mining and tourist activity, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> As every senator will no doubt know, the Government collects in excess of $6 billion in fuel taxes but spends only $1.2 billion on road improvements. The figure of $1.2 billion has remained static for the last four, now approaching five, years. It gives an effective reduction in road funding, in real terms, of approximately 40 per cent over that time. As I said, the Government returns to the taxpayer only $1.2 billion or, one-fifth of what it collects. In other words, of the 21.53c per litre that is collected, only 4.76c per litre goes back to the road user. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were serious and prepared to take the matter on, it would need to allocate only another 2c to make a figure 6.76c per litre out of the 21.53c figure and that would provide an extra $420m per annum. That figure would go a long way to making roads more efficient and safe. At present at least 30 per cent of accidents are attributed to the roads because of broken surfaces, potholes, bad camber, narrow lanes, sharp curves, blind corners and poor signposting. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, I wish to mention the situation of some constituents of mine, who live in the cattle country near Wyndham in Western Australia. When I was there in June they pointed out to me that the only way they could go to take stock 400 miles east to market, which would be to Katherine, I presume, would be by going immediately west via Derby and to get around the Top, and that would add an extra 800 kilometres. This is a disgraceful situation. It is an act of irresponsibility for the Government not to allocate funding so that primary producers can get their product out when it is supposed to go to market and not have to do so at only certain times of the year when the weather changes, by which time the beef may have gone off. </PARA>
<PARA> With reference to the priority of roads, there is a cut from the centennial roads grants for next year. Honourable senators should note that we are going from the bicentennial road development scheme which was implemented by Malcolm Fraser in about 1980-81. It was a very successful program that tried to bring the roads of Australia up to the standard that Australia deserves. I notice that there is a cut in spending to come. </PARA>
<PARA> More responsibility should be shown by the Commonwealth and the States themselves in agreeing on what major roads are to be upgraded. In Western Australia we have had the case of the Great Northern Highway which goes through Newman and eventually finishes up at Port Hedland. The bitumen goes only as far as Newman, just as it did quite a few years ago. The rest of the highway is gravel. The obvious and logical course to follow would have been to bituminise that highway as part of the north-west highway. But for some unknown reason the Labor State Government under Peter Dowding-a temporary State government, I can assure honourable senators-probably aided by the Commonwealth Government, although I am not too sure about that, decided to build a completely new road of about 400 kilometres for the tourist trade but it did not fit in with any mining whatsoever. Someone's priorities were mightily wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to shipping. Honourable senators are well aware that shipping, especially coastal shipping, has a lot to do with the freight rates and costs around Australia for mining, agriculture and other industries. In the mid-1980s, following the report of the Crawford Committee on the Revitalisation of Australian Shipping, incentives were provided to encourage unions to reduce manning levels on dry bulk carriers and coastal tankers from the mid and high 30s to the mid and high 20s. </PARA>
<PARA> In association with the provision of new vessels and the refitting of others, a 20 per cent reduction in manning levels was accomplished. When the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC) was established in 1986, further recommendations were made in an effort to bring manning levels into line with compatible countries. Again this was connected to vessel acquisition and modification which would permit reductions in manning levels. </PARA>
<PARA> However, by June 1988 only one MIDC vessel had been introduced. Additionally, in the IAC report on coastal shipping it is pointed out that the manning benchmark under the MIDC is still 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher than applies to vessels of other maritime countries with a similar standard of living. By mid-year less than 25 per cent of coastal shipping had been replaced with lower manning levels. The average manning level on vessels exceeding 1,000 tonnes dry weight was still 30. Clearly, we have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly more remains to be done through government initiatives and consultations to achieve the desired results. Ship based operating costs have improved during the 1980s but our levels are higher than those of other maritime nations, due to capital, crew, fuel, port charges and other costs such as repairs and maintenance. I refer honourable senators to a section of the IAC report where it refers to the cost component in millions of dollars. The capital cost for coastal shipping was $4.365m; the figure for crew was $2.883m; the figure for fuel was $2.040m; the figure for other costs was $1.953m; and the figure for port charges was $1.814m. This totalled $13.055m. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of capital costs, provisions of the Navigation Act with added union demands lead to extra costs for current Australian new and second-hand vessels meeting manning levels and accommodation demands which are, as mentioned, higher than in comparable countries. For example, a 100,000 dead weight tonnes bulk carrier's initial operation costs are up by $2m and its annual operating costs by $0.25m, when complying with these requirements. I will not go through all these things, but our crewing costs when compared with those of other countries are completely unreasonable. Australian ship operators employ 2.2 crew per berth compared to 1.5 per berth in Western Europe. This means that the cost of employing 31 crew members in Australia equates with employing 69 crew members in Europe; that is, crew costs per berth are inflated by 30 per cent, a cost impost of $29,000 per berth annually or $0.09m in overall annual impost costs. To move to MIDC crew levels and requirements would save $1.6m, which is 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiation factors related to crewing levels are determined by the Navigation Act, which places sea going unions in a very powerful position because ship operators do not have access to alternatives. Costs are also exaggerated by the operation of the seamen's engagement system which, as honourable senators probably know, is a pooled employment scheme which involves administrative costs and the payment of attendance money to eligible seamen not assigned to a ship. We could go on all night about this. I think honourable senators know full well the story about shipping around Australia and the cost it adds to agriculture, mining and manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to local government. One of the major issues of concern to some shire councils in my State of Western Australia concerns the program under which they have taken control of airstrips from the State or Federal Government. I think five years ago the aerodrome local ownership plan was developed, whereby local shires took over their own airstrips and maintained them on a joint basis with funding from the Federal Government. I am afraid the Federal Government has reneged on a lot of the deals that were made. The Government has announced that no more funds will be available this financial year or the next financial year. In the meantime, shires such as Kununurra have had to increase their passenger charges by 166 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may have read in the press in the last few days about the case of Port Hedland in Western Australia. Five years ago the shire took over the local airport under the local ownership plan. Before the takeover the Government was supposed to spend $240,000 to bring it up to scratch. I do not know whether the Government ran out of time or money, but this was not done. So the shire was asked to take over the airport-which it did-and the Government was to spend the $240,000 later on. Since 1983 the Shire of Port Hedland has allocated some $350,000 to match what the Government should have given it, but the Federal Government has failed to come up with its contribution. Not only that, but the Government has also failed to spend the $240,000. So we now have an airstrip that can take 737 aircraft and smaller. A 727 can land and so can a 767, I believe, but when they get to the end of the runway they cannot turn around. So it is impossible to use this airstrip for big aircraft. Port Hedland has been endeavouring in the last few years to get on the tourist run, along a route which would start in Cairns and from there go to Alice Springs, to Port Hedland and out of the country, or vice versa. So the shire has been trying to get the airport up to scratch for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to wanting to provide the people who live in the Pilbara region with the ability to get into and out of the country on holidays, the shire wanted to develop, in conjunction with about four other shires, the tourist potential of the Hamersley Ranges area of Western Australia. For the benefit of those who have not seen the Hamersley Ranges, they would rival Kakadu National Park any day-and not only that, it also has a climate that allows it to be visited nine months of the year. Probably only in January and February would it be too uncomfortable to visit whereas, from my observation, I would say that there are only five months in which one can visit Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> So since 1983 the shire in Port Hedland has been promised money from the Federal Government to upgrade its airport. This year's Budget has been brought down, and the Government has said an allocation will not be made in next year's Budget either. If I am right the only allocations for airports under the local ownership plan were about $0.09m for an airport somewhere up in north Queensland and a very small amount somewhere else and, as I have indicated, it has already been said that there will be no allocation next year. When the shire took over the airport in 1983 it had a budget of about $700,000 to complete the whole aerodrome and bring it up to national standard. But this delay has caused the cost to go up to such an extent that I now believe it would take close to $2m to bring that airport up to scratch, and unfortunately Port Hedland shire has decided to go it alone and bring the terminal generally up to scratch so that it can at least be used. But obviously millions of dollars must be spent on the strip and the shire will not be able to handle that itself. </PARA>
<PARA> My time is coming to a close and I would like to mention quickly the wheat industry. I have seen no allocation in the Appropriation Bills for wheat underwriting for next year. That causes me concern. As honourable senators will know, new wheat marketing legislation is being considered and I am worried about the sort of wheat marketing Act we may have next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to mention briefly the lack of funds allocated to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for the improvement of regional transmitters. As honourable senators will know, parliamentary broadcasts have already been shifted to standby transmitters, pending the completion of more powerful transmitters, but no money has been allocated and it does not look like it will be for a while. Parliamentary broadcasts are not my only concern. There will certainly be a lack of communications facilities for other purposes as well. Also, I was very saddened to see in the press reports of the cutbacks to the allocation for rural information programs such as the Country Hour. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by pointing out that since this Government has been in power it has let the current account deficit rise out of all proportion and, while cutting spending where it is needed most, it wants to increase taxes to record levels. I am very disappointed, and these problems are problems that we will address when in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not so long ago that all of us were impressed by the pictures we saw and the stories we read of the floods in Bangladesh and the tragedy that befell that country. But, as so often happens, after seeing the stories on television and the photographs in the newspapers for two or three nights, for most of us that is just about the end of it. Those in Bangladesh cannot escape so easily and will be living with the consequences of the disaster for some considerable time. I was pleased to see Australia follow up its initial response of providing $350,000 in financial aid and $1m worth of food and material aid with a $25m aid program over three years. This was a recognition of the long-term nature of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is hard for us to come to terms with the enormity of what has occurred. I would like to cite some of the statistics. The area that has been affected by the floods is 83,709 square kilometres; the number of people affected is 45 million; 70,000 hectares of crops were wiped out; more than 12 million homes were completely destroyed and about 24 million were partially destroyed; a million cattle were lost; and 60,000 kilometres of roads, 600 kilometres of railway lines, 44 bridges, and more than 8,000 educational institutions were damaged or destroyed. One can hardly take in the enormity of these figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the task ahead for the country is to rebuild its infrastructure and re-establish its crops and agricultural areas devastated by the floods, just in order to feed the population. However, if this effort is not to be in vain there is another aspect to what must be done to aid the people of Bangladesh, and that relates to flood prevention. Floods in South East Asian countries are occurring with increasing frequency. Waters pour down from the Himalayas onto the plains not only of Bangladesh but also of India, which had a considerable amount of its territory flooded, and of China. The main rivers contributing to the Bangladesh flood were the Ganges, the Megna, the Brahmaputra and their tributaries, all of which originate outside Bangladesh, in the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas, and have traversed China, Nepal, Bhutan, India and Bangladesh before arriving at the Bay of Bengal. </PARA>
<PARA> Meaningful flood measures will require the cooperation of a number of governments in the area. More interest needs to be taken in the problem. A joint program is needed for any real progress to be made. In the interests of the peoples of the whole region, not just Bangladesh, the international community must bring its expertise to the problem to ensure that efforts are made to bring these countries together to come up with a solution. Without that, the tragedy we have seen this year is likely to be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Australian Government will pursue the matter-in addition to the money that has been given-whenever it is able to in one of the international forums. Australia should use its influence in the United Nations and other forums to see that what expertise is available is given to the countries in the region. Having given aid, we should not forget that the flood has occurred, but should continue to look for ways to solve the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most recently available aerial survey results for Red and Grey kangaroos from all those States where commercial harvesting is permitted come from 1987 surveys in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. These surveys were undertaken by a number of organisations including State and Commonwealth wildlife authorities and universities. Population estimates in 1987 of areas aerially surveyed are:</PARA>

<PARA> These estimates are based on correction factors developed by Dr G. Caughley and his co-workers in 1976. Recent work has shown these correction factors to underestimate Grey Kangaroo populations. The areas covered in 1987 did not cover the entirety of each State and for Western Australia and Queensland were not entirely coincident with areas previously surveyed in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> Data from the 1987 surveys are currently being collated for comparison with previous nation-wide surveys in 1980-81 and 1984 with a view to publishing results in a scientific journal. Until this analysis is completed, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the 1987 and 1984 surveys.</PARA>
<PARA> For the other two species of commercially harvested kangaroos (the Whiptail wallaby and Euro) aerial surveys cannot be conducted in most of their habitat range. For these species populations are monitored using indirect measures and ground surveys.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987 there has been no approved management program under the Commonwealth Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 to permit the export of wallabies taken in Tasmania. I understand that Tasmania continues to monitor populations of Bennetts and Rufous Wallabies using ground surveys. Aerial surveys are not conducted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The 1988 quotas for Queensland were announced on 18 May 1988 following approval of the Queensland management program under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, analysis of population data and consideration by the National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos. The Queensland Minister and his wildlife authority were dissatisfied with the quota levels established for Red Kangaroos and Wallaroos and sought a review. The commercial harvesting of these two species was halted by Queensland authorities on 11 June 1988 for Red Kangaroos and 9 July 1988 for Wallaroos. Although aerial surveys of the Queensland pastoral zone in late May 1988 indicated that population of these two species had increased, I was not prepared to entertain a review of the quotas given that the quota for Red Kangaroos had been exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of problems with quota compliance during 1985, all States operating approved kangaroo management programs gave undertakings in 1986 to improve the administration of the commercial kill to ensure quota compliance. Since then, the quota system has functioned successfully as an additional safeguard to ensure conservation of the species involved by setting a conservative upper limit on the total commercial kill for each species.</PARA>
<PARA> Although Queensland had administrative problems with the Red Kangaroo quota this year, compliance has been achieved for Wallaroos and greater care is being taken to ensure compliance for Eastern Grey Kangaroos and Whiptail Wallabies.</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the kangaroo management program and quotas proposed by Queensland for 1989 I will take cognizance of the administration of the 1988 kangaroo management program and quotas by that State and relevant advice on possible further action to ensure quota compliance.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Killing of kangaroos, either for commercial use or non-commercially, in Queensland is subject to the provisions of the State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government cannot stop commercial or non-commercial killing of kangaroos in any State.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has power to approve management programs and to regulate the exports of products derived from approved management programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No, the Environment Assessment Branch (EAB) of the Department currently has a staff of 15 persons full-time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The proposal itself is very complex and has the potential to impact on virtually every element of the biophysical and socio-economic environment in the Jervis Bay region, and to a lesser, but nevertheless important extent on Sydney. As a result, the EIS and associated public review and assessment process will probably be one of the most complex to be dealt with under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As with other major proposals dealt with in the Environment Assessment Branch, the Jervis Bay proposal will, during the assessment process, require a varying level of resource commitment. At peak times, it is likely that all three officers in the Commonwealth Proposals Section will be involved, with one of these working full-time on the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> Resource allocation for all proposals dealt with in the Branch is planned by considering the timing of the various proposals and stages in the assessment process, and setting priorities accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is not presently planned that staff levels in the Environment Assessment Branch will be increased. Resource planning and frequent appraisal of workloads and priorities ensure that the Department's responsibilities for assessing proposals under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 are fulfilled. However, to improve the effectiveness of the Act's administration, and to achieve the goals outlined in the Department's  1988-89 Budget Explanatory Notes, in such areas as monitoring, review of environmental impact assessment techniques, promotion of public participation, education, development/finalisation of memoranda of understanding, staff development and the improvement of the Branch information base additional resources would be required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I wrote to the Managing Director of the sports car manufacturer, Giocattolo Motori Pty Ltd, on 19 August 1988 to advise the company that I could not accede to its request for duty-free entry for transaxles additional to that already available to the company.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's By-Law for Export Scheme is relevant to the company's plans. The Scheme is part of the Government's strategy to encourage the development of innovative, export-oriented companies. It provides the opportunity for duty-free entry into Australia for most of the transaxles involved because of the company's stated intention to export the majority of its vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is correct that transaxles are not manufactured in Australia at present. In representations to me, the company has claimed that the duty would add $6,000 to the cost of the vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The question of any delay in granting duty-free entry for the company's imports of transaxles does not arise. As indicated in (1) above duty-free entry for most of the transaxles involved is already available. For the small proportion of Giocattolo vehicles which is destined for the domestic market, duty free entry of transaxles would put at risk the continuing success of the PMV Plan. Given the major economic benefits to all Australians of a successful outcome of the Plan, this is a risk the Government is not prepared to take.</PARA>
