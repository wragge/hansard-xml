<PARA> X-rated video material contravenes Christian moral beliefs in that,</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the status of both women and men are degraded by the material,</PARA>

<PARA> That we are concerned that the Judeo-Christian moral values which have been fundamental in our laws and education systems since the foundation of the country are now being undermined in the current practice of law making, and we are concerned that the values of the secular-humanistic philosophy have taken their place therefore jeopardizing the moral climate of our society and contributing towards immorality and violence in our society.</PARA>

<PARA>The Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to the procedures laid down by the resolutions of the Senate of 25 February 1988, Senator MacGibbon has raised with me a matter of privilege. The matter in question was set out in considerable detail by Senator MacGibbon during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-1989 on 29 November 1988, and involves an allegation that misleading evidence was given to Estimates committees in relation to a defence procurement program known as Project Parakeet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resolutions of the Senate declare that the intentional giving of any evidence which is false or misleading in any material particular is a contempt. Under the resolutions I am required to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have pre- cedence, having regard to the criteria set out in the resolutions. In previous statements on matters of privilege I have indicated the way in which I applied the criteria contained in the resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA> I consider that the matter raised by Senator MacGibbon is capable of being regarded by the Senate, if the facts are found as alleged by Senator MacGibbon, as meeting the criteria provided in the resolutions, namely that the Senate's powers should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct the Senate, its committees or senators. It is certainly not a trivial matter within the terms of the criteria, and there does not appear to be any readily available other remedy. I have therefore determined that a motion relating to the matter should have precedence in accordance with the procedures contained in the resolutions.</PARA>

<PARA> (d) remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) in the Senate on Monday, 28 November 1988, when he dismissed the airlines' comments as being no more than `millenarian, dramatic, tub thumping' and his previous comments in Senate estimates hearings when he dismissed a third runway for Sydney Airport as being `not a credible, viable or financially, environmentally or politically acceptable option'; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) this arrogant and ignorant attitude is typical of the position the Federal Government has taken in relation to the problems at Sydney Airport which will condemn hundreds of thousands of travellers who use Sydney Airport to further massive delays and which will expose them to an increased risk of a major accident; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it the view of the Government that the Yugoslav security officer who shot an Australian protester committed an offence under Australian law? Was not the officer therefore liable to be arrested if and when he left the consular premises? Does the Government argue that when it chose to abandon that option-some might say obligation-and to expel the consulate, it then assumed an obligation under international law to protect the officer, even against arrest for breaches of criminal law previously committed? Has not the Government now set a precedent whereby consular officers who shoot protesters on Australian soil will not be prosecuted? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the circumstances of this whole affair are well enough known to Senator Hill for me not to need to retail them in any detail. It has been the view of the Government, and it remains its view, that an offence was committed for which no claim of diplomatic or consular immunity could have been made. But there was, of course, the de facto immunity associated with the person's remaining in the shelter of consular premises, which made impossible the practical arrest of that person until, arguably, such time as he moved out or the status of the consulate changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, when we made the decision, for reasons that I do not think I need again to retail, to go down the road of closing the consulate and, in effect, terminating the functions of all the consular officials, which is necessarily involved in such a closure, we found ourselves committed by the terms of article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to ensure safe passage of all the staff and dependants of the consulate out of the country.</PARA>
<PARA> As I made clear at the time, the circumstance was regrettable. As I also said publicly last week, in some sense the circumstance was also ironical in that the act of closure and expulsion thus acquires, under this interpretation and application of the Vienna Convention, a greater degree of immunity after that decision is made than was the case before. But that is a consequence of the strict application of article 26. We were encouraged in our reading of article 26 in those terms by about the only text book that apparently has ever been written on the subject of the Vienna Convention-one that seems to have escaped, along with most other things, the attention of Mr Spender-that is, Dr Lee's book of 1966 on the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which makes the point, quite specifically canvassing this sort of situation where a consular official is properly gaoled or subject to gaoling, whether or not the circumstances of the closure of his mission and the termination of his functions would require an obligation of safe passage under article 26 to be exercised. The answer given by Dr Lee is yes.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge, as a lawyer, that an alternative construction is possible when one looks at article 26 and weighs and measures it against the possible application of article 41, which is the one that deals with the possible application of criminal law when offences are committed. But it is a legal argument that would have been, as a practical matter, extremely difficult to test in an environment that was extremely volatile, as I think we are all well aware. Moreover, Australia is very conscious of its international reputation in its observance of the consular and diplomatic conventions and very conscious of the international perceptions of the way in which this article should be applied. There is no doubt that the perception of the international lawyers associated with the Department and all those whose views they were able to canvass were along the lines that Australia had such an obligation.</PARA>
<PARA> The conventions are based on centuries of diplomatic practice and comprise a major principle of diplomatic law, whether we like it or not, in its application in this case. So all those views were well canvassed last week, both internally within the Government and in discussions I had with the New South Wales Government. They were amicably canvassed with the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, with whom I had a further round of discussions. He took the view, as I did, that the Commonwealth Government had no alternative but to follow the course that it did. He offered the cooperation of the New South Wales police authorities, and I am very glad that that cooperation was received.</PARA>
<PARA> I can understand Mr Howard reacting, as he apparently did this morning, to shore up the lame, the halt and the blind among his shadow Ministers and I can understand his feeling the need to leap to the defence of Mr Spender, who leapt into the fray with such enthusiasm on the subject last week. But I regard what he said as being at odds with his very strong, very unambiguous, very unequivocal support for the Government's expulsion ultimatum that was made last week and everything else that went with it. I think it is regrettable that this matter is being pursued in this half-baked way by the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot expect Senator Hill to appreciate fully the legal niceties of this question if his own Queen's Counsel in his front bench ranks cannot appreciate the niceties himself. Once one closes a consulate and terminates the consulate officials, the difficulty is that the obligation of safe passage applies to all members of the consulate concerned. As to the setting of precedents, one hopes of course that this situation will not recur. It is not the first time it has occurred. An analagous situation has occurred in the past. It will be recalled that Britain, in the case of the Libyan murder that occurred there, was in a similar situation for a different set of legal reasons. But the result was the same: Britain felt that it had no course open to it other than to expel the whole Libyan Embassy staff, knowing perfectly well that one of the people it was throwing out was in fact the murderer. We have had enough hypocrisy and superficial indignation from the Opposition on this matter. Honourable senators opposite are incapable of any careful and considered response to a delicate diplomatic situation or any other matter involving good government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand Senator Gietzelt's concern. It is very unfortunate that Senator McLean made this prediction without any factual basis at all. I am sure that many veterans would have been concerned by the statement that was made that there was some doubt as to the future of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I am sure that Senator Macklin was also concerned that the Canberra Times reported him as making this claim. I can certainly assure Senator Gietzelt and, indeed, Senator McLean, that this prediction is no more than a figment of Senator McLean's imagination. Last year when the Prime Minister announced new administrative arrangements in the Public Service he gave an absolute commitment to having a separate Department of Veterans' Affairs. At that time, the Prime Minister said that there would be a separate department for as long as was necessary. I think we can all appreciate that it will be necessary to have a separate department to care for the needs of the veterans community for many years to come. It is important to go beyond that assurance because obviously it is an issue of concern to all honourable senators and many veterans. I would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that only last week the Department of Veterans' Affairs released its corporate plan which sets out its broad direction for the next five years. It is patently apparent that a department that has just released its corporate plan is in no danger of disappearing.</PARA></TALK.START>

I absolutely assure Senator Gietzelt that the Department will remain. I thank him for the opportunity to clarify this issue on behalf of Minister Humphreys.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article to which Senator Giles referred. Unfortunately, like a number of other articles which examine this issue, it does so without a full examination of the issues involved. It ignores some of the most recent government initiatives in this area, initiatives that have been geared towards alleviating the sort of problems that the article refers to. The Government's policies in this area are designed to improve disposable income. In doing so, there are two considerations about which we are concerned. We are concerned about enhancing independence, and we are concerned about increasing participation in the community by those whom these policies are geared to assist. We are also well aware that there are some groups which suffer a particular disadvantage more than other groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With this in mind the Government has implemented numerous reforms over the last few years which are designed not only to improve disposable income, but also, as I said, to enhance people's capacity and opportunity to participate in the community. It is this whole range of initiatives and decisions that this article, like others, completely ignores. The first and most important is the Government's introduction in 1987 of the family allowance supplement (FAS). That supplement is now being paid in respect of almost 360,000 children. It is paid at the same rate as the additional pension or benefit. Part of the aim of the initiative is to smooth the transition from income support to employment for these people. Integration of child payments with beneficiaries also significantly improves this transition.</PARA>
<PARA> I also note in respect of the family allowance supplement that as from January 1989 most families will continue to receive FAS for up to 12 months, regardless of changes in income. Already, it should be noted that income can change up to 25 per cent without persons losing their entitlement to FAS. It should be noted that with this one initiative we have already dampened the impact of effective marginal tax rates on people receiving FAS. But that has not been the only initiative the Government has taken. There is a list of others, and I can refer to six or seven of them. The child-free areas in the income test were raised--</PARA>

There were two other major initiatives taken in this year's Budget which were geared towards addressing the problem which Senator Giles raised, a problem which was not canvassed adequately by the article to which she referred. The jobs, education and training for sole parents (JET) scheme is geared specifically to assisting sole parents in their transition to employment. Individual JET advisers are being programmed to assist sole parents in a whole range of areas not only with training but also with child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major initiative that was introduced in the Budget was the New Start program. That program is geared towards assisting the long term unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Finance and Minister representing the Treasurer whether he is aware of a survey of Australia's leading corporations, conducted by the Australian newspaper, which showed that `interest bearing debt as a proportion of their total liabilities'-that is, of the corporations surveyed-`has grown from 23 per cent in 1984 to almost 40 per cent this year'.

Does the Minister know whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will be able to prevent the major banks endangering their depositors' money by chasing higher profits and lending at high interest rates to already indebted and risky companies?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly did not get down a note of all of the questions, but I did note the earlier ones. If there is anything that the Treasurer wishes to add to the later specific questions, I will pass that on if he provides it. I have not seen a report of the survey which was conducted by the Australian in which, if I got it down correctly, debt as a proportion of equity in Australian corporations has grown from 23 per cent to 40 per cent over some extended period. I recall last week, I think, giving an answer to a similar question that touched on that issue in which I pointed out that fashions change-even among the same group that is making the judgments-as to whether equity or debt is to be preferred. It was the almost ubiquitous fashion in the 1960s that debt was to be preferred to equity. It was enshrined in government regulations, if not in legislation, supported by all the major political parties-and, as far as I know, the minor particular parties as well-that there should be a minimum Australian equity content in development, particularly of large mining ventures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It flowed inevitably from that, due to the small size of the Australian capital market, that those mining ventures had to be financed predominantly by debt, usually borrowed from foreign banks. I do not know whether that was a good thing or not, but that was the generally supported policy at that time. My own view, as I said the other day, is that it would be better to have more equity and less debt. It was my view a very long time ago, too-not just when the fashion changed in the late 1970s or, more particularly, in the late 1970s and the mid-1980s. But in the end, that is a judgment about which there is no unequivocal right or wrong answer.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the statement that there should be no AAA ratings for corporations, that is a judgment which should be made by the people who are giving the AAA ratings. I do, however, make the point that when a bank-particularly a foreign bank-is lending to an Australian corporation, or any other corporation, it is making an assessment not just about likely movements in exchange rates, given the currency in which the loan might be denominated, but also the risk of default. That is not a question which is applicable to public debt, at least not for a country like Australia-or a debt incurred by the Commonwealth Government anyway. There have never been any serious doubts about whether there would be a default on those debts. The judgments, therefore, are made on the basis of likely exchange rate variations, rather than on the matter of default.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Childs also asked whether the Minister was satisfied with Australian export requirements for wine. I am satisfied. Under the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation export regulations, wine for export must be-as is described in the Act-`sound and merchantable and meet the standards and requirements of the country to which it is being exported'. The export standards are rigorously administered by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation through a system involving the licensing of exporters; sensory evaluation and analysis of samples prior to export; and subsequent random testing to check that the wine continues to be compatible with the original samples.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Senator Childs asked whether I believe that existing State regulations protect the buying public adequately. The domestic standards for wine, as for other food and beverages, are set out in the State laws. Those standards are developed under the umbrella of the National Health and Medical Research Council. All States have agreed to introduce uniform standards prepared by the Australian Food Standards Committee, which includes representatives of industry, the States and consumer bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had my attention drawn to an article which appeared in the Queensland Sunday Mail on 27 November. The article features a photograph of what it describes as a `harmless looking, slow loris', which is a monkey-like creature that is a prime carrier of rabies. The article also features a photograph of two star tortoises, which can act as intermediate hosts for rabies. The slow loris was smuggled into Brisbane. Because it is a potential host for rabies and is suspected of being a rabies carrier, its source of origin was checked. It is suspected of having come from Vietnam or the Philippines and its movements while in Australia are being tracked. If it has bitten anyone, it could cause a serious rabies outbreak in Australia. Prosecution of the smugglers is likely under the quarantine, Customs and wildlife protection legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is yet another example of what is, unfortunately, a problem for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service-continual efforts at smuggling by various individuals into and out of this country. Recently smuggled from Papua New Guinea was the dead skin and plumage of a bird of paradise. As well, someone recently tried to smuggle into Australia a stuffed cobra whose venom and fangs were still intact. Recently there was an attempt to smuggle in seven exotic parakeets. Recently, two nursery operators tried to smuggle in through the post from New Zealand 29 cuttings of magnolia and birch trees. That resulted in quarantine officers having to destroy over 200 trees following an outbreak of exotic fungal disease. The Quarantine Act provides for fines of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years for the illegal importation of birds and plants. We have been concerned that the gravity of the act of smuggling is not always taken into account when people are before the magistrate after being convicted of smuggling.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will indicate to Senator Walters that it is not boring because Australia's agricultural output is at risk if this type of activity continues unchecked. For example, 37 per cent of Australia's gross export revenue, and some 5 per cent of gross domestic product, is the contribution that agricultural industry makes to the economy of this country. If there were one outbreak of foot and mouth disease, it could cost this country in a single year between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. If honourable senators think there is a rare chance of that occurring, let me say that last year in Italy, a prime source for a number of travellers into Australia over the last year, there were 100 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. If there were one outbreak of newcastle disease or foul plague because of birds or eggs smuggled into Australia, it could result in considerable damage also to our $900m a year poultry industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have asked the officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to ensure, when charges are preferred against people caught smuggling and when convictions are recorded, that they brief the prosecutors thoroughly so that, at the point of delivering sentence, the magistrate understands fully the implications of and the dangers caused by people who engage in smuggling. One of the criticisms often made is that sometimes the sentence may not reflect the financial reward that smugglers may obtain. This has resulted recently in two aviculturists, convicted of the import of finches from Bangkok, having had their sentences increased upon appeal by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service from a two-year good behaviour bond to fines totalling $6,000 and $5,000 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a serious matter. It is not a matter to be treated lightly. It is not a matter to be ridiculed. It is a bit like a person falling from a 20-storey building; as he goes past the tenth floor window he says, `Well nothing has gone wrong yet'. We have a huge industry in Australia which will be at risk if something does go wrong. These penalties need to be fully enforced to guarantee that nothing does go wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Hand has provided me with information which canvasses the questions raised by Senator Tambling and I think it would be appropriate to detail that now. Mr Hand says that, in answer to a question put to him by the honourable member for Higgins on 8 November, he told the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I have met with representatives of that body and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. I am yet to make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hand further states:</PARA>
<PARA>On Thursday, December 1st I stated that I stood by that statement of November 8th. I stand by that answer and will demonstrate that there is nothing to substantiate any claim to the contrary. I have not made any Ministerial decision on the funding of NAIHO. This does mean that I have not discussed possible financing of NAIHO. I told the House last Thursday that discussions included mention of a figure of about $180,000 to $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to examine the discussions about the future of NAIHO in a proper context. My consistent position has been that unless NAIHO undertook restructuring it would not be considered for funding. This was stated in a letter to NAIHO on February 15 this year. This letter was tabled in the Senate last week. On August 1st I received a submission from NAIHO and in response to that I met with representatives of the organisation on August 31st to discuss restructuring and possible funding. It was agreed at that meeting that NAIHO again look at funding proposals as their claims were unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> The following day, September 1st, an officer of my Department, Mr McDonald, wrote a file note which he claimed recorded a brief conversation he had with me following that meeting. He was not present at the meeting. Mr McDonald's recollection was noted in a note from a Senior Officers Meeting held on September 5th. This note, which I became aware of following the question from the member for Higgins on November 8th, stated that: `The Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding.' This statement was incorrect and Mr McDonald agrees that my answers to Parliament are correct.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McDonald acknowledged that my answer of November 8th was correct during a telephone conference call that afternoon. This followed a meeting in my office when the question and my answer were discussed with Senior Officers. This meeting led to my re-entering the House following Question Time to clarify the nature of a report about which Mr Shipton had also sought information in his question. It was decided at this meeting that I telephone Mr Shipton to clear the situation regarding the Auditor's report of NAIHO. I did this.</PARA>
<PARA> Also at that meeting with Senior Officers, it was quite obvious that then was the time to make any further correction to the information I had provided to the House, if such action was considered necessary. The Senior Officers confirmed my version of events and no addition or correction was necessary. The Senior Officers at that meeting signed a note on December 1st confirming this and this note was tabled in Senate last week. As can be seen clearly, there is no indication from any of this that I misled the House about there being no decision to fund NAIHO. There has been no decision.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I now go to further information about the continuing discussions concerning the restructuring and possible funding of NAIHO.</PARA>
<PARA> In a minute dated September 8th reference was made to an Auditor's report on NAIHO. This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention. In response to this minute my office wrote back to the Department asking if the problems highlighted had been corrected. The following day the Department responded by stating that all of the information indicated that `nothing had been done to correct the problems highlighted' but that there had been no first-hand discussions with NAIHO on the subject. This, as with all of the other available information, is entirely consistent with what I have stated all along. That is that no decision on funding for NAIHO was taken at the August 31st meeting with NAIHO. What has happened since then has been for myself and my office to continue to discuss with NAIHO the progress of restructuring and possible funding if that restructuring was acceptable. Before coming to the central point used by the Opposition in relation to this matter-that is the now discredited note by Mr McDonald-I would like to mention one other document. On September 1st I received a letter from NAIHO which discussed possible funding. This letter, which was not sought by me, talked of an agreement being reached at the August 31st meeting. This agreement was that the matter be further discussed. This letter also talked about an `indicative figure' of $193,000. This figure is NAIHO's figure. It does, however, fit within the broad range of $180,000 to $200,000 I stated in my answer last week. I see this letter as part of the continuing representation from NAIHO for funding for specific purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The material used by the Opposition last week centres on the recollection of Mr McDonald. As I have said, Mr McDonald has confirmed that my answer was accurate and consistent with his recollection of my advice to him on August 31st. This is stated in a note [dated 2 December] from Mr McDonald to the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Bill Gray.</PARA>
<PARA>I table that note, together with the other letter. The relevant paragraph of this note states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then read me the text of an answer he had given earlier that day to a question about his `decision' to fund NAIHO. I confirmed that the answer was accurate and consistent with my recollection of his advice to me after his meeting with NAIHO some weeks earlier. I have since read the relevant Hansard, which was consistent with the Minister's earlier reading to me, and have no reason to change my view of the accuracy of his reply.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Everything I have said and done in relation to this has been consistent. The record shows that since February this year I have been concerned about the whole matter. There is no material from myself to suggest action on funding of NAIHO could proceed. This is confirmed by Miss Glenda Humes who took over the handling of this matter from Mr McDonald in October. A file note to this effect has been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is important to state where things stand at the moment. On November 8th I asked if my request that NAIHO files be secured and set aside for investigation by the Auditor-General. This had been done and that is where things stand.</PARA>
<PARA> While I do not back away from the fact that I have discussed possible funding for NAIHO the record stands. No decision has been taken. Therefore I totally refute any suggestion that I have misled the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reported moves by newly elected municipal councils dominated by the conservative party in South Africa to reimpose so-called petty apartheid are, all too unhappily, predictable in the light of conservative gains in the recent municipal elections. However, reports of boycotts of white businesses by black consumers and of the severing of links with the municipalities in question by business and sporting organisations suggest that this turning back of the clock will not be cost free. Nonetheless, it is deplorable that these council moves, as humiliating as they are futile, have taken place. The South African Government professes to regret these moves, but the solution is in its hands. The Australian Government calls on it to repeal the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, which allows municipal councils in that country to impose these insulting and racist restrictions on the non-white population. I hope that the Opposition would join in, in a bipartisan way, and express its own objections to these developments. I have to say that I do not expect it to do so, not least in an environment in which it finds it possible to go on repeating, as it did yesterday in that load of reactionary flummery that was dropped, its objections to sanctions, the only available mechanisms that exist around the world to impose significant pressure on the racist regime of South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been informed of the following, which may be of benefit to Senator Dunn and the rest of the Senate: The functions and responsibilities of the Supervising Scientist are set out in the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978, and by undertaking these functions the Supervising Scientist enables the Government to assure Parliament, the Aboriginal traditional owners and the public that the environment of the region, including Kakadu National Park, is being adequately protected. The provision of technically sound independent advice on the achievement of this high level of protection of the environment of the region is primarily the responsibility of the Supervising Scientist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of proposals to merge elements of ANSTO, CSIRO and OSS. These issues will be taken up in the forthcoming review. This is to be an internal Government review on the functions and role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Research is essential to ensure that measures implemented to protect the environment, particularly in the long term, are soundly based. Because of its unique role in the region and, indeed, in Australia, the OSS has highly developed experience, expertise and research facilities not found in other agencies such as ANSTO, CSIRO or the Northern Territory supervising authorities. For example, competence in freshwater aquatic ecotoxicology, essential for the control and monitoring of any release of mine site waste water to the environment, has not been established in any Northern Territory Government agency, nor are facilities comparable to those built up by the Supervising Scientist at Jabiru available to ANSTO or CSIRO. I think I might be assisting the Senate if I ask for the next four paragraphs to be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The paragraphs read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The environment must not only be properly protected while mining is active; the disposal of uranium mill tailings, of low grade radioactive ore and of huge quantities of waste rock has very important implications for the long term future. The Supervising Scientist is a crucial element in the process leading to the decisions that must be made in decommissioning of Ranger and rehabilitating the site acceptably when mining is complete.</PARA>
<PARA> ERA's claim that OSS duplicate the work of the Northern Territory suggests that ERA does not understand the role the Commonwealth expects of the OSS. It also appears to be unaware of the efforts made in the early days of the establishment of the Office to ensure that overlap and duplication between the OSS and the other bodies, including the Northern Territory authorities and mining companies, was minimised. The Government seeks from the Supervising Scientist independent assurances that the highest level of protection is being achieved in the region. In this role there is no overlap and there is certainly none in the area of environmental research.</PARA>
<PARA> It is most important to distinguish this kind of environmental research carried out by the Supervising Scientist from the development of mining and milling techniques and processes of direct interest to a mining company. The OSS was set up to satisfy the environmental concerns of the community, not to carry out applied research and development into engineering solutions to operational problems facing the mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA> All these matters will, however, be assessed again in a review of the OSS I propose be conducted in the near future as one of a number of reviews I am carrying out of agencies in my portfolio.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell Senator Messner how many of those jobs were full time. Nearly 72 per cent of those extra jobs are full time jobs. I thank Senator Messner for asking the question. As I have already said, that is in marked contrast to the record of the Fraser-Howard Government in its dying days and in very considerable contrast to the record of the Fraser-Howard Government in its previous 5 1/2 years before it went into its terminal decline. In addition to more jobs, since 1983 we have seen an end to short time working and a dramatic increase in overtime opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the effects of employment growth and employment decline on the welfare of Australian families, I would like to quote from an article that appeared in the London Economist of 26 November. The article was headed `Welfare and work'. Opposition senators will never learn anything while they are talking all the time. The only way they will ever learn anything is by listening and reading. The trouble is that they are always talking; that is why they never learn anything. The London Economist said:</PARA>
<PARA>Even the most generous welfare system is unlikely to be as good a cure for poverty as a job. It is work-</PARA>
<PARA>in the context of this article what that means is the unequal access to work-</PARA>
<PARA>that has made the distribution of household incomes more uneven.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could make the distribution of household incomes more uneven or contribute more to the average decline in household incomes than the loss of 200,000 jobs in the last 12 to 15 months that the Opposition was in government. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The contrast is less between families with a well paid and a badly paid breadwinner, more between two-income households and those with one income or none. It is work that has created the richest-ever generation of pensioners-and that now threatens to create a new generation of pensioner-poor-</PARA>
<PARA>this, of course, is in the context of the United Kingdom where retirement incomes are related to lifetime earnings-</PARA>
<PARA>The people who have retired early after long spells out of the job market in the 1980s. It is work that offers the only way to get a lone mother a decent life, without paying her so much in welfare that she is discouraged from marrying for fear of losing her benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>It is work that this Government has provided at an almost uniform rate over 5 1/2 years at a sustained rate of employment growth. That is without precedent in Australia since reliable statistics have been kept, and that is in marked contrast to the 200,000 people that lost their jobs in the last 15 months of the Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Stone, by way of interjection, said something about foreign debt. Let me remind Senator Stone again that the Fraser-Howard Government in its terminal year chalked up a current account deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) while simultaneously driving the country into the worst depression that it had seen since the 1930s. It takes real skill both to record a huge current account deficit of 4 per cent of GDP at the same time as one is presiding over a depression. I suggest that no other government in Australia's history has ever been able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition is really interested, as distinct from mouthing rhetoric about the welfare of Australian families, I suggest it concentrate more on employment creation, on giving Australians the greatest opportunity that they could have to lift their living standards and get out of poverty, and that is the opportunity to get a job. The Opposition will learn something about that if it takes notice of what this Government has done and it looks back, instead of to the 1950s, to 1981-82 and tries to avoid repeating the mistakes that it made then. Unfortunately, there is no indication yet that it has any intention of doing so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 November 1988 Senator Haines asked me a question about corporate taxation paid by the Bond Corporation. At the end of that answer I said that I would seek additional advice from the Treasurer regarding the matter. The Treasurer makes the point, which I think I made on that occasion, that it is not possible to comment on the taxation affairs of an individual company because the provisions of the taxation laws prevent the Commission of Taxation releasing such information other than for prescribed purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did say something about the Cook Islands as a tax haven and the fact that that had been closed off, we believed, in the context of the May statement this year. There is a somewhat lengthy answer about that. Again, I seek leave to have that answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Treasurer's statement of May 1988 it is proposed that income from that source will be taxed much more severely from July 1989 as accrued taxation rather than as repatriated. The Treasury has been involved in consultation over the proposed arrangements and a final announcement as to the provisions that will apply in July 1989 has not yet been made.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question why the Government has decided to reduce the rate of company tax it must be remembered that this is proposed as part of a revenue neutral tax reform which will also see a substantial broadening of the business tax base. The taxation measures announced in the May Economic Statement included the removal of 5/3 accelerated depreciation, the termination of the income tax exemption of the gold mining industry, and the imposition of an accruals tax regime on income generated by Australians through overseas tax havens.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the more efficient tax system and economic structure which will flow from these reforms, it can be expected that the burden of tax will be imposed more fairly as a result. The reduction in the company tax rate virtually by definition, is only of benefit to those who have been paying tax, while the base broadening measures will often mean an increase in tax for those who have borne a lower effective rate, or paid no tax at all, in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall also table a couple of documents. One document relates to a question asked by Senator Crichton-Browne during Question Time. I think the other set of documents have already been given to Senator Tambling, who may have shown them to Senator Chaney. I table the minutes of a meeting on 31 August with Mr Shane Houston, Ms Margaret Culbong and Ms Chris George of NAIHO-this is document No. 1 that Senator Crichton-Browne asked for-and also attachment 2, which Senator Crichton-Browne also asked for. I draw the attention of the Senate to a further document dated 3 December received today by the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs from Mr McDonald. I table the document dated 3 December from Mr McDonald to the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I also table a minute dated 8 September from Mr McDonald to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs attaching the audit report of NAIHO. I also table a minute from the Minister's office to Mr McDonald dated 26 September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the key issue involved that appears within the documents. The question is whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs misled the Parliament in his answer to a question on 8 November asked by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). The document I have just tabled answers this key question. At paragraph 8 of his memo, Mr McDonald states:</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated in my note to you of 2 December, I agreed in our conversation that the Minister's answer was `consistent' with my recollection of the 31 August meeting. I thought then, and still do, that the answer the Minister gave in the House was loose enough to be `consistent', particularly in view of the possibility--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we should acknowledge here that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has asked that these documents be tabled without any request or demand made by members of the Opposition, probably without their knowledge that they existed. I think that that should be acknowledged in the spirit in which it is given. Paragraph 8 of Mr McDonald's memo continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . loose enough to be `consistent', particularly in view of the possibility of DEET funding and the doubts which had probably been raised in the Minister's mind by the audit report. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McDonald therefore again asserts that the Minister's answer of 8 November was correct. I also draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 5 of the document in which Mr McDonald makes a revealing comment about the accuracy of the minutes of the senior officers meeting of 5 September and upon which the Opposition relies to allege that the Minister misinformed the Parliament. Paragraph 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The minutes of the Senior Officers' meeting of September 5 are partly in error. My recollection is that I reported that the Minister had decided to fund NAIHO. There was some comment from several other officers including a question about the cost of this decision. I believe that I estimated the cost would be `about $180,000' but do not agree that I said that the Minister had `directed that NAIHO receive $180,000'. As you know, the SOM minutes are a much edited version of proceedings and should not be regarded as anything like a verbatim record. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, inaccuracies are identified by Mr McDonald in relation to a key document upon which the Opposition relies to bring its case against the Minister. Finally, the memo provides confirmation yet again that the Department had not received any written confirmation from the Minister concerning the alleged decision to fund NAIHO. The simple reason is that no decision had been taken and the Department has no formal decision which would authorise it to fund NAIHO. I remind the Senate of the original questions put by the honourable member for Higgins on 8 November. In summary, he asked the Minister: `Did the Minister's predecessor stop funding NAIHO? Has the Minister recommenced funding of NAIHO? Was his predecessor wrong in stopping the funding of NAIHO? Will the Minister have NAIHO investigated by the Auditor-General?'</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should note the answers given by the Minister to those questions on 8 November. In precis they were: `Yes, my predecessor did stop funding following a critical audit report. No, I am yet to make a decision'. No specific answer was given in respect of question 3. Fourthly, he said, `The NAIHO issue will be examined by those people who are undertaking the investigations'. The evidence shows that the Minister answered accurately and honestly in respect of these questions and it is clear that the Parliament has not been misled. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement and papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the Opposition will want some time to examine the rather detailed papers which have been tabled. However, I must say that a few preliminary comments are called for. Firstly, how would anyone here like to be in Mr McDonald's shoes? He has his Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), giving this extraordinary answer in the House of Representatives, and then this call from the Minister and his senior officers to clarify the accuracy or otherwise of Mr McDonald's sundry minutes and comments on this matter. The thing which leaps from the pages that have been tabled by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus)-no doubt there are many other matters which will come out quite apart from the extraordinary comment that the Minister read that the reply of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was loose enough to be accurate, or words to that effect-is the letter from the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) dated 1 September. This letter was written by that organisation immediately after the meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Here we have the Minister and the Minister's surrogate asserting in the Senate that there was no agreement with respect to funding, and yet we find that on 1 September the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation was writing in very intimate terms to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Gerry,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to follow on from the discussions of yesterday relating to the funding of NAIHO. In undertaking the fine tuning of the agreement reached yesterday, I would ask that we consider the following points. </PARA>
<PARA>Then follow requests from NAIHO about some particular items of expenditure. The second last paragraph of the letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind the budget position as discussed, we would seek your agreement to a small increase in the indicative figure of $193,000 of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> With this additional amount we could absorb the costs associated with the above matters, bringing overall cost in under the broad limits we discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter bears out the obvious and clear meaning of the documents which were tabled last Thursday by Minister Tate, the surrogate who is not available to us today, unfortunately, for reasons of ill health. But in reality it is quite apparent that these documents confirm not only in the mind of Mr McDonald, because of what the Minister told him, but also in the mind of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation that it had an agreement which required some fine tuning. Of course that is utterly appropriate with the other documents tabled last Thursday. We find, for example, in the handwritten minute signed by Glenda Humes and dated 18 October exactly the same clear meaning. Glenda Humes says in that minute:</PARA>
<PARA>I raised the question of NAIHO funding again with Harriet Swift who apologised for the delay in sending the Department relevant information concerning the funding. She said-</PARA>
<PARA>I quote this part with some care-</PARA>
<PARA>there is some concern about the precise amount needed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear on the face of the documents we have that the Minister changed the decision of the previous Minister, which flowed from the appalling auditor's report on this organisation, and agreed to fund the organisation subject to some of the fine tuning and argument about details that had to come forward. We find a very grateful National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation recording in this same letter this changed relationship with the Government. After all, it had just been given the heave-ho by the previous and now discredited Minister, Clyde Holding. What did NAIHO say on 1 September? It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Both Margaret and I saw yesterday's discussion as frank and productive and certainly a change from the melee and suspicions which have dogged past negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that this brand new Minister re-established contact and communications with NAIHO, an organisation which had been thoroughly discredited by an independent auditor's report, and it is quite clear on the face of the document I have quoted from that there was agreement that this organisation would be funded again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone. That is precisely the agreement that was conveyed to Mr McDonald. Clearly, a great deal of careful examination is required of these documents. I welcome one point that has been raised by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer to the minute of Mr McDonald, although if the Minister does not like what I am about to say perhaps he will require a minute from Mr McDonald varying Mr McDonald's statement of what the Minister has said. In Mr McDonald's minute to the Secretary dated 2 December he says, in the final paragraph in which he refers to discussions he had had with the Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then had a short general discussion about our respective recollections of the meeting and the Minister commented that I may be called upon to repeat my recollection to one of the inquiries that were in place. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise that now because I think that if there is any failure on the part of the Government to dispel the clear suspicions which now exist about the whole handling of this matter, and if the Minister defies convention by refusing to resign, it may well be that the Minister's statement to Mr McDonald is one that we should heed-that is, this matter should be dealt with by one of the many inquiries into the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, whether it is the parliamentary inquiry or some other inquiry. We cannot have the continuing situation which we have faced day after day, week after week, in this place in which we cannot rely upon information given to the Parliament with respect to the operations of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two matters now which, on the face of the evidence given to the Parliament, we have been forced to send to the Standing Committee on Privileges. In other words, on the face of it it would appear that the Government and its instrumentalities, through the Government's agents, its public servants, have not been able to give us accurate information on these matters which are of so much concern to the Senate. This is a most serious challenge to the capacity of the Parliament to do its duty both with respect to the legislation that is before it-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation-and with respect to the extraordinarily large sums of money that have been allocated for expenditure by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of the documentation which the Government keeps producing in response to the demands of the Senate and in response to the questioning of honourable senators on this side of the chamber who are concerned to see this matter cleaned up-Senator Tambling, Senator Short, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Boswell, Senator Crichton-Browne and many other honourable senators have been pursuing this matter-on too many occasions the results of our inquiries have been lies and inaccuracies. In those circumstances we believe that the Minister has totally failed to live up to his responsibilities and that he should not hold office. We cannot debate this matter in a full and final way because as a group we have not had a chance to peruse carefully the further papers which have just come to hand. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak on this matter now because it is apparent that the Ministers who are dealing with this matter are not taking the trouble to examine the material before it is brought into this place and do their duty as Ministers of the Crown to try to ensure that the Senate is properly informed. Last Thursday Minister Tate, a man who was dean of a law school and who we are assured by his colleagues is a man of the highest reputation and capacity, tabled in this place a document which was, on the face of it, doctored. That was a case of gross and easily avoidable negligence. </PARA>

That is something that no doubt we will be enlightened on before this matter runs its course. Today, Minister Bolkus came in here and made statements in defence of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. Senator Bolkus has tabled documents which again, on their face, raise serious doubts about the accuracy of the assurance that he has given on behalf of Minister Hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a serious matter. It is not just a matter of a principal and agent relationship between the Ministers in this place and Ministers in the other place. The Ministers in this place have a duty, as senators, to exercise their judgment. Senator Bolkus, I understand, is legally qualified. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong. He is not a person, allegedly, without the training to enable him to encompass what is contained in written documents and to determine what value should be placed on them. I ask how Senator Bolkus can come in here and give us the sort of assurances that he has-assurances that the Minister did not mislead; assurances that there was no agreement arising from the discussions of August-and contemporaneously table this letter of 1 September. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we see gross neglect. I do not know whether it is sloth or a lack of concern, but the fact is that Ministers in this place, together with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, stand condemned for their pathetic failure to do their duty as Ministers and to ensure that we get accurate, factual material before us so that we can consider these matters. I think that the Government has to be on notice that the Opposition will not tolerate the slack approach which has been adopted by both the Ministers that we have dealt with over the last two sitting days in the Senate. I think it is pathetic, and I ask Minister Bolkus to ensure that, before he answers the various questions that were put to him in Question Time today, which he undertook to answer as soon as possible, he understands that it is his responsibility to get accurate answers and not just to feed up the pap which comes, whether by negligence or design, and which then has to be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister also: will he consider a couple of questions which, because of the filibustering of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), were not able to be asked today-the question which was to be asked by Senator Short and the question which I was to ask on the same area? I put the Minister on notice that we will be seeking answers to these questions not later than tomorrow. I ask: has he noted the reference in the tabled handwritten note dated 18 October from Ms Glenda Humes, which I have quoted from already in this debate, that Ms Harriet Swift from the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had advised:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is some concern about the precise amount needed and that 2 staff positions (TAP funded by DEET)-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Department of Employment, Education and Training-</PARA>
<PARA>needed to be sorted out eg how long would they be funded under DEET. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister agree that in discussing only the level of funding, not whether NAIHO was to be funded, Ms Swift effectively confirmed the accuracy of the various minutes from Mr Don McDonald about the Minister's decision to fund that organisation, despite his assertion three weeks later that no such decision had been made? I further ask the Minister: Does he agree that minutes by Mr Don McDonald of 1 September, 15 September, 22 September and 13 October this year-not one minute from the hapless Mr McDonald, but minutes from 1 September, 15 September, 22 September and 13 October-plus the minutes of the senior officers meeting of 5 September, plus a note from Ms Glenda Humes dated 18 October to which I have already referred, all accepted the fact that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had approved funding for NAIHO and that the only question remaining was the precise level of such funding? I add to that question, which is the question I was going to ask before I received these tabled documents: Does not that letter from NAIHO of 1 September also make it absolutely clear that the only question remaining was the precise level of such funding?</PARA>

It states that it was not $180,000, it was $193,000, and it wants another $5,000 to round it off to $198,000, which no doubt could be rounded off to $200,000. I further ask the Minister: If it is alleged that such a decision had not been taken, was there no action to challenge or correct the six separate documents before the alleged meeting of 8 November 1988?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put those questions to the Minister and ask him, as a trained lawyer, as a person who has sworn certain oaths with respect to his duties as a Minister and as a senator, to consider those matters and the quite extraordinary circumstance that minute after minute, letter after letter can be written confirming the existence of an agreement and that it is only when Mr Roger Shipton raises the matter in the House of Representatives that we get this revision of history. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something inherently improbable in the matters which the Minister is putting forward. The reason I labour this point is that it is not for Minister Tate or Minister Bolkus to escape responsibility for inaccuracies, misrepresentations and even lies which they may transmit to this place and merely use the defence: `That is what I have been told'. That is not good enough. We are asking the Ministers of this Government to understand that they are responsible for the hundreds of millions of dollars which are being maladministered. Senator Crichton-Browne has talked of thousands of programs which are not being subject to any proper accounting. This is totally unsatisfactory. If Minister Bolkus brings more papers into this place and makes statements which are inconsistent with those papers, he need not think that it will be only Mr Gerry Hand's resignation which we will be seeking; it will be his as well. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of Labor's economic and social policies which have increased the burdens on all Australian families and the need for the Government to adopt policies which provide incentive for individuals, strengthen the family and encourage the growth of private enterprise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We bring this forward as a matter of urgency within 24 hours of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, publishing a major document which indicates that there is a need for new directions in Australia; that we need to re-examine the direction in which Australia is being taken; and that, as Mr Howard said, it is time for some plain thinking. I do not think one could have got a better indication of why it is an urgent matter that the Senate consider this than the answer which was given in the Senate today by Senator Walsh, who as usual used the Senate's time not to consider the matters which are of concern to the men and women of Australia but simply to indulge in an orgy of backward looking abuse of the previous Government, to attack the Opposition, with no sense of concern for the failures of the present Government, and to indulge in the usual self-praise which is such a feature of the Hawke Government-we cannot hear a Minister speak without him telling us how good he and his colleagues are-and which, in a sense, was typical of the arrogant and out of touch approach of this Government to the things that are concerning the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in this debate I and my colleagues wish to concentrate upon the fact that the men and women of Australia have suffered considerable hardship under this Government; whilst we will be dealing with various details of that and the reasons why there has been such a revolt against the Australian Labor Party in electorates around Australia; and whilst my colleague Senator Puplick will be addressing the extraordinary and cynical claims of the Government with respect to easing the plight of children in poverty and its total failure to come to grips with the real issues in that area, the fact of the matter is that this debate not only could focus on those microconcerns-the concerns of the individual-but could just as easily focus on the total failure of this Government to come to grips with the problems of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about that a little, because the two things are closely interrelated. We cannot improve the lot of the people of Australia if the Australian economy is not going in the right direction. We cannot increase living standards unless we increase productivity in the economy generally. The truth of the matter is that the approach of this Government has put it beyond its capacity to deliver what the people of Australia want-which is a better direction and a better life for themselves. When one listens to the smugness of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the complacency of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and the vitriol of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), one could almost imagine that the Australian economy is an economy in a strong position and proceeding in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a couple of things about why it is that the people of Australia are feeling this extraordinary pressure under this present Government; why it is that the burdens on Australian families have been so increased. The fact is that the crisis that we have had in Australia in 1986, the crisis that was acknowledged even by Mr Keating when he talked about Australia becoming a banana republic, the crisis that we were having to buy from abroad so much more than we were making in Australia and selling abroad, is a crisis which has got worse instead of better. The fact is that the complacency of this Government, and, indeed, the complacency of some of the big businesses in this country is underpinned by one factor only; that is, the increase in the prices that we get for our commodities. During 1985 and 1986 Treasurer Keating-would be Prime Minister Keating-talked of nothing else but the declining terms of trade which were causing such hardship in Australia. Since 1986 we have fully recovered those dramatic losses of the previous years. Our terms of trade are now as good as they have been since the mid-1970s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters interjects that wool is higher. So many of our commodities are better. The truth is that our balance of payments position has slightly improved solely because of that change in the prices we get for our Australian commodities. If one were to look at the actual physical trade in goods and services, one would find that each year since 1986 our trade has worsened. The gap between what we buy and what we sell is bigger today than it was in 1986. In those circumstances Australia is in a very perilous condition indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, when one looks at our economic prospects, one finds that our inflation rate is nearly twice as high as that of our trading partners generally. Our wage rises go up two or three times as fast but, of course, our employees, our workers, our wage and salary earners, do not benefit from those big increases in wages because the sad fact is that inflation outstrips those rises. Our inflation rate is so much higher than the rest of the world. Our interest rates are at 15 per cent while those of the United States are at 10 per cent and those of most other countries are much lower. Our tax rates are uncompetitive, our productivity is stagnant, declining in many areas, and overall, is about half the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rate. We have a high foreign debt which continues to climb. Last week we heard very little from Minister Walsh and Treasurer Keating about the fact that our foreign debt had reached $120 billion-a fantastic figure for Australia to service and a very good indication of just how much trouble we are in. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not in those macro-terms that the problem is considered by the voters and the people of Australia. The reality that they face is a decline in their living standards under Labor for a whole series of reasons. This Government simply refuses to address the reality that faces middle income earners in this country. This Government has treated middle income earners with contempt; it has treated, in particular, families with dependants with contempt. The people who have felt the squeeze the greatest under Labor are those who are bringing up children, buying a home, and doing the things which are essential to the maintenance of our society. When I raise this with Labor people and Labor audiences, they say that I am talking about a minority. They wipe off the concern of the Liberal and National parties of people marrying, having children and playing their part in continuing our society and ensuring its continued health-that part of the life of nearly every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the key factors which have affected and now affect individuals under this Government. Look at the central interests of Australians in owning a home, in having decent accommodation. If one chooses, as the Government might like to do, to start with those Australians who are least well off, the Australians who cannot afford to buy a house-because of Labor's policies there is an increasing proportion of those in our community-one asks: How have the people who cannot afford to buy a house fared under Labor? The sad fact is that when this Government came into office in 1983 there were 100,000 Australians on the welfare housing list-100,000 Australians could not get public accommodation although they qualified for it. Now, after 5 1/2 years of Labor Government, 160,000 Australians are on those waiting lists. Those people who were most in need of government assistance have seen a 60 per cent worsening of their position under the Labor Government-a splendid achievement! I note that not one Labor Minister is prepared to debate these issues. I have no doubt that the Labor speakers will express their pride in increasing the number of people on waiting lists for welfare housing by 60 per cent!</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of that majority of Australians who have an ambition to purchase their own home, the simple fact is that the income required to buy an average priced first home has doubled since Labor came to power. In fact it has doubled since early 1985. In 1985, if a family were earning $23,000 a year it could afford to buy an average-priced first home. In 1987 a family is required to have an income of $46,000 a year. That is what this splendid Government has achieved for the people of Australia over a period of three years-a doubling of the income required to purchase a house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell says that the Labor Government is supposed to represent the workers. Yet average home loan repayments have gone from $350 a month in March 1983 to $711 a month in June 1988. However one looks at it, whether it be at the interests of middle Australians, that broad spectrum of Australia that believe that to buy and own a home is a central part of living the sort of life that they wish to lead, we see this doubling of the burden which has been imposed during the period of this Labor Government. That is one area of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the tax burden. One of the reasons that we have a problem in respect of the declining living standards in this country is that people are called upon to pay a higher and higher proportion of their incomes in tax. Again, this is the Government which is supposed to be concerned with the people of Australia. On 1 July this year, the Government introduced a 10c reduction in the rate of company tax. It went from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar. The wage and salary earners of this country, who have been paying an increasing proportion of their incomes in income tax year by year-each year a little more of their income is taken by the Commonwealth in income taxes-were told by this Government that they would have to wait until the next financial year, until just before an election, before they were entitled to have any form of tax relief. That is the approach of this Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chapman reminds me that it is just before it goes out of office. That is absolutely right. The sad fact is the wage and salary earners must continue to bear this pain. In fact, it is a pain which will worsen as bracket creep worsens between now and the next financial year. Yet the Government, in pursuit of its failed economic policies as it happens, can hand out an earlier tax cut to business. The marginal tax rate is now higher than it was when Labor came to office; the average tax rate is now higher than it was when Labor came to office; and the tax share of our gross domestic product (GDP) is now at a record high. The Prime Minister, in his airy fairy way, promised a few years ago that the Government would not take an increased proportion of the GDP in tax. What has he done? He has increased the proportion of what we produce that has gone in tax. Once again, we cannot take any notice of what Mr Hawke says. His statements are utterly unreliable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Take health care which is of concern to the people of Australia. Health costs are going up at about twice the inflation rate. Taxpayers pay a compulsory Medicare levy. Again, the poorest in the community are suffering the most. We find lengthy public hospital queues. We find that that 18 per cent of people who had private insurance can no longer afford it. They therefore have to become a further burden on the public hospital system. The Government is squeezing not the middle class, not the better off in this community, but it is squeezing out the poor. This Government has taken 18 per cent of people out of private insurance because it has made it much more costly to privately insure health. It has ensured that people pay twice for their health care if they insure privately. Once again, it is not just that 18 per cent of people who have found that they can no longer afford to insure who are damaged; it is also those people who are poorest in the community. And the pensioner community, who are almost totally reliant upon public health care, can wait two years for a hip operation. I say to Senator Cook that that is a brilliant success. Although Senator Cook's responsibilities are not in aged care, he might talk to his colleagues about the pride they no doubt feel in holding up pensioner operations in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to family assistance. This issue will be dealt with in much more detail by Senator Puplick. I remind the Senate of what the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) identified so clearly and what we have been talking about ever since the Government put its total emphasis on the family allowance supplement: this Government has made it tougher for all families with children except the bottom 20 per cent. Every other family has seen its position worsened under Labor. As identified very clearly by EPAC in its report entitled Income Support Policies, Taxation and Incentives, Australians on incomes varying between about 60 per cent and 90 per cent of average weekly earnings-in other words, the great bulk of hard working families on relatively modest incomes-pay marginal tax rates of sometimes over 100 per cent. By focusing assistance on income tested programs, by removing assistance under the family allowance supplement, the family allowance itself, the Medicare levy, and so on, the Government actually produces tax rates on people who have incomes of around $300 a week in excess of 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That is this Government's extraordinary achievement-to lock low income families into poverty and to treat all but low income families with absolute contempt and to refuse to extend them any assistance at all during the last 5 1/2 difficult years. Family allowance has been removed from people on higher incomes; people on middle incomes have received no increase at all either in their family allowance or their dependent spouse tax rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what has been done for the workers, this Government is a gigantic confidence trick. In Senator Cook's State of Western Australia there was a 23 per cent swing in the electorate of ex-Premier Burke and a 15 per cent swing in the electorate of the ex-Deputy Premier. That vote adequately reflected the understanding in the community that it has been treated with contempt by this Government which hobnobs with the rich and powerful and does not give a damn for the middle income people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, John Howard made it quite clear that the directions which are required to be set by this country are utterly different. John Howard made the point that we would be guided in the next government by five key principles. They are the strengthening of the family, restoring Australians' control over their own lives, providing more incentive and choice, ensuring a fair go for all, and building one Australia. I do not have time in this debate to go into the whole of the detail of what has been put forward by John Howard on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, but whatever aspect of government policy we look at, those principles need to be applied. Let me take tax policy. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) would like to interrupt me, but I will not be interrupted because if we note what has happened in the tax system under Labor, we find that the increased tax burden which is being borne by all Australians is borne most heavily by families with dependants. In other words, those who are most vulnerable pay the most. I remind the Senate that the tax policies put forward by the Liberal and National parties, both in 1984 and in 1987, made it quite clear that our tax policy will discriminate in favour of Australians who are meeting their responsibilities to their dependants. I mark that as one of the key areas which mark us off from Labor. Labor has made the tax system more burdensome for families with dependants and for individuals with dependants, and it has made the tax system comparatively easier for those who are not meeting their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> As to building one Australia, there is another fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government. The Opposition will ensure that all sectors of the Australian community are treated equally. I want to say two things about that. The first is that to any of us who come from Western Australia it has been glaringly obvious that the Labor Party stands for a better deal for its friends than for the community generally. One of the extraordinary changes that have been achieved in Western Australia under five years of Labor rule, principally under Premier Burke but now under Premier Dowding, is that there is no longer equal treatment of the people. The fact is that if one is part of the inner circle, if one is part of the select coterie, a better deal is available. One of the things that the Liberal and National parties stand for, both in Western Australia and nationally, is equal treatment. We will ensure that that is brought about. It is long overdue. </PARA>

I will not be drowned out. I will put the Government's case. I will show that this motion contains a series of platitudes. It would be no surprise to anyone that I oppose a motion which starts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The failure of Labor's economic and social policies which have increased the burden on all Australian families . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Assertions have been made by the Opposition this afternoon. It is very easy for the Oppositions to make assertions about the Hawke Government's alleged inactivity in relation to the Australian economy and to say that this inactivity affects Australian families. It is another matter to prove that these assertions are correct. I claim that the Opposition is on thin ice when it speaks of Labor's failure with its economic and social policies. Indeed, there is a sharp and marked contrast when one looks at the woeful record of the previous Liberal-National Government-I refer, of course, to the Fraser Government-and when one compares that record with what Labor has done to rectify the situation since it became the Government in March 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Chaney was addressing the Senate, an Opposition senator asked a Minister across the chamber what he had ever done for the workers. The Minister retorted, `We've given the workers jobs'. This is very important for all Australian families. If we are to strengthen families, surely one of the major concerns is employment. When a family's breadwinner is unemployed, the quality of family life is diminished. Not only is it diminished in an economic sense but also a family's social life becomes limited. Instead of enjoying life, some family members are overcome by despair. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background it is pertinent to examine the job creation records of the Hawke Government and the Fraser Government. In the period from 1983, when the Hawke Government came to office, to now, 1,179,700-almost 1.2 million-jobs have been created. This is a massive number, and it does not occur unless the Federal Government has taken positive steps to create an economic climate which is conducive to job creation. The Hawke Government has done just that. I remember the parlous situation in Australia when we came into government in 1983 in terms of jobs for ordinary people-family members. In the 12 months prior to our coming into government, the situation had became worse and worse. We as a government had the trust placed in us to provide jobs for Australian people. That trust has not been misplaced. We went about that matter with vigour and we have provided those jobs. As Senator Cook said in response to an interjection, we have helped the families of Australian by providing them with jobs. That is a major area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that nearly 1.2 million jobs have been created since this Government came to power. Perhaps it is difficult to visualise what an increase of a million jobs means. Let us look at the Fraser Government's record. From November 1975 to March 1983, which is longer than the period of the Hawke Government, 334,200 jobs were created. Putting it another way, in a shorter time than the Fraser Government had at its disposal, Labor has provided three times as many jobs. I repeat: from 1975 to 1983, 334,000 jobs were created and, in less time than that, the Hawke Government has created almost 1.2 million jobs. If one compares the last 5 1/2 years of the Fraser Government with the 5 1/2 years of the current Hawke Government, the contrast is even more marked. In their last 5 1/2 years the Liberals and Nationals as a government created 242,500 jobs-less than one-quarter of the greater than one million jobs created under Labor's first 5 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask what all this has to do with the alleged matter of urgency which has been proposed by the Opposition. It has a great deal to do with it. Employment is of vital importance to Australian families. It is often easy to underestimate the number of people who are affected by changes to employment patterns. The one million-plus jobs created under the Hawke Government's economic policies directly affect just over three million people-those who have the jobs and members of their immediate families who are dependent on them. So we are not just looking at the one million who have jobs; we are looking at about three million in the community who have been affected. Many people who have jobs now would not have had them had the previous Government's policies been followed. One may ask how many families had joy in the last 12 months of the Fraser Government. Many did not. In that period of the Fraser Administration there was no increase in the number of jobs available in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. It is necessary for me to use copious notes because I do not keep figures in my head as Senator Walsh does. I can use the figures just as effectively, but I need to have them in front of me. I was saying that during the last 12 months of the Fraser Administration there was no increase in the number of jobs available in Australia. Actually, the situation was even worse than that. During the last 12 months of the Fraser Administration the number of employment positions in Australia fell: 186,900 jobs vanished. Again, the number of people affected by the loss of those 186,900 jobs was greater than that. Half a million people-those who lost their jobs and members of their families-were affected directly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I look at the Fraser Government's dismal record and the Hawke Government's positive record on job creation, I am reminded of an educational report entitled Promise and Performance. I am not quite sure whether Senator Boswell was in Queensland during his primary school days-he was probably in Western Australia-but if he had been in Queensland he might have heard of the report Promise and Performance. The report was based on a longitudinal study of students who had shown promise, as measured by academic achievement, in their final year of primary school in Queensland and whether their performance in later years matched their earlier promise. Those who are listening in Queensland and are of my vintage may remember that we used to have an examination called the scholarship examination. Based on the 1951 scholarship examination, the promise of various students was measured and their performance was measured later. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Opposition may be full of promise when it talks about future directions but, given the unlikely event of a coalition victory at the next Federal election, how would that promise be backed up by performance? I expect that the performance would be dismal. One has only to look at the previous record of the Liberals and Nationals to see that. As I have outlined, that record was, to put it quite mildly, dismal. Just as past performance is a good indicator of future performance in many fields, so too is it in government. There is every reason to expect that the employment record of a future Liberal-National government would be equally dismal. </PARA>
<PARA> Before leaving the issue of employment, which is of vital importance to Australian families, I mention that between 170,000 and 200,000 jobs have to be created each year in Australia just to accommodate those persons entering or re-entering the work force. Labor has done far better than that. It has been able not only to accommodate these persons but also to create extra jobs. When the Hawke Government gained office in March 1983, 9.9 per cent of the work force was unemployed. Under the Hawke Government's policies, this figure has dropped to 6.9 per cent. I would like to see unemployment drop far lower than that. There is still room for improvement, but the statistics show that Labor is heading in the right direction. Unlike the Liberal Party of Australia, Labor does not have to conduct a weekend function to try to convince its Party faithful that everything now is all sweetness and light. We are moving in the right direction and the people of Australia who have jobs because of our policies are well aware of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is well aware that, without adequate educational opportunities being made available to our young people, employment prospects could be stunted. Not only do we have to look at our employment record, we have to look at our record of providing educational opportunities for the young people of this country. To this effect, the Hawke Government has been actively pursuing a policy of encouraging more students to stay at school longer. It is not satisfactory for students to leave school early in the hope of finding unskilled employment. Such employment is not nearly as plentiful as it was. In the past, young males often went into the same calling as their fathers, and that calling may have been an unskilled job. They cannot do that now, because such unskilled jobs are not available in the same quantities as they were. It is necessary for young people to gain more skills at school before they actually seek jobs. Jobs are available in Australia, but job seekers require skills and, sometimes, highly developed skills. By encouraging students to stay at school longer, we will have a much better-educated work force, which will allow us to compete with overseas countries and thus increase the prosperity of the nation as well as the workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what we are attempting to do with our educational policies. We are trying to get young people to stay at school longer; to develop the skills they need so that they can have jobs which will improve their quality of life and that of their families and enable them to make a contribution to Australia. We are encouraging young people to stay longer at school, but this is often not enough. Low income families, unless they receive some financial assistance, find it hard to contemplate sending their youngsters to school when the young people could leave school, have an unskilled job, or draw an unemployment benefit. It is unfortunate that in times gone past, the children of low income families have not been able to take advantage of higher education or even education beyond the year 10 level for the final two years of secondary school. It has been necessary for them to go out into the work force, take an unskilled job and unfortunately remain unskilled for the rest of their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Hawke Government introduced Austudy, which has been made available not only to tertiary students-as was the case under the old scheme-but also to full time secondary students. I am a little concerned that some low income families are not aware that their sons or daughters, once they reach the age of 16, can receive this benefit to stay at school. In 1989, a 16- or 17-year-old student, living at home, will be able to receive a maximum rate of $53.55 a week, subject to an income asset test, which I will mention in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher rates will be available for older students and for those living away from home. These payments which are of extreme assistance to those students and their families, are income and assets tested, thus ensuring that the benefits are provided to families in need. If students from these families can, with Austudy assistance, gain greater skills and thus a more financially rewarding job, surely the whole family will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Some scant mention was made of the family allowance supplement which was introduced by the Hawke Government. This supplement was introduced because we, as a government, could see that some of the most needy families in Australia were not necessarily those on some benefit or pension, but those who were bringing into the home a fairly low weekly wage. The family allowance supplement provides people on a low wage with extra assistance for their children. This tax-free supplement is on top of the family allowance money which people already receive. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have been helped by the family allowance supplement. For instance, a family with one child and an income of $300 a week or less can receive a supplement of $22. This amount will be increased early in the new year. Increased amounts are paid when the child reaches 13, 14 or 15 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> We had some difficulty, when introducing this scheme, in contacting all of those people who would be eligible. This is not an easy group to contact. However, many people are now benefiting from the family allowance supplement, which we have introduced, as a result of the great efforts that have been made to contact them. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the urgency motion that has been moved this afternoon by the Opposition. The Hawke Government has looked after families in Australia. The Hawke Government has positive policies and the Hawke Government will be returned at the next election because the people of Australia definitely know what the Hawke Government is doing for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I read in this morning's newspapers that Mr Howard was going to rely on unrestrained personal greed in a fully deregulated market to get us back to the good old days, I wondered whether the private enterprise displayed by the Bond Corporation, for instance, which had a tax liability of only one per cent this year, needed more incentive. Again in this morning's newspapers we saw that incentivation and free market forces had combined to break the one per cent barrier. I am sure that the Opposition parties and the Government are pleased with themselves. I, like others, read that three corporate taxpayers, Qintex Ltd, Adsteam and Equiticorp Australia Ltd paid tax at the levels of 0.11, 0.43 and 0.8 per cent of their gross earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By comparison, the tax burden on pay as you earn taxpayers has increased steadily, taking in a greater proportion of the family's income. The Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) has documented the fact that a single parent in public housing can face an equivalent marginal tax rate in excess of 140 per cent, a classic poverty trap. Yet after the 1986-87 Budget, the Liberal and National parties, which have brought us this urgency motion today, voted with the Government to delay by six months legislation designed to ease poverty traps of a similar nature, making pensioners wait for their cost of living adjustments for another six weeks. That delay is still in operation, at the expense of Australia's pensioners. The same Opposition brings us this urgency motion today, slamming the Government, whose actions it has supported, and pushing its own barrow. The Opposition is firing its first parliamentary shot in the salvo launched yesterday by its Leader, John Howard, its `back to basics' campaign. An article in the Australian Financial Review this morning was headed `Opposition woos the family'. The Age this morning pointed to the family and family values being the cornerstone of this `back to basics' push. But the Age editorial this morning asked the crucial question, which is also raised by this motion. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Howard speaks of supporting the family, what sort of family does he mean? Do single parents, de facto couples or homosexual relationships qualify?</PARA>
<PARA>I could ask whether my father-in-law qualifies. He is a single, elderly person living in a retirement village. I could ask whether my mother qualifies. She lives in a non-nuclear family with my sister and her family. We should consider the question, `What is a family?'. I refer honourable senators to the social justice statement of the Anglican Church of Australia put out in 1986, to which I have previously referred in this place. It points out that everyone belongs to a family, or has belonged to a family at some stage during life, that it is not easy to define what `family' means in modern society, and that there are many variations. It suggests that one general definition of a family is `one or two adults living with one or more dependent children'. An even simpler definition is `where kids live'. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>In determining a christian view of the family, it is important not to suggest that there is a functionally optimal family . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that Opposition senators are listening to this. The Age this morning, quoting the Liberal and National parties' document Future Directions, under the heading `The Family', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although government should not penalise alternative lifestyles, it has a responsibility to ensure that the family unit has the legal, financial and social support necessary to sustain it. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the Opposition look very closely at the exhortation by the Anglican Church that we should not assume that one type of family is functionally optimal as opposed to other types of families, or there will be rank discrimination, as I suspect there will be in any case. The Anglican Church's social justice statement goes on to say that the church has a habit of speaking of the ideal family. The Future Directions statement does just that. It also has on its front cover a picture of such a family. The Anglican Church's statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we need to approach family life as it is actually experienced. There are external pressures on it in Australia today: unemployment, poor nutrition, homelessness, emotional and physical violence, work demands and poverty. There are internal pressures: violence, incest, child abuse and immature relationships. Then there is the place of family in its immediate neighbourhood: whether the community gives support to or ignores vulnerable families, and provides services for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The family is the most economic way for people to live, from the government's point of view, because resources are shared voluntarily and at almost no cost to the State. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on to suggest that that is why universal payments to all families with dependent children are desirable, a sentiment which I support. The statement points out that families transfer wealth among themselves and between generations and provide great opportunities for each other in terms of skill development. Dr Don Edgar, of the Institute of Family Studies, points out that the family remains the most central unit of social interaction and economic exchange in people's lives. He also points to the fact that unemployment affects family life, not just the economy. He goes on to say that the family is the major socialising agent of society, the `crucible of competence' in society. So we must look at the family in the broadest possible way. I doubt from the evidence thus far whether that is what the Opposition is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 26.2 per cent of the total population lives in families of two parents with dependent children under the age of 15, the sort of family pictured over the shoulder of John Howard yesterday as he delivered his Future Directions statement. What about the rest of Australia? I refer to the Background Discussion paper No. 23 of the Social Security Review. It examines types of families with dependent children, which is a subset of all families in the first place, assuming that those dependent children are under 16 years of age. Only 37 per cent of all families with dependent children-which leaves out single parent families and family groupings of elderly people who no longer have dependent children-are two-parent families with one parent employed; 41 per cent are two-parent families with both parents employed at least part-time; 15 per cent are single adult families, and 7 per cent are two-parent families with both parents unemployed. There is not a lot of uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do not argue with the concept of the importance of family life. But, as Dr Don Edgar points out, a great deal is wrong with our system, with policies and their implementation, which indicates a failure to understand all of the influences on the structure of family life. He says that structural changes in family life must be understood if child poverty is to be eradicated. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have included the downward fertility rate as a result of differing attitudes to having children and to changes in contraception availability; the changing role of women, which has economic and social consequences and which still enshrines a great deal of economic inequity as far as women are concerned; the social and economic costs from the breakdown of marriage; the rigidity in education and training, which limits employment opportunities, particularly for women, and is at the expense of access and flexibility for people to get into the work force; and the attitude to child care-that it is too costly, we cannot afford it and therefore we cannot provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at some important current facts about family life. Last year's figures showed that 55 per cent of female-headed sole parent families lived in poverty, 19 per cent of married couple families with three or more children lived in poverty and 41 per cent of families with four or more children lived in poverty. There is also the alarming estimate that one in five Australian children-that is, nearly 820,000-are growing up in a family with an income below the Henderson poverty line. That is probably an underestimate of the extent of child poverty because, although we have certainty of the numbers of children reliant on social security income, we do not have a definitive measure of the number of children living in families earning a low wage or with self-employed parents. Since we must be talking about all families, that must be of major concern. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent publication of the Australian Council of Social Service contained a summary of Alison McClelland's paper to the ACOSS National Congress, which points out that according to the August 1987 figures 1.4 million people have wage and salary earnings of less than $240 per week and low wage earners are likely to be women, juniors, part-time or part year workers, clustered in certain industries-the wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, community services, finance, property and business services. It also cited figures within some families. Fifty-six per cent of income units containing a low wage earner had total combined incomes of less than $20,900 a year. Twenty-five per cent of parents of young low wage earners living at home had combined incomes of less than $15,500. Fifteen per cent of income units containing a low wage earner were below the poverty line. These are figures of families whose needs must be addressed by coalition policy as well as by government policy; we must not forget this. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I referred earlier to poverty traps surrounding people on pensions and benefits. The recent EPAC report, Income Support Policies, Taxation and Incentives, pointed out that poverty traps exist also for low wage earners. The family allowance supplement has been lauded here already, and will be further during the debate, but let us not ignore the fact that it has had the effect of increasing the equivalent marginal tax rate for a significant number of low income working families in the range where this payment is being phased out. This is a classical poverty trap. Of course, this is experienced only by families with dependent children. Further, other income tested transfers for taxpayers with dependent children raise their equivalent marginal tax rate, that is, payment such as Austudy, subsidised child care and the like. So it is not all beer and skittles, even if one does have a job and is not on government benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been vast documentation on this, including a very good paper on child poverty, recently presented in Melbourne by Jenny Tretheweyn of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, in which many of the major causes of child poverty have been clearly defined. If we are to do something for families, I suggest that this is a priority. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made that comment in the past. But the question is whether we can meet that priority. These causes are an increase in the rate and duration of unemployment in families with children; the growth in the number of sole parent families; housing costs; the inadequacy of income support for families with children, and the effects of wage restraint on people with low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say a brief word about increased unemployment. This increase has been substantial in the past two decades. While the Government tells us a lot about increased employment under its administration, we must realise that between 1983 and 1988 over one-third of jobs created in Australia were part time. These figures are from the Family Research Bulletin of the Mission of St James and St John. As we know, part time employment does not fill bellies unless it is supplemented somewhere else in the family; it does not come with pro rata benefits; it goes largely to the young and to the female; and it is not adequate. So I challenge the Government's figures there. The trend to unemployment and to this inadequacy will continue as long as the Government and the Opposition parties are prepared to accept a 7 or 8 per cent level of unemployment as an economic necessity and an inevitable component of its deregulated market economy-which attitude has taken the place of Government responsibility to its citizens in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at other aspects of the problems facing families in poverty, in particular families with children, we see that there has been a growth in the number of sole parent families. The Government must do more to support families staying together. I regret that it is not refunding the Family Mediation Centre or any other pilot programs in that area, but instead waiting until things have broken down. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is a major area where families need help. All the Opposition talks about is home ownership. But there are many families, especially sole parent and low income families, who cannot afford that. This Government has not been prepared to put funds into housing. Clearly, the Opposition, from the headlines about its statement yesterday, is not prepared to do that either. There is no question that these are the major issues facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget wage restraint, which has been carried out by wage earners in this society who have not had the benefit from the last round of tax cuts. This wage restraint is impacting on families and particularly children in our society. I will conclude with the words of Don Edgar who said:</PARA>

<PARA> The failure of Labor's economic and social policies which have increased the burdens on all Australian families and the need for the Government to adopt policies which provide incentive for individuals, strengthen the family and encourage the growth of private enterprise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Before my own remarks on that topic, I must spend at least a moment or two referring to the remarks made by the previous speaker, Senator Powell of the Australian Democrats. I do not often speak in this place in support of the Government, because it is very rare that the Government does anything that we can support; but the fact is that the Government at least has some responsibilities because it is the Government. The Government does not actually acquit its responsibilities very well, but it does have some responsibilities and from time to time it acknowledges that it has those responsibilities, just as we on this side of the chamber know that, after the next election, we will have those responsibilities and we will acquit them. But the party represented by the honourable senator who has just sat down has no responsibilities. </PARA>

That is why they feel the freedom to come into this place and to roam all around the ridges of this country talking the sort of stuff that we have heard today from Senator Powell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is because of the adoption in this country over years of the kind of populist rhetoric that we have just heard from Senator Powell that we are in the mess that we are in. It is because of the acceptance of a policy of spending money as though it is going out of fashion that we are in the kind of mess that we are in. That is what produced the mess about which Senator Powell is now so hypocritically complaining. Let us not have any more of that stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that I speak today for every National Party of Australia senator in this place when I say that, in the next 12 months or however long it may be until the Government finally calls an election, we will support the kinds of policies which were announced yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, and the Leader of my Party, Mr Ian Sinclair, in Parramatta and we will state the values for which people in these two coalition parties stand. </PARA>
<PARA> In his remarks opening this debate, Senator Chaney has already referred to the result, so far as the living standards of Australians are concerned, of 5 1/2 years of Labor government. This result-he was probably too polite to say this but I will say it-has been reflected in every Federal by-election this year. It has been reflected in the Adelaide by-election, which was lost by the Australian Labor Party, with an enormous swing against it. It has been reflected in the Port Adelaide by-election, which was barely retained by the Labor Party, with another major swing against it. It was reflected again in the seat of Oxley with a major swing against the Labor Party of nearly 12 per cent. It was the only seat to survive in the 1975 election in Queensland for Labor and it was almost lost on this occasion. That is what the people of Australia are saying about the policies-to use the words of the motion, the failure of Labor's economic and social policies which have increased the burdens on them. It is against those burdens which those people in those by-elections were protesting, and they voted in the most effective way by putting the appropriate votes in the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to them, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if they think what we have so far got has been bad and is bad, there is almost certainly worse to come. The truth is that for the past two years the Australian people have been conned by this Government into thinking that the worst is over. The worst is not over; the worst is yet to come. Whether it comes within the life of the present Government will depend on how quickly this Government scampers off to yet another early election and how quickly the threats to Australia's economy, which are still only external threats at the moment, come to pass. Why do I say that? The facts and the statistics speak for themselves. Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics issued figures for foreign indebtedness of Australians as at 30 September last. Those figures show that at that date our gross foreign debt-that is, the debts to foreigners of all Australians, including governments, corporations and individuals-amounted to $120.4 billion. That was an increase of $4.2 billion over those three months alone and an increase of $12.2 billion over the previous 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> If others prefer to employ figures for net debt-that is, after subtracting those small debts which foreigners owe to Australians and also after subtracting the gold and foreign exchange international reserves of our central bank-then the net debt of all Australians at 30 September last was $93.3 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion over the three months ended at that time. It was an increase of $10.9 billion over the 12 months. At that time that net debt was equivalent to just over 30 per cent of our domestic product. That compares with an equivalent percentage of just under 10 per cent when this Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious to all honourable senators that the reason we have acquired that enormous net indebtedness to foreigners is that throughout the whole period of this Government being in office we have been running the most enormous deficits on the current account of our balance of payments. Those deficits can be paid for only in one of two ways: either by borrowings from foreigners or by selling off Australia's assets to foreigners. Again, the record, which is still running for this Government in the balance of payments area, is parlous. At the time of the Budget the Treasurer (Mr Keating) estimated that we would have a deficit of $9.5 billion this year. We had a deficit of $5.4 billion in the first four months. The Treasurer is not releasing a revised estimate but he is making it plain that his Budget estimate is now totally out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> The truly worrying aspect of this position of our balance of payments and of our foreign debt is that this has been occurring, and is still occurring, at a time when our export prices are as good as they have been for many years and our international terms of trade are better than they have been for a decade. In issuing the national account figures last week, the Statistician specifically said, `The terms of trade index is now at its highest since the June quarter of 1977'. In other words, with our international terms of trade now at their highest level for over a decade, we are in the process of recording a deficit on our external accounts for this financial year which could range somewhere between, I suspect, $11 billion and $12 billion. </PARA>

<PARA> The matter does not stop there. I hasten to add that it is not just a matter of these rather dry economic statistics. It is not just a matter of economists' jargon. Above all, it is not a matter of mere politics, although this is a chamber for politics. As Senator Chaney has already pointed out, it is a matter which affects the everyday lives of the ordinary men and women of Australia. As Senator Puplick, who will follow me from our side of the chamber, will, I think, say in his remarks about family assistance, it is a matter which vitally affects that area of public policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will not be there for a long time; he is not used to opposition. As I said, things have gone wrong. Mr Keating's cart has run off the track; the wheels have fallen off. The Budget has not done the trick. That huge surplus was supposed to produce `downward pressure on interest rates'-and I am quoting from the Budget Speech. Interest rates have been rising ever since two days after the Budget Speech. And they are still rising. Indeed short term interest rates are now just over two full percentage points higher than they were when the Budget was brought down. What we have now is an economy which is sucking in imports at a tremendous rate. The Government is going to apply a short, sharp shock to it. Do honourable senators remember that discredited phrase which used to be applied to the policies of previous governments by honourable senators now sitting on the Government side of the chamber? Do they remember the phrase `short, sharp shock'? That is what Mr Keating is now in the process of applying to the economy-or a short, sharp squeeze, by way of very high interest rates. The point is that it will not be short, although it certainly will be sharp. Indeed, I can already see that sharpness reflected in the most recent figures for private dwelling approvals, which were down by, I think, 8 1/2 per cent in October in seasonally adjusted terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why are we getting all this from the Government? We are getting it in order to deflate the economy sufficiently by the middle of next year to enable the Government still to go ahead with its promised tax cuts at that time. Therefore, the slightly revised game plan now is to produce a sort of mild recession by the middle of next year in order to make it look as though giving tax cuts at that time, without cutting the Government's own spending, is responsible. That is what we have now. Here we have a government that has been drifting along for nearly two years now, sustained during that time by rising export prices-notwithstanding which our debt continues to mount-and also by the sale of our assets to foreigners at an increasing rate, and which has promised to produce a fistful of dollars from 1 July next year, after which it can have an election. That policy is producing today the equivalent of a credit squeeze in order to depress the economy sufficiently to enable that still to proceed while maintaining some semblance of responsibility as far as the balance of payments is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Every Australian family which has a mortgage will feel this process in the course of the weeks and months ahead because the Government has got it wrong and is unwilling to admit that it has got it wrong.

<PARA>The editorial continued further on:</PARA>
<PARA> The manifesto's fundamental shortcoming is its failure to deal convincingly with the central issue of government: economic management. </PARA>
<PARA>Most significantly, the Financial Review editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, in a thin review of foreign policy, places Australia squarely within `the moral superiority of Western democracy'. Where does this leave Australia's relations with its closest neighbours, mostly neither Western nor Christian? Are they consequently morally inferior?</PARA>
<PARA>This is a perfect example of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP)-like attitude of the Liberal Party at work. Coming from Earlwood, as Mr Howard and I do, I am reminded of all the Greek and Lebanese people, and all the people from other countries, who have made their places in Australia and how offended they will be at the WASP-ish approach of the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA> The ideal home featured as a logo for the programme was described by Mr Howard as `a coalition house'. But it is fundamentally `the House that Jack Howard Built'. It looks handsome, but regrettably, it is built on sand. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the coalition manifesto that this urgency motion is based upon? Stripped of its platitudes, it is the old conservative recipe of disruption and division for the promotion of sectional interests and greed. Shorn of the rhetoric of the nostalgia that I have described-that is what this document is based on and this motion simply attempts to develop it-we have a lot of strange things, such as the attempt to go back to the era of a particular type of family. The fact is that that relegates women to second class status in the work force and the home. The fact is that under this Government 1.1 million jobs have been created and, of those 663,000 or 58 per cent, have gone to women. Half of them have been full time jobs. That is the difference between the period that the Liberal and National parties yearn for and the reality of today. This Government is basing its policies on the real needs of women in the country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have in the Opposition's policy and repeated in the urgency motion is platitudes, propaganda and prejudice. It is a false analysis of the present needs and problems that we have in Australia. It is a blindly false statement as far as solutions are concerned. When Mr Howard was campaigning to depose his predecessor he said that leadership demanded clear, precise and specific policies. Four years on he has produced no leadership and no policies. When Senator Stone, who has just spoken, tried to introduce clear, precise and specific policies, he was relegated to the sin bin. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry I stirred up members of the Opposition when referring to the contribution that this Government has made, particularly in relation to families and women. Towards the end of the Menzies period, the participation rate for women in the labour force was 36 per cent; now it is 50 per cent. We can see the period that the Liberals and the Nationals yearn for. Since we have been in Government, after the seven years of the Fraser Government, we have tried to change society. After all, the present Opposition was in power for 30 of the last 38 years. Since we have been in government we have produced over one million jobs-the real test of providing opportunities for families-in comparison with the Fraser Government, which, in its very last year, relegated a quarter of a million Australians to the scrap heap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing could better illustrate the extent to which the Australian Labor Party is out of touch with the real needs of Australian families, particularly working families, than the speech just given by Senator Childs. He has come in here mewling about his origins in the suburb of Earlwood. What he does not tell the Senate is that, like all good left wing members of the Labor Party, as soon as he was able he shot through from his working class suburb and he now happily resides in the plush surrounds of the electorate of Mackellar. He lives on Scotland Island, where one needs access to a private boat to get to and from one's places of residence-a nice secure environment in which working class men and women could not be found, and certainly would not be found.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Childs comes in here and tells us about the concern that the Labor Party has for people in straitened circumstances and about his great working class background and how terrific Earlwood is. The only thing that unites the Left and Right of the Labor Party in New South Wales is that, just as Senator Childs shot through from Earlwood to the lovely surrounds of Scotland Island, his right wing colleague Senator Richardson shot through from Kogarah to Killara as soon as he could make sure he had the resources to do so. Neither of them would want to be caught dead living in working class suburbs in Sydney-and Senator Childs comes in here to discuss the position of Australian families. Let me give him an indication of his Government's record in supporting children in poverty. I will read a few extracts from a document produced by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) in October 1988 entitled Income Support Policies, Taxation and Incentives. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was a significant increase in child poverty from 7.9 per cent of all children in 1972-73 to 20.7 per cent of all children in 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA>As a direct result of the policies of this Government, 20.7 per cent of all children in this country in 1985-86 lived in circumstances of poverty. That report goes on to deal in part with the difficulties and the social problems of some of those families. Let me quote just two of them. One of them says:</PARA>
<PARA> However, many of the families most in need (single parent and recent immigrant families in particular) lead a very restricted social existence . . . Many report that this absence of the outward signs of respectability contributes to children's dislike of school and that families withdraw from the whole round of community activities such as children's sport, school excursions, parent-teacher meetings and the exchange of visits with friends and relatives. Family holidays are regarded as a luxury and, for many, recreation is confined to television or tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the record of this Government-television or tobacco. That is the record that Senator Childs comes in here and defends-television or tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to talk about the health determinants of poor families. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Family health is a most important determinant of the capacity to cope on low incomes. The low medical outlays of poor families . . . are due mainly to medical subsidies provided to poor families but they still report great difficulty in dealing with chronic ill health. They were often unable to afford medication, special diets, or medical equipment (e.g. Ventolin equipment for asthmatic children) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the record of Senator Childs-a social life of tobacco and television and the inability to afford simple medication for their children. That is the record that Senator Childs, from the great vantages of life on Scotland Island, wants to come into this chamber today and talk about. </PARA>
<PARA> In this EPAC report, we find, for example:</PARA>
<PARA> The dominant reason for increased spending on social security-</PARA>
<PARA>about which this Government waxes so lyrical-</PARA>
<PARA>has been increased numbers of recipients rather than more generous levels of benefits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is not that Senator Childs's Government is spending more because it wants to raise the level of people in the welfare system; it has to spend more because there are more people in need of financial support under his Government. In this report, under the heading `Some areas of inadequacy', it says that attention should be drawn to these two points:</PARA>
<PARA> the incidence of relative poverty has increased more among younger than older groups;</PARA>
<PARA> single parent and two parent families with children have been particularly adversely affected; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the record of Senator Childs's Government. That is the record that he is in here defending today. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look at the impact on the health of children so grievously betrayed by the Hawke Labor Government. Look at the annual report issued the other day of the Australian Institute of Health. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments could have their greatest impact on health by reducing socioeconomic disadvantage through programs that reduce unemployment and improve social security and community support services. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has driven 20.7 per cent of Australian children into a situation of poverty, which leads inevitably to ill health, deprivation, and often from there to drug abuse and domestic violence. They are all consequences of poverty, induced deliberately by the economic management of this Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the 1986-87 annual report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, it states, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> compared with people without children on the same income level, the real disposable incomes of all families with children had declined;</PARA>
<PARA> the larger the family, the greater the relative disadvantage in real income;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> increased numbers of families with children had incomes which were below current poverty lines;</PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the May 1987 bulletin of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, one finds this absolutely prescient line:</PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, poverty in Australia is about families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the record of Senator Childs's Government. That is the record which has so far been defended by speakers from the Australian Labor Party, the matchless Senator Colston and the hapless Senator Childs, and we are soon to hear from Senator Maguire. At least one can say of Senator Maguire that, since Senator Cook has been elevated to the front bench, we are spared the Tweedledum and Tweedledee approach to economic analysis which we suffered for so long from those two benighted spokesmen for the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire would not only defend the massacre of the innocents but he would find a good economic justification for it if he was told to by his political masters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me look at one simple statistic about the way in which this Government has managed the tax system and the welfare system. I quote the first paragraph of an article in the Age of 17 November 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> If a single parent in public housing earns extra money, she or he can face an effective marginal tax rate in excess of 140 per cent-nearly triple the top rate of a highly paid executive. </PARA>
<PARA>And Senator Childs comes into this place today and tells us that it is fair, decent and equitable for a family with children, living in public housing, to be subjected to effective marginal tax rates of 140 per cent while his Government legislates to reduce the tax burden on the richest, the wealthiest and the most secure in the community. It is no wonder that people, whether they are in Balga, Adelaide, Oxley or New South Wales, nail this Government to the mast for having been the government with the greatest record of increasing social inequity of any government seen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission stated in a press release on 10 February 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> A family on average weekly earnings with five children, for example, will be able to keep 90.41% of its income as of June 1988 even after Family Allowance Supplement compared to the 96.75% of its income it was allowed to keep in 1976-77. Such a family will be $33.66 a week worse off. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be $33.66 a week worse off as a result of deliberate Hawke Government policies. For example, in the housing sector, when the first home owners scheme was introduced, one could get a loan equivalent to about 11 per cent of the cost of the first home. The value of that is now down to 5 per cent. One knows that the loan repayment on median house prices is now about 34.7 per cent of average household disposable income compared with 26.2 per cent in the September quarter of 1987. One knows that this Government positively refuses to take action to consult areas of child and youth poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare report on homeless youth, what has the Government done to address those problems? It has done absolutely nothing. One sees in Victoria, where there is a socialist government in power as well, that only one in five women who are victims of domestic violence can get accommodation in refuges because of the combined policies of the Hawke and Cain Labor governments. When Senator Maguire follows in a couple of minutes, he can answer this question: Why is it that the South Australian Government, in its own report, admits that there are 30,000 children in South Australia in a state of chronic poverty being robbed of their future whose interests are not being addressed by the Federal Government?</PARA>
<PARA> One can look, for example, at the promises made by this Government to address the question of child poverty. During a policy speech, and I will come back to this in a moment, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made some promises about child poverty-hollow, hopeless and terrible promises, made without any attempt to give these children proper recognition or to address policies to them. One suspects so far as this Labor Government is concerned that the only family that it knows intimately is the Cosa Nostra, that the only family it cares about is The Family, because that is where it finds its real areas of social concern. It is not really addressing the fundamental problems. As I said, during the last policy speech-a concoction of lies, half truths and empty rhetoric; classical Hawkespeak, full of sound and fury signifying nothing-the Prime Minister at the last election promised that by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. The man whose government has pushed 20.7 per cent of Australian children into poverty promised that, like Moses, he would now lead them across the Red Sea. There are now more children-a record number of children-living in poverty. For them, under this awful Government the prospect is more bleak, more stark, more hopeless than it ever has been. How gross, how hollow, how obscene is Mr Hawke's promise-the very centrepiece of that farrago of fiction, that litany of lies, that web of deceit and duplicity masquerading like a whore on the streets under the guise of the Hawke Labor Party's last policy speech. That is precisely what the Government offers to the people of Australia. The matter of urgency that is before us today states:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of Labor's economic and social policies which have increased the burdens on all Australian families and the need for the Government to adopt policies which provide incentive for individuals, strengthen the family and encourage the growth of private enterprise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That will be achieved one day, but it will be achieved only by a change of government. It will be achieved only when the Government which has pushed 20.7 per cent of the children of Australia into poverty is itself pushed out of government and we remove Senator Childs and his Scotland Island vistas, Senator Richardson and his leafy glen in Killara, Mr Hawke's full time occupation of prime real estate at Kirribilli, and send them and the Labor Party back into touch with the people, back into touch with the real families in Australia, back into touch with the real problems of Australia. They will learn to their cost that what they have done to the Australian community is and remains unacceptable to the Australian community, which will exact from them at the next election the proper retribution that should be visited upon them and upon their policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating an urgency motion moved by Senator Chaney on economic and social policies. Today we are debating a work of fiction and not of fact. The motion that has been moved today by Senator Chaney is very much like Mr Howard's manifesto, his so-called true blue blueprint which was released over the weekend. It is a manifesto which is full of contradictions and flaws-just like the motion that is being debated here today by Opposition spokespersons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do the Liberals propose when they get into government, if they ever do? They are proposing leadership from behind, rather than leadership from the front. They are not taking a stand on the issues at all. They are going out into the community-to the pollsters, the advertising men, the media manipulators-and saying, `Let us find out what the people want, and then we will tell them that we agree with it too'. That is the whole thrust of the manifesto that was released over the weekend. Mr Howard and the Liberals are simply saying to the people of Australia, `If you want it, we will agree with it'. That is the position. No wonder national political commentators such as Mr Matthew Abraham, the political writer for the Adelaide Advertiser, this morning described Mr Howard's manifesto in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> As a piece of political ideology, however, it is essentially dishonest, and quite cynically so. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Matthew Abraham was reporting on the weekend manifesto launch by Mr Howard and the Liberal Party. It is a manifesto that is flawed and full of contradictions. In fact, we need to look at the fine print of this document. I notice that the manifesto refers to crime fighting and law enforcement. The line is, `John Howard, the crime buster'. I thought that law and order and crime crackdown were State matters. Time and time again, day after day, week after week, month after month, members of the Liberal Party come into this House and accuse Labor members of Parliament of being soft on State rights. Day after day, week after week, we are told continually, `You don't believe in States rights or federalism'. Yet members of the Opposition have moved this urgency motion today, after the weekend's manifesto in which they say they will intrude into the State field. They will intrude into the law and order field of government in Australia by introducing John Howard, crime buster. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what members of the Liberal Party did in five years in government in Australia. I heard a smart alec joke from Senator Puplick a moment ago about the Cosa Nostra. The fact is that Mr Howard killed off the jobs in Australia. He was the man who took work away from 186,000 people in the last years of the Fraser Government. A total of 186,000 Australians were thrown on the industrial scrap heap because Mr Howard killed off jobs. He brought misery and despair to countless thousands of Australian families because of the way the labour market was run down in the last 12 months he was the Treasurer of Australia. He left Australia with double digit unemployment; he left Australia with more than one person in every 10 out of work: 10.4 per cent of the Australian labour force was out of work when Mr Howard left the treasury bench in March 1983. The record was double digit unemployment. Now unemployment is down not to 9 per cent or 7 per cent, but to 6.9 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent under the Liberal Party. On 17 September last year, in his response to the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), Mr Howard said, `Unemployment is stuck on 8 per cent'. That is the sort of economic credibility that Mr John Howard has as an economic manager. After five years as Treasurer of this country he still gets it wrong in opposition. He said that unemployment was stuck on 8 per cent. It is not even 8 per cent or 7 per cent; it is now 6.9 per cent. The bare-faced cheek of this man, bringing this manifesto in over the weekend and claiming that he can manage the economy better and do a better job than the Labor Party! People's memories are not so short. They remember his years as the Treasurer in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at Mr Howard's record on the cost of living and at prices. The Fraser-Howard Liberal Government really decimated family budgets in this country through cost of living rises. Honourable senators should just look at the record of inflationary price rises, the spiral in prices that occurred when John Howard was Treasurer. Honourable senators should not forget that the Liberals' policy was `Fight inflation first'. The whole thrust of their economic policy from 1978 to 1982 was to fight inflation first. That was the thrust of their policy, the central theme, the core of it. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened when they left office? There was 11 1/2 per cent inflation-the cost of living was rising to double digit levels-in the 12 months up to the March quarter of 1983. That was the record of these people. Not only did they have double digit unemployment, they had double digit inflation. And they said that they were going to fight inflation first! They said time after time, year after year, that they would fight inflation first. Inflation was 11 1/2 per cent when they left office-that was the record-and the Treasurer was John Howard. He brought down five Budgets. From 1978 until 1982 John Howard was the Treasurer of this country and he said that he would fight inflation first. Look at the record: 11 1/2 per cent unemployment, a double digit rate. Look what the Liberals say now in this manifesto. I had the opportunity of reading the document on the plane on my way here this afternoon. What does it say? What will the Liberals do about prices? They are going to bring the cost of living down by abolishing the Prices Surveillance Authority. That is their contribution. These are the people who left Australia with double digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has moved a motion here today about incentive. I have asked Senator Chaney repeatedly-I know that he is a lawyer and not an economist-over the years in this place what he means by incentive. I know that the Opposition parties had this buzz word several years ago called `incentivation'. I am not quite sure what that was supposed to mean either. I suppose that this manifesto will go the same way as the incentivation concept that was brought in here some time ago. I have asked Senator Chaney several times what he means by incentive. I know that he is a lawyer and that he does not understand these things. Does he mean the incentive to work, to save, to spend, or to take leisure? I would be very interested to find out what he means. If he means anything about the marginal tax rates, I am happy to debate that at any time with him because the record is that Labor has reduced the marginal tax rates significantly since it has been in office. Let us look at the record. When the present Opposition left power the lowest marginal tax rate was 30c in the dollar. It is now 24c in the dollar. There has been a clear improvement in that rate. Look at the top rate. When the Liberals were in power those in the highest income tax bracket in Australia paid 60c in the dollar. The top rate is now 49c in the dollar. So again it is clear that there has been a tangible improvement under the Labor Government, led by Bob Hawke. They are the sorts of things that need to be looked at when this Parliament debates matters affecting families. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going to happen to the entertainment tax? I looked through the manifesto today but I could not see any reference to free lunches. From what Senator Messner and others have said I understand that the Liberal Party is going back on the hustings to support the free lunch, that incredibly unfair and unjust rort that we dispensed with in 1985. Under that benefit people from the big end of town, the wealthy and the pin-stripe brigade were taking their families out to lunch on Sundays and charging it up to the taxpayer. That was the sort of abuse that went on under the people opposite and I want to know what John Howard's position is now on the free lunch. I noticed in the manifesto Mr Howard's position on the fringe benefits tax. He says in the manifesto something to the effect that he will reform the fringe benefits tax.</PARA>

I noticed in the manifesto, and this does relate to families--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. We are talking about the Government's economic and social policies and the need to strengthen the family. One means by which the Labor Party will continue to strengthen the family is by refusing to bring in a consumption tax. We have regularly and repeatedly made it clear that we will not be bringing in a consumption tax. I wanted to look at this area because consumption tax will be one of the great dividing points at the next election campaign. We have made it abundantly clear time and time again that we will not be bringing in a general consumption tax. Mr Howard says that he will not bring one in during his first term. That is a lay down misere: it definitely means that one will be introduced during his second term. Quite clearly, a general consumption tax will be brought in by Mr Howard in his second term of government, if ever he gets into government. That is a great difference between the major parties in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are only two areas of revenue left in the community from which significant additional revenue can be obtained by a general consumption tax-food and clothing. I wish Senator Bjelke-Petersen was here because I can remember her shedding crocodile tears in a speech some time ago about the possibility of a tax on kiddies' shoes. From looking at the way this motion is worded and from looking at the documents that have been released over the weekend there is a real chance that in the second term of any Howard Liberal Government a broad based consumption tax would be brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals bleat about the family. They have made continual claims about how the family has been mistreated over the last five years from an economic point of view, but I want to look at the question of wages. That is a very important area. Of the last 20 national wage cases which have come before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Liberals have opposed rises for working class Australian families on 18 occasions. I would like to hear them debate that record. If there was inflation at a high level in the Australian community, the Liberals said, `No wage rise'; if there was low inflation they said, `No wage rise'. If there was high economic growth they said, `No wage rise'; if there was low economic growth they said, `No wage rise'. It was the same recipe time after time: no wage rise for the Australian work force. That was the record of these people. They wanted to keep wages down, to control wages growth. Now the Liberals are promising to abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority, the body which is responsible for monitoring prices and examining price rises in the Australian community. The Liberals want to knock it off. This manifesto presents a one-sided policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Labor Government we have seen the creation of over 1.1 million new jobs, most of which are in the private sector. That has been of enormous benefit to Australian families and, of course, this motion is about families. There has been an annual average rate of growth in employment of 3 per cent under this Government. All that Mr Howard could manage when he was Treasurer was 0.7 per cent. So the annual rate of job creation under the Labor Government is four times higher than under the Liberal Government. That is the record for families when we compare the policies of the Labor and Liberal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate well remembers John Howard as Treasurer. From 1978 to 1982 he brought down five Budgets. He had record cost of living rises, record unemployment and record income tax rates. It is no accident that John Howard's approval rating in the opinion polls is low. Australian families well remember his performance as Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the eighth annual report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority and is the major report which comes to us during our bicentennial year. Of course, next year's report, in terms of providing us with details of all of the final conclusions and the wash-up from the bicentennial year, undoubtedly will make extremely interesting reading. However, I do not propose to deal with issues of the overall structure and nature of the bicentennial arrangements as the bicentennial year is not yet concluded, and I think that is more properly a debate for next year. I intend simply to make observations about a couple of matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The bicentennial program has been a mixture of triumph and failure. A large number of people have worked with enormous skill and dedication and a large number of people ought to be thanked. Just looking through the report and from my own observations, particularly having had the responsibility as shadow Minister in this area for the last year, there have been a great deal more triumphs than failures. One looks at the spectacular performances around Australia and, in particular, on Sydney Harbour on Australia Day. One looks at the arts program put in place by Peter Sarah; great undertakings such as the dance program Vast, the Mahabharata, the new plays by Michael Gow, the Circus Oz and the visit of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. One looks at the international Girl Guides and Boy Scouts jamborees in the course of the year. One looks at the visit of the giant pandas; the bicentennial around Australia air race; the bicentennial Gold Cup soccer tournament and, in particular, Australia's spectacular win over Argentina; the whole Tall Ships program; and the unrecognised but spectacular achievement of Jonathan King and the First Fleet re-enactment voyage. </PARA>
<PARA> One looks at a couple of failures. I believe that the travelling exhibition was not a great success. The Multicultural Foundation was an area which was grossly politicised by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Indeed, the two worst examples during the course of the year both involved direct politicisation by the Prime Minister-the first being this Multicultural Foundation, and the second being the diversion of funds from other purposes for support of the Macedonian exhibition. A sum of $950,000 was directed by the Prime Minister to be spent on this undertaking without the consent, or even the knowledge, of the Board and the Board members of the Bicentennial Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, a large number of people ought to be thanked. I have already mentioned Peter Sarah for his work in the arts program. I also mention the participation, in numerous events, of His Excellency the Governor-General and his family, with the greatest of distinction; the architects of the new Parliament House; and the work done in establishing this whole concept by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. On behalf of all Opposition members, I place on record our thanks to Senator Shirley Walters for her service on the Board of the Bicentennial Authority. She has been one of the parliamentary appointments to the Board. It is certainly one that is worthwhile formally recording. Thanks to those millions of Australians who have participated, despite all of the political calls that they should not, all of the pressures exerted upon them not to participate, not to be part of the celebrations, and to the overwhelming majority of the Australian Aboriginal community which supported and participated in the work of the bicentennial and its various aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we now start turning our minds to the next great celebration events in Australian history and this is the centenary of Federation. That is the important matter for people to now focus their attention on. A number of events which have their centenary between now and 2001 will take place. One thinks of the centenary of Sir Henry Parkes's Tenterfield speech and various things of this nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to say a few words this afternoon about the eighth annual report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. In doing so, I wish to congratulate Mr Jim Kirk and the Board of Directors for the excellent job that they have done during this bicentennial year. It is very pleasing to see such a very nice photograph of our colleague Senator Walters as one of the directors. They have really done a first class job. Very many functions have been held during this bicentennial year when we are celebrating 200 years of Australian history, or perhaps I should say permanent European settlement of Australia. It has been a wonderful year all round. I want to speak about World Expo 88 held in Brisbane. It certainly was the biggest event in our bicentennial year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was pretty smart of my husband to be able to say, `We'll go ahead and do it'. I think it is very good. It was certainly worth while. Twice as many people as were estimated attended Expo. I read in this report that it was hoped that a total of 16 million people would attend all the various functions in the bicentennial year. Sixteen million people visited Expo alone. As Senator McGauran said, it was a brilliant effort on behalf of our State. I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a Queensland senator, would be pleased to know that so many people came and appreciated it. The participants included 53 governments, more than 120 corporations, groups such as United Nations organisations and Australia Post, and most Australian State and Territory governments. I must say that it took a little bit of urging in the early days to get the various State governments to come along. But having visited some of the State governments' pavilions, I am quite sure that they were very pleased indeed to be taking part in such a successful function during the bicentennial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also very interested in Network 88 which is mentioned on page 37 of the report which included schools across Australia. It was the schoolmates program. This is a fantastic way to teach young people how to build friendships. I know a little about it because last year I had the privilege of going to the United States of America to open a Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation office in New York. In the course of doing so I had the opportunity to speak to two schools in Washington, one being a black school and the other a white school. The children were extremely interested in what I was able to tell them about Australia. The children from those schools were writing to schools here in Australia. With assistance from the American Australian Bicentennial Foundation, schoolmates matched 902 Australian schools with schools in the USA. Not only did I have the chance of speaking to those two different schools in Washington but also I was privileged to speak to one in New Jersey. When I came home I went to our local Kingaroy convent and had a chance to speak to the young people about the letters that they were writing. As far as I am concerned that is the way to build bridges. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, as far as Queensland is concerned, another important function that has been finalised during the bicentennial year is the Stockman's Hall of Fame out in Longreach. That will be absolutely wonderful not only for tourism in Longreach, in the central west of Queensland, but also for the very many towns around that area where people stay as they are travelling out to Longreach. I believe that that is very good indeed. Locally, in our Kingaroy district where I come from, we have a museum. A book has been written about the early history of those days. These are excellent ways of celebrating our Bicentennial. I want to congratulate the Australian Bicentennial Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous honourable senators have said, this bicentennial year has had its ups and downs. But we should be looking at some of the highlights of the bicentennial year. It has already been touched upon by Senator Puplick but I would like to expand quickly in the short time available on what I think is one of the highlights, along with World Expo 88-the Tall Ships event. It epitomised the spirit of Australia and its history. It drew attention to two of the most beautiful harbours in the world-Sydney Harbour and the port of Hobart. Those who were lucky enough to participate or to see that event would have to say that it was one of the most spectacular and outstanding events of 1988. People from all around the world aged between 16 and 25 were given the opportunity to experience the racing of these elegant vessels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Talking to the people involved, there is no doubt that it must have been a magnificent cultural event for those people to have been part of that particular race. It certainly captured the imagination of the people of Australia and, I believe, it also captured the spirit and the imagination of the people of the world. It brought a lot of attention to Australia-not that Australia needed any attention during its bicentennial year. But it certainly brought a lot of attention to it particularly because of our maritime history. It was no surprise to those of us involved in the organisation of the tall ships that by the time the event got under way 18 different countries were represented. When Tall Ships commenced on 8 December a total of 222 vessels were officially registered to take part. In addition, 29 others participated in the special division of the Tall Ships race. </PARA>
<PARA> That fleet of 251 ships was the largest international fleet ever gathered in Australia. I doubt that we will ever see anything like that again, at least not for another 200 years. As I said, it focused attention on two of the most magnificent harbours in the world. As far as Tasmania was concerned, it brought together not only many people from around the world but also many Tasmanians. I have no doubt that it was the most spectacular event in Tasmania during the bicentennial year. It gave Tasmanians a chance to show their undoubted hospitality. It certainly was a financial coup for the local retailers, particularly the photographers. It gave us a chance to show off our hospitality industry. For those people who were lucky  enough--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. I thank Senator Ray. I take this opportunity to comment on the marvellous effort that was put in by many of our service groups such as the Marine Board of Hobart, the Tasmanian police, the service clubs, the state emergency services, and the yacht clubs and community groups that were involved. We will be able to look back on this event with many happy memories. Tasmania's entrant, the Lady Nelson, is a replica of one of our most famous early vessels, a first fleet vessel which was unofficially the mother or perhaps father of the Royal Australian Navy. It was the first armed ship stationed in Australia. It participated in many surveys around many places, including Melbourne and Bass Strait. I am pleased to say that this wonderful replica, which was completed thanks to such publicly spirited people as Don Hazell, who now heads the Re-enactment Committee, and will be officially commissioned on Saturday by the Governor. I am very pleased and proud, as I think all Tasmanians are, of the fact that at last we have a replica of one of our most famous early ships that not only participated in the history of Tasmania but also played a very significant part in the history of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the 1987-88 report of the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA) I want to limit my remarks to that part of the report which refers to the First Fleet. In particular I want to refer to page 24 of the tabled report where it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Every headland, every beach and every grassy bank was packed with families and as the fleet entered the bay the sun shone and hundreds of welcoming craft surrounded the ships despite a heavy two metre swell. It was a day to be remembered and second only to what followed. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It was truly an epic venture and one which was embraced by all Australians as an important part of our Bicentennial celebrations. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to contrast those remarks in the ABA's own report with comments that were made at the fourth meeting of the ABA Board on 7 November 1980 when it was resolved by the Board that:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) the proposal as conceived by the First Fleet Re-enactment Committee . . . not be endorsed by the Authority for the following reasons . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Among those reasons are cited these:</PARA>
<PARA> its inapplicability to much of Australia in terms of geography and popular interest,</PARA>
<PARA> the inevitable lack of authenticity,</PARA>
<PARA> its tendency to be divisive of the Australian people,</PARA>
<PARA> the undue emphasis on the past,</PARA>
<PARA> concern about risks and physical safety,</PARA>
<PARA> the unlikelihood of either the corporate sector contributions or the UK Government gift proposal's being feasible . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to quote remarks of the then secretary to the then Premier, Mr Gerry Gleeson. On 18 June 1985 in a letter to Mrs McCarthy, the Acting Chairman of the New South Wales Bicentennial Council, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The re-enactment of Captain Phillip's epic voyage is an imaginative venture which will focus national and international attention on New South Wales in the lead-up to the Bicentennial year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He asked for the endorsement of the Council. The Australian Bicentennial Authority, in its report, seems to be claiming some sort of credit for the First Fleet, when the support it gave was paltry and mean in the meanest sense. At page 121 of the tabled report there is listed a debt of $500,000. It shows that the First Fleet re-enactment owes that amount to the Bicentennial Authority. In these few remaining minutes I refer to a further letter from Mr Gerry Gleeson in his capacity as Chairman of the New South Wales Bicentennial Committee which sums up the meanness of the attitudes. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government through the Bicentennial Council has been supportive of this project since we regard it as one of the outstanding, if not the outstanding, event of the Bicentenary . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . when one compares the benefits being derived from this project from the small investment of the ABA compared with the $10.3m investment in the Tall Ships I am really at a loss to understand how we have got our priorities so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>On that day in Sydney Harbour on 26 January it was indeed the First Fleet as she sailed into the harbour-almost as much a miracle as the landing of Captain Phillip-that really got the attention of the people. What a shame it was that the First Fleet had to be somehow seen in competition with the tall ships when both projects could have been seen as viable. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly encourage the Bicentennial Authority to forgive that debt of $500,000, to match up the rhetoric that is in its report when it claims credit somehow for that First Fleet re-enactment and to allow at least the endeavours of the people who stuck to their principles and allowed that event to take place to somehow break even. Their persistence, their endeavours, I feel, were a true reminder of the sort of courage that was entailed in setting up the first colony. There are many other tales that are starting to come out of the injustice of the Australian Bicentennial Authority which I would like to deal with at a later time. Therefore, I seek leave of the Senate to continue my remarks on that matter later. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Taxation Office collected $60 billion in revenue in 1987-88. In fact, this was $2.4 billion above the Budget estimate and a staggering 14.7 per cent above the previous fiscal year. This 14.7 per cent compares with a consumer price index inflation factor of 7.3 per cent. No wonder living standards are falling as disposable earnings are declining. The statistics in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation show that income tax receipts had increased by more than $3 billion over the previous year from pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers' tax instalments deductions. The sales tax increase was $1 billion extra. Bank account debits tax increased by $79m and the prescribed payments tax reaped an additional $191m. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the 22 October issue of the Australian taxpayers journal, The Taxpayer, in which it was pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>The time has come and passed for low income earners who should have received substantial income tax cuts. The Government must stick to its promise to introduce tax cuts by its July 1989 deadline. By that time, however, the Australian taxpayer on average weekly earnings will be worse off to the tune of $30 to $40 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation is being tabled in this place at a time when taxation administration has assumed a profile never before known in this country. This is due, of course, in part to the fact that the Hawke-Keating Administration is the highest taxing government in Australia's history, taking taxes from ordinary low and middle income earners as no government has previously done. The outcome is that the Australian Taxation Office is now suffering from an image problem. It has a responsibility to improve its relations with tax agents and tax professionals as well as to continue to catch the principal tax evaders. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of tax laws is not always as parliament intended. For example, redundancy payments are taken to be forgone benefits. How ridiculous! These are taxed at a higher rate than that which applies to normal termination payments, rather than the rule which Parliament clearly intended in 1983. Whilst the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, is a very competent and objective public servant and has served governments of both political colours exceedingly well, the present Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Hawke Government have put unfair, or undue, pressure on the Australian Taxation Office to administer so many new and changed laws. The corporate plan that the Taxation Office has developed is a good one, but that endorsement is made with the cautious remark that I hope the office has the resources and the staff to effectively implement this ambitious plan. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner of Taxation</PARA>
<PARA> During the year of this report, as detailed at page 115, 15 tax Bills were introduced into the Parliament. Honourable senators will know that more have been introduced since that time, adding to the complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I note that the Policy and Legislation Group of the office has an average staffing level of about 70 persons and that they dealt with 1,100 items of correspondence and issued 11 rulings. I call on the Treasurer to increase the number of legal officers in the Taxation Office so that they can better service the Act and provide more appropriate taxation rulings. Of late the professionals have been rather critical and have sought to ensure that in Taxation Office rulings there is an appropriate or direct linkage between the objective analysis of the rulings and the taxation officer's preferred position. I now turn to some of the statistics in the report. Page 29 of the report states that PAYE taxation receipts exceeded the Budget estimates by $739m. Page 117 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Regretfully it was necessary to suspend the legislation unit that was established in the Melbourne Branch Office during 1985-86 because of logistical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislative workload has not decreased significantly, according to one officer, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the work and the workload are demanding and the atmosphere can become almost crazed during Parliamentary sittings prior to the introduction of legislation, when explanatory memorandums have to be written on top of the finalisation of the bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fitting that the first line of the overview by the Australian Commissioner of Taxation in his annual report-particularly as we have the highest taxing government in this country's history-states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In Australia's bicentennial year, it is worth noting that taxes have played a major part in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that that will be taken on board by most of the people in the community who have copped the brunt of this high taxing government. The Commissioner goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Over those years . . . there have been a lot of changes. More recently we have seen the introduction of the prescribed payments system . . . fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax . . . and dividend imputation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What he neglects to say is that, since this Government has been in power, we have seen the entertainment tax; the Medicare levy; sales tax on citrus drinks, wine, flavoured milk, et cetera; a new superannuation tax that takes the money off the front end; a tax on Telecom Australia and Australia Post; automatic indexation of taxes on things such as cigarettes and beer-even though there was a reduction on the excise in the last Budget there was an increase in sales tax, so there was an offset-increased fees for passports; and the abolition of rebates and concessions to the extent that a person's gross income is now his taxable income. His is a very simple presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise to speak to the report because of comments made earlier by Senator Maguire, who put over the quite phoney message that somehow this Government has reduced taxation. Let me provide a few figures. In 1982-83, income tax on individuals amounted to $22.9 billion. In 1988-89, according to the Budget Papers, the figure will be $46.6 billion-a whacking increase of 107.2 per cent in five years. Company tax has gone up from $4.8 billion to $11.2 billion-an increase of 132 per cent. Senator Maguire said earlier that if a Liberal government were in power people would run the risk of a consumption tax. The Hawke Government has introduced a consumption tax by stealth. Since this Government has been in power, sales tax has gone up from $3.49 billion to $8.63 billion-an increase of 147 per cent. </PARA>

That is not something of which we should be proud: in fact, we should be ashamed of it when we compare Australia with the rest of the world. Notwithstanding that 51.6 per cent increase in the CPI, sales tax has increased by 147 per cent and income tax on individuals-the average weekly earner with a family-has increased by 107.2 per cent. Senator Maguire says that the Government has reduced taxes. What he is talking about is the top marginal rate of tax. In the same period, the vast majority of Australians are now paying a marginal tax rate of 40c in the dollar. That is what Senator Maguire neglects to tell the people of Australia when he talks about reducing taxes, which is one of the great myths, in addition to the many others, perpetrated by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was privileged to be one of the six Australian parliamentary delegates to the eightieth conference of the IPU held in Sofia, Bulgaria, from 19 to 24 September this year. The leader of the delegation was the Hon. Tom Uren; the deputy leader was Mr Roger Shipton; and the other members of the delegation were Mr Peter Cleeland, Mr David Jull and Mr David Simmons. When this report was tabled in the other place Mr Uren said that `this was a happy delegation which worked well together. There was cooperative teamwork'. I endorse that view. Meetings were held prior to our departure to prepare us for the event of the IPU. We were briefed by officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and staff from the Parliamentary Library. I was also fortunate to have a briefing with officers of Amnesty International at its headquarters in London en route to Sofia, where I was well advised on the discrimination against the Turkish minority in Bulgaria. I will make another remark about that later. Amnesty had been invited to attend the IPU conference for the first time, with observer status, because the human rights issue was prominent on the agenda. Amnesty was very pleased to be there for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ninety-five countries took part in the conference with a total of 770 delegates, including 455 members of parliament. On the day prior to the conference-that is, Sunday, 18 September-there was a meeting of women parliamentarians. Sixty parliamentarians from 39 countries were present at that meeting, which was held in the Bulgarian National Assembly under the chairmanship of Mrs Lagadinova, a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly. The discussions were very fruitful and ranged far and wide. I think the most important matter discussed was ways of improving the participation of women parliamentarians in the activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In this connection participants considered a proposed amendment to the statutes of the Union which was submitted by the Canadian group, which guaranteed the membership of at least two women on the executive committee, and a suggestion from the group from Zaire for an amendment to the statutes of the Union aimed at ensuring that more women are council members. The amendment was carried. I am pleased to say that the rules of the conference specify that, for the time being, at least two members of the executive must be women. That will provide some catch-up time, as in the 99 years of existence of the IPU there has hardly ever been a woman on the executive committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The items on the agenda for the conference dealt primarily with human rights. They dealt with the actions of parliaments in bringing their legislation into line with humanitarian principles on an international basis. They also dealt with the contribution of parliaments to the implementation of United Nations resolutions with regard to the granting of independence to colonial territories and to the elimination of colonialism, racism and apartheid. A supplementary item seeking support for talks towards achievement of comprehensive, just and lasting peace between Iran and Iraq was added to the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The involvement of the Australian delegates in Sofia was intense. Mr Tom Uren was a member of the drafting committee on the issue of decolonisation and the implementation of United Nations resolutions. Mr Roger Shipton was rapporteur for the drafting committee on the conference supplementary item on the popular uprising in the Arab territories occupied by Israel. All the other delegates had active participation in both plenary sessions of the conference as well as in committee meetings for the subject items. There can be no doubt that people can only be assured of human rights when their elected representatives are themselves guaranteed human rights. The human rights of parliamentarians was another item on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to express my special thanks to Mr Fred Peppinick, who was adviser to the delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Mr Rob Diamond, who was secretary to the delegation from the Department of the Senate. I would also like to thank those who gave us support from the Australian Embassy in Belgrade. Of course, they are all very much in our thoughts at the present time, particularly Mr Hoyle, the Ambassador, Ms Katherine Smits and Miss Christina Bogiatsis; not to mention our driver, Slovodan. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to place on record my thanks to the people of Bulgaria for their friendliness and hospitality. Travelling in Sofia's trolley buses and trams; strolling through the cobblestoned streets; sitting at pavement cafes and visiting Mount Vitosha together with the locals taking the mountain air on a Sunday-all these were very pleasurable activities of which I retain very fond memories. Glasnost is certainly in the air in Bulgaria, although the House of Assembly, with all the members' seats in rows facing the raised platform which contains the only microphones, is not a prescription for democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to mention the fate of the Turkish minority, some of whom are in the region of Khardzaly and some of whom are in more northern parts. Not only are they not permitted to celebrate openly their traditional culture, but also they are forbidden to wear their traditional Turkish-style baggy trousers. Worse, and very cruelly, they are being forced to dispense with their Turkish names and adopt Bulgarian names, or lose their jobs. This perhaps is the ultimate `One-Bulgaria' policy. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio and a related Act administered by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature. Other amendments tidy up, correct or update existing legislation. None of the amendments concerns major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. None has any significant financial impact. The amendments to the Law Officers Act will have a slight financial impact. They provide for a pension for a Solicitor-General based on a judge's pension, deferred until age 60 and discounted both for shorter term of service and the difference between age at cessation of office and 60 years. The removal of the current entitlement of a lump sum equal to twice annual salary at the end of a 7 year appointment, represents an offset against the cost of the new pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my comments to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will provide for term appointments as an alternative to the existing situation of appointments to age 70 in the case of full-time Deputy Presidents and to age 65 in the case of full-time senior members. The maximum term of such appointments would be 7 years, but reappointment could be made. At present the option of term appointment is only available for part-time Deputy Presidents, part-time senior members and ordinary members. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of term appointments as an alternative to tenured appointments for full-time Deputy Presidents and senior members will provide greater flexibility in staffing the Tribunal, primarily by enabling appointment of members on a short-term basis to handle particular backlogs or initial peaks in work when new jurisdictions are conferred on the Tribunal. The amendments are also expected to result in a widening of the pool of potential appointees to include those who might not wish to consider a career appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequential amendment to section 16 of the Act will exclude the application of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to term appointees. At present, the Judges' Pensions Act applies to a full-time Deputy President as if he or she were a judge. Part-time Deputy Presidents are excluded, and the amendment means that full-time Deputy Presidents who are term appointees will also be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will ensure that in proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the States and the Northern Territory will have the same entitlement as the Commonwealth to claim public interest privilege in respect of documents subpoenaed by the Tribunal and questions asked in the course of a proceeding which relate to Cabinet documents or the deliberations of Cabinet, or otherwise support a claim of public interest privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One amendment to the Australian Federal Police Act will give greater flexibility in administration, as the Commissioner, and not the Minister, will be empowered to determine the number of officers in the various rank levels of the Australian Federal Police. Other amendments, based on provisions in the Public Service Act will ensure that all persons eligible for appointment have a reasonable opportunity to apply for appointment to the Australian Federal Police. They will ensure equity and fairness in appointments, promotions and transfers, apply the merit principle and prohibit patronage, favouritism, and discrimination on various specified grounds as well as unlawful or any other unjustified discrimination. Also provision is made for review of non-appealable promotion decisions by the Merit Protection and Review Agency. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Customs Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the Customs Act will specifically abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination in respect of a statement furnished to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy pursuant to a Court order. However, evidence obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of furnishing such a statement to the Official Trustee will not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings, other than a proceeding in respect of falsity of the statement, or a proceeding for the recovery of a pecuniary penalty. In the latter case it will be admissible only for the purpose of facilitating the assessment of the amount of the penalty. This places information contained in such a statement in the same position as information obtained pursuant to a court-ordered examination of the person. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act will remove any doubt that may exist that the Director has the right to seek review of a bail decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Family Law Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An amendment will make a minor jurisdictional change in relation to the application of the Family Law Act in the Northern Territory. It will remove jurisdiction from the Family Court of Australia, in matters arising under a law of the Northern Territory, thereby treating the Northern Territory in the same way as a State. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments to the Family Law Act will ensure that a lawyer appointed by the Court as a separate representative for a child, in proceedings concerning the child's welfare, has adequate and effective powers to obtain a report by a psychologist or psychiatrist for use in the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of subsection 78 (3) of the Act will enable the Court, in appropriate cases, to make orders that are binding on third parties as well as the parties to a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Many family law property disputes involve adjudication of the rights of the parties to a marriage as between themselves and third parties, such as banks. As the Act presently stands, third parties may intervene in proceedings under the Act pursuant to section 92, but may not be bound by any order of the Court as a consequence of subsection 78 (3). The present lack of power to make binding determinations about the existence and extent of the rights and liabilities of third parties can be frustrating for both the court and the parties as well as adding to the expense of proceedings. For example, even if a court concludes that particular property does not belong to either party to the marriage but to a third party, the court cannot, because of subsection 78 (3), make any declaration or order in favour of the third party. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of subsection 78 (3) will also ensure that the Commonwealth and State cross-vesting legislation which came into force on 1 July 1988 has full effect in relation to the Family Court by enabling that Court to determine the rights and liabilities of third parties in proceedings before it where it is appropriate and convenient for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment gives effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its report on Matrimonial Property and to comments by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Law Officers Act 1964</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Currently, unless a Solicitor-General completes 10 years service he or she is not entitled to a judicial pension. However, under provisions in the Law Officers Act, a Solicitor-General who has completed 7 years service (the normal term of appointment) receives a lump sum payment equal to twice annual salary. This provision was intended to assist a Solicitor-General who is not reappointed at the end of that term to re-establish himself or herself in private practice. While the sum may be adequate for that purpose, it does not adequately cater for the Solicitor-General's security or that of his or her family if the Solicitor-General dies or becomes incapacitated after ceasing to hold office. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Law Officers Act is to be amended to provide for a deferred pension for the Solicitor-General, payable at age 60, after completing 7 years of service, or on prior death or invalidity, based on similar criteria for a judicial pension. The pension at age 60 is to be discounted by 2.5% per year for the difference between the age on cessation of office and age 60. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act was amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1988, to insert new foreign law testimonial immunity provisions intended to preserve the foreign testimonial immunity of witnesses who come to Australia to give evidence, and to confer similar immunity on persons who give evidence in Australia at the request of foreign countries. This Bill amends the Act to make it clear that such immunity will not apply in any case where its application would be inconsistent with the applicable Mutual Assistance Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There are several amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act, most of which have been requested by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and the Director of Public Prosecutions in the light of practical experience with the Act. Some amendments provide protection to bona fide third parties whose property interests are affected by registered foreign forfeiture orders, broadly similar to the protection provided in relation to domestic forfeiture orders. There are also a number of machinery amendments that are necessary having regard to experience with the Act to date, dealing with such matters as the meaning of the term `effective control of property', permitting the court to make composite restraining orders covering both known property of the defendant as well as property acquired after the making of the order and abrogating the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to court-ordered statements furnished to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy. An indemnity, similar to that contained in the amendment to the Customs Act, is included. The opportunity has been taken to generally improve the wording of a number of existing provisions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up part of its allocated subscription to the third general capital increase of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the main activity of the Bank, which was established in 1947, is lending to developing countries. Up to end of June 1988, the Bank had lent about $US128 billion to its member countries. This money was largely borrowed from international financial markets. The cost to taxpayers in member countries in terms of paid-in capital subscriptions was only $US7.7 billion. Projects financed covered all the major sectors of economic development with an emphasis on infrastructure facilities in the transport and communication, industry and energy sectors, as well as projects for agriculture, education and water supply. An increasing proportion of Bank loans-27 per cent of funds committed in 1987-88-finance imports in support of structural adjustment programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988 IBRD governors approved a resolution authorising a $US74.8 billion in general capital increase. Capital increases allow the Bank to expand its borrowings on world capital markets and it is these borrowings which largely finance the Bank's activities. The general capital increase will underpin the Bank's operations well into the 1990s and allow the Bank to carry through its programs aimed particularly at the most heavily indebted countries. In 1987-88 the Bank made lending commitments of $US14.8 billion. The general capital increase will allow it to increase its lending to more than $US20 billion per annum by 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the general capital increase, Australia is entitled to subscribe to an additional 10,734 shares. The Bank does not require full subscription from members immediately and members have until 1993 to subscribe, if they so desire, to the total number of shares allocated to them. The Government has decided that Australia will subscribe to 7,880 shares at an estimated cost over the five years 1988-89-1992-93 of $A35.65m. This is a very small proportion of expected Australian aid expenditure over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not decided whether Australia will subscribe to its remaining entitlement of 2,854 GCI shares or relinquish them for allocation to other members of the Bank. The Bank's projected higher lending levels are to be achieved progressively over a period of time, a gradual process which should be consistent with maintaining the quality of Bank lending. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a strong, but not uncritical, supporter of the IBRD. We are concerned that the Bank maintains the high quality of its lending and continues to be cost effective. Australia has criticised the Bank when appropriate with the aim of improving its overall efficiency. In particular, Australia has expressed concerns about the very fast rate of growth of large scale fast disbursing structural adjustment loans, the growing incidence of arrears on Bank loans, and the need to further enhance the Bank's work on environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank does have an important role to play in lending to support the adjustment process in developing countries. However, the Bank should not be lending to any country for long term structural adjustment purposes on the absence of a suitable framework of macroeconomic policies for that country. We must avoid a situation in which a country is able to obtain balance of payments financing from the Bank when it has not been able to agree an economic policy program with the International Monetary Fund. Clearly this would subvert the adjustment process. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore the Bank must encourage effective adjustment and not replace private debt with public debt. The commercial banks must play their full part in the adjustment process. It is essential for the Bank to maintain its preferred creditor status. Without this the confidence of financial markets in the Bank may be jeopardised with consequent adverse effects on the volume and terms of Bank lending. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank needs to pursue poverty alleviation and environmental aspects of its work, but it cannot compensate for all the shortcomings which might exist in national policies affecting the environment, poverty or anything else for that matter. Key issues such as population growth, natural resources, land ownership and government expenditure are sensitive matters of national policy. The Bank can assist in these areas but cannot dictate solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia gains substantial benefits from its contributions to the IBRD. Benefits from our aid, including political benefits, depend on developmental effectiveness. The World Bank group, including the IBRD and its soft loan arm, the International Development Association, have a comprehensive and systematic project evaluation system which shows that most IBRD and IDA projects-72 per cent of those evaluated in 1987, for instance-achieve all or most of their objectives. The estimated average return on projects evaluated in calendar years 1986 and 1987, measured by the flow of net economic benefits over time, was 14.5 per cent. These are good results bearing in mind the difficult environment in which the World Bank operates. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to external shocks, their social and political environment is subject to rapid shifts and they are often short of critical expertise and skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Contributions to the IBRD allows us to participate in large development projects and widen the focus of our aid at a relatively low administrative cost. The World Bank group has an important catalytic role in tackling major international economic problems such as protection and debt. The Bank provides a significant forum in which Australian initiatives can be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's membership of the IBRD also brings substantial commercial benefits. On a cumulative basis, Australia has received almost four times more for procurement by the IBRD than it has given in contributions to the IBRD. Australian cofinancing of IBRD projects can result in significant procurement benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of IBRD membership have been recognised by Australian governments over the years since the Bank's establishment. The report of the Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program-the Jackson Committee-in 1984 recommended that support for development banks in general and for the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in particular should be increased in relation to other multilateral funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it to be in Australia's interest to continue its policy of support of the IBRD by taking up the 7,880 shares of the IBRD's general capital increase. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of Bills-the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 and the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988-will be dealt with cognately, although they cover numerous matters concerning both income tax and sales tax. We in the Liberal and National parties will be proposing many amendments to these several Bills. We will be moving an amendment in relation to the second reading of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), drawing the attention of the Senate and of the people of Australia to the fact that this Government is the highest taxing government in the post-war history of Australia, that through the insidious effects of income tax bracket creep this Government has ripped off $7 billion extra from taxpayers each year since 1985-86, and that even though this new bracket creep has brought so much extra revenue into the coffers of the Government, the Government has gone about the business of raising new taxes by imposing, in this Bill, a tax on gold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gold tax will be the centrepiece of our debate tonight. We will be drawing attention to the fact that the Government has been totally misled in its action. We will show that the Government will lose revenue, rather than attract it, by imposing a tax on gold. Notwithstanding the approach we are led to believe the Government is engaged in, that is, of generally trying to lighten the burden on taxpayers, new taxes are continually being imposed. This follows the taxation package which was introduced some three years ago and which imposed taxes on capital gains, fringe benefits and other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill as presently drafted amends the sales tax legislation so that it needs to be demonstrated to the Commissioner of Taxation that sales tax refunds given by wholesalers to their customers have been passed on to customers before the Commissioner of Taxation will grant the refunds. This is a nonsense measure. Had the Government chosen to pursue it, we would certainly have opposed it. We are pleased to see that the Government is amending the Bill so as not to include that stupidity. The Government was conned by the Australian Taxation Office on this point and totally misunderstood what it was doing. It has been persuaded by argument from members of the Liberal and National parties and other people in the community to withdraw it. We welcome that flexibility, if that is what it can be called. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) will be handled by my colleague Senator Michael Baume in greater detail during his speech. However, I want to draw attention immediately to just one aspect of this Bill so that the Government is aware of what the Liberal and National parties intend in this respect. The origin of this Bill goes back to the Budget announcement on 23 August when the Government decided to impose a tax on all wrapping materials for any goods that were sold throughout Australia. However, as usual, the Government bungled the proposed legislation that it introduced on that very day, 23 August, as it omitted to cover certain situations. Later in November, the Government brought in another Bill to correct that technical defect, and that is the subject of this Bill. However, the Government has tried to impose this new technical amendment retrospectively to the date of the Budget announcement in August. That is totally unfair because the Government announced on 23 August that it would propose this tax on wrapping materials and then, on that very day, almost within minutes of the statement having been made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the House of Representatives, it introduced a Bill which spelt out the exact situation. Taxpayers were entitled to read the statement by the Treasurer in conjunction with the Bill introduced then and to decide that that Bill, although defective, would apply. For the Government to argue, some two or three months later, that a subsequent amendment, to implement what the Government had really intended earlier, should be backdated to the date of the original announcement is to impose legislation retrospectively. On that basis the Liberal and National parties will oppose it and we will move amendments to the Bill to ensure that it applies only from the date of the introduction of this Bill and not from the date of the original announcement of 23 August. </PARA>
<PARA> These things are, of course, just typical of the kinds of shortcomings to which the public do not generally have their attention drawn and which this Government continually tries to perpetrate. It continually tries to introduce retrospective legislation. It continually tries to legislate by press release. It is so out of touch. It continually tries to bring in new legislation and new taxes and yet tells us that it has not been responsible for the introduction of any new taxes since it came to power in 1983. Of course, that is totally untrue. It really hurts to go to functions and to hear the Treasurer of this country tell such outright lies when he says that no new taxes have been introduced by this Government since it came to power. Everybody knows that new taxes such as the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax have been introduced since it came to power. We know now that the subject of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is a new tax on gold. I will come to that in a minute or two. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two or three other matters included in these Bills about which we have no complaint. Firstly, there is a rebate of tax on lump sum payments of certain types of income when paid in arrears. Secondly, up to $200 of discounts on shares or rights acquired by employees under certain employee share acquisition schemes will be excluded from income tax. I hasten to add that that concession fits exactly the Liberal and National parties' policy in relation to shares as applicable to employees; consequently, the Government has picked up the Opposition's suggestions in this regard. Thirdly, there will be some adjustment to the imputation provisions as they relate to certain dividends paid before 1 July 1989 by early balancing companies, that is, those that adopt a date of balancing other than 30 June, and transitional ranking credit rules for companies in receipt of those dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two matters touch the changed arrangements as announced in May for the deduction of expenditure for the production of films, that deduction being reduced from 120 per cent of expenditure to 100 per cent. We will not be opposing that measure. There are some other minor amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the centrepiece of the Bill, which touches upon the question of gold. As we all know, up to now the proceeds of the sale of gold have generally been exempt from income tax. Dividends received by shareholders of companies that earn their profits from mining and selling gold are, of course, taxable in the hands of shareholders. Currently, that would be maintained under the new system. I will give a little background on this matter, because it is important to get the politics of it correct. As we all know, we had an election in the middle of 1987. It is interesting to recall the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), given in writing at that time. On 7 July 1987-just four days before the election on 11 July that year-he wrote to the Australian Goldmining Industry Council to indicate that there would be no gold tax introduced by this Government. Of course, that falls into line with all the promises made by the Hawke Government about taxes since it has come to power: we saw a promise that there would be no capital gains tax, no fringe benefits tax and no assets test on pensions. We saw this one wheeled out last time, four days before the election-there will be no gold tax. As soon as the election was over, out came the legislation for the gold tax to apply after 1991. By contrast, however, just before the election, on 26 June, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are totally opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. As my colleague Senator Peter Durack, Shadow Minister for Trade and Resources, stated in June last year, a Liberal government would repeal any gold tax introduced by the Labor Government. A gold tax would jeopardise the future of many existing mines and prevent the opening of new ones. Exploration and the level of investment in this important sector would also decline rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a particular concern about the effect a gold tax would have on our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>That is particularly true, even now. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's level of overseas debt and the appalling deficit in our overseas trade account make it imperative that we encourage one of the main industries contributing positively to reducing the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the Liberal and National parties 18 months ago. It is quite clear that that is a statement of intent on the part of our parties and is clearly the reason for our opposition to this measure tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Government has shown absolute hypocrisy on this issue. We have heard statements from the Treasurer and also from the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, on 16 November 1986. That date was sufficiently removed from the expected election in 1987 as to be deniable by the Prime Minister later. When announcing this Government's decision to maintain the income tax exemption for goldmining, both of them said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has concluded that the importance of encouraging active exploration and development, and of maximising production and the consequent export income generated by the goldmining industry, outweighed the arguments in favour of removing the industry's long-standing exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>I have just quoted the Prime Minister's confirmation of that on 7 July 1987. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What happened was that the Government had an election in July 1987. Of course, as soon as that election was wheeled off the stage, in came the new tax on gold. As I say, this is typical of the way that this Government behaves. The truth is that the Opposition supports the comments of those two Ministers and the Prime Minister, as they were stated before the election of last year. Our stance has not changed; it is the Government's stance that has changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us see what has happened in the economy since that time. We are now in an even more precarious balance of payments and foreign debt situation than we were in July last year when the election was held. The current account deficit blow-out in the balance of payments for the first four months of this financial year is running well ahead of Budget expectations and causing considerable concern to the financial markets, resulting in higher interest rates and higher mortgage payments for first home owners. Just recently the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the gross foreign debt figures for the September quarter. This country now owes the rest of the world a staggering $120,000m. That is a fantastic sum which, of course, will have to be paid off by the generations of Australians still to come. Obviously, this tax will hurt that foreign debt situation even further by leading to a closure of marginal mining operations and other mines involved in gold operations. Clearly that will further exacerbate our position in regard to the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> By bringing forward legislation now for the introduction of a gold tax in 1991, the Government is introducing a huge element of uncertainty, of unpredictability, into the goldmining industry. Of course, it will lead to distortions in the industry. Goldmining companies will substantially increase their operations before 1991 and cut back thereafter in order to take advantage of the exempt taxation system applicable up to that time. Quite clearly, the industry will suffer its great downturn once the tax comes into effect in 1991. Far from there not being any economic justification for continuing the exemption on gold taxes, there are very valid economic reasons to continue it. I am sure that that comes as a bit of a shock to the Government. I remind the Senate that gold has now risen to be the third largest export earner for Australia, only behind coal and wool. Gold has grown enormously as an export earner in the last several years to take that very prestigious position in terms of our overseas exports. Gold now represents approximately 6 per cent of our total merchandise exports. </PARA>
<PARA> What will be the effect of the new tax on the Government's revenue? We have to observe that it is wrong to suggest that the goldmining industry does not already pay some tax. It does pay tax. In fact, the only tax it does not pay is the tax on corporation earnings. It pays taxes on dividends, taxes arising out of goldmining profits and, of course, royalties and things of that kind. The gold tax is likely to lead to a net loss in tax revenue. In fact, a recent study by Ernst and Whinney Services Pty Ltd for the Australian Goldmining Industry Council has estimated that the Government is likely to lose some $443.6m as a result of the introduction of that tax. It is pointed out in that study that for every $1 gained by the Government from tax on goldmining profits, potentially in excess of $2 will be lost by way of direct taxes in other ways. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ernst and Whinney. The study further pointed out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An examination of the increase in the market capitalisation of the 51 major gold exploration and mining companies which comprise the Gold Index indicates that had the Government imposed a tax on gold mining profits from 1 March 1988, they would have derived current and future tax revenue from various sources of an estimated $363.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, had the Government decided not to tax gold in that way, it would have derived current and future revenue estimated at $806.9m. That means a net loss resulting from the imposition of this new tax of $443.6m. Yet the Treasurer says that there are no economic justifications for continuing with the exemption from tax of the goldmining industry. There are simply no arguments in support of that statement other than his observation that the gold industry is the only industry which enjoys a blanket exemption from paying corporation tax-corporation tax only; it is not exempt from paying capital gains tax or tax on shareholders' dividends. This is correct, of course. The gold mining industry does have an exemption from corporation tax, but there are very good economic reasons, which we now come to, why the industry should be treated differently from other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Gold is, of course, unique. It has a unique economic property and, consequently, should have unique economic considerations. The goldmining industry is also highly volatile and requires a very high level of capital expenditure compared with other industries. But if a corporation tax is applied to goldmining companies, that is going to reduce significantly the opportunity for and the capacity of goldminers to invest, because it takes funds out of the pool of money available for investment in increasing the size of the industry. It is a very high risk industry and a high cost industry, being located in the remotest areas of this continent. Consequently, it is a very difficult industry to operate. Returns are clearly uncertain and, like any export industry, it is very much dependent upon the wide fluctuations not only in the gold price itself but also in the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to observe-and now we come to the crunch-that the gold tax exemption has led to substantial employment investment and, of course, increases in exports. If we look at a few statistics to demonstrate this, I am sure this will be clear even to the Government. In 1984-85 the average level of employment in the goldmining industry was 4,184. This year, 1987-88, it is estimated that the total average employment is 7,500. In other words, there has been an increase of something like 75 per cent in employment in the goldmining industry in about four years. At the same time turnover has increased from $614m to nearly $2.4 billion. It has quadrupled in that period. Our export receipts have gone from about $550m-they have quadrupled also-to about $2,100m. That shows what has happened in this industry as a result of the exemption from tax of gold. In that time we have created jobs and brought people into the remote areas of Australia, we have created development, we have exported gold, we have created more wealth for all Australians, our export receipts have quadrupled and total turnovers have quadrupled. In 1980 we produced 18 tonnes of gold, in 1987 that figure increased to 110 tonnes and this year 127 tonnes of gold have been produced. The goldmining industry has jumped, as I mentioned earlier, from being Australia's tenth highest export earner just three years ago to being our third highest export earner. Its enormous contribution is being felt throughout the community and throughout the economy and is attacking at the very root some of the basic problems of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with some of the furphies that have emanated from desperate Ministers trying to justify a stupid decision. Senator Cook believes that because a number of new mines have opened since the May economic statement when this first arose the proposed gold tax is not having an adverse effect on the industry. That is misleading and untrue. Quite clearly, if there is a period of exemption applying until 1991, then people will be getting in for their chop in that period. It is after 1991 that the downturn in investment in new plant and mines will occur. So, as usual, Senator Cook is being misleading on behalf of the Government in trying to shore up a desperate argument in support of its case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, is continually arguing that a tax exemption on the gold mining industry supports United States companies to the extent of 35 per cent which, he claims, are owned by them. He ignores totally the withholding tax that applies to dividends that are payable overseas, the benefit to the Australian joint ventures with American companies and the value of new jobs being created as a result of that investment. However, he preaches to us in here every day that it is better to have equity investment in this country rather than loan moneys. I have heard him argue it in Question Time several times in the last week or so, and yet when it comes to the crunch, when people are prepared to put their money into this country and invest in Australia's future, he says that they cannot do that, the Government will impose a tax to make sure that they do not come in-to Australia's detriment, not benefit. Quite clearly, what is happening here is that Australia is cutting off its nose to spite its face. That is what this policy is about and what this Government is about. It simply does not have any idea of a comprehensive policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas investment is the key to the future in terms of developing industries such as this. However, Senator Walsh is content to localise his remarks to the very narrow picture of some kind of accounting mentality and ignores entirely the economic benefits that flow from the kind of investment that would be generated. We have demonstrated that export earnings and job opportunities will grow if tax exemption remains. We have demonstrated that the Government's thinking is wrong; it is not going to gain extra money by imposing a tax on the gold mining industry. Through the continual growth of the industry there must be a further growth in the income of the industry, which will in turn generate further taxes by capital gains and through dividends. That is going to lead to further benefits to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that what it is doing is going to somehow benefit the Australian community; it is not. It is imposing a greater tax on all other taxpayers in the community. The Government will be collecting $540m less by this means than if the gold mining industry were left tax free. That means that that $450m will have to be found from other taxpayers' pockets. The Government, of course, is very adept at that. The Government knows how it is going to do it; it is going to do it through bracket creep, through more sales taxes on food, in the way that it has been applying sales taxes on food in recent times, and through things like wrapping and the tuck shop, in the way that it taxes muesli bars, chocolate bars and milkshakes. All of those items are the result of this kind of taxation measure, which totally ignores economic and taxation equity and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties will be opposing those parts of the Bill which introduce the new gold tax when we come to the committee stage of the Bill. In relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation we are dealing with tonight covers a range of matters: the gold tax, about which we have heard a great deal from Senator Messner; a cut of something like 20 per cent to company tax; and some changes to the sales tax legislation in an attempt by the Government to get it right this time. Senator Messner finished on a note of criticism of the Government for introducing a plethora of legislative measures relating to the tax area with which the Opposition does not agree. I think it is worth while pointing out yet again that many of those measures would not have passed this place had it not been for the support given to them by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I was vastly amused, inasmuch as anybody could be amused by Mr Howard's document released at the weekend, to notice that the Australian newspaper, which covered that document in some detail, noted that among its education measures the Liberal Party is planning, if it ever gets into government, to repeal the tertiary tax. I remind the Senate that the tertiary tax has not yet become law, predominantly because we have not debated the legislation. It might be worth while the Liberal Party remembering that it would not have to worry about repealing the legislation when it gets back into government if it simply opposed it in the first place next week or the week after when it comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it rather extraordinary to read in a newspaper today that an alternative government is planning on repealing a piece of legislation which it is planning on supporting in a couple of weeks. The reason it is planning on supporting this legislation, as it has supported so much anti-social government legislation, stems from the decision the Opposition took in 1983 to pass all of the Government's Budget legislation. In fact, Senator Chaney, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and would-be Prime Minister, I gather, wrote in July this year in the Parliamentarian the following:</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that since losing government in 1983, the Liberal Party, the main opposition party, has said it believes the government should be able to secure passage of its budgetary measures. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The official opposition, that is, the Liberal and National Parties, have gone much further than the Democrats in restricting this voting opposition to financial measures. In all but extraordinary cases such as legislation imposing retrospective obligations, the opposition as a matter of principle allowed the passage of financial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In that article Senator Chaney mentions only as an extraordinary case the retrospectivity of a piece of legislation. Certainly those of us who were in this place during the debates on the bottom of the harbour schemes--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those of us who were here at the time of the debates on the bottom of the harbour legislation will remember the flak that those of us who opposed the retrospective element of that legislation copped. Nevertheless, it is an acceptable principle that one does not impose a burden on anybody retrospectively, and that is something, I guess, that we can all live with. To argue that the gold tax is somehow an extraordinary circumstance, notwithstanding the interjection a minute ago from Senator Michael Baume that the Government promised not to introduce it, is simply quite silly. We ought in this place to be looking at legislation on its merits, whether it is a Budget Bill, a May economic statement Bill, or a piece of legislation that the Government said it would not introduce but did. I find it somewhat astonishing that Senator Michael Baume can perceive that element of the Government's actions as hypocritical when he does not seem to see anything even remotely odd about Mr Howard promising to repeal a piece of legislation that has not passed this chamber yet, but will because the Opposition will support it when it gets here. That sort of Alice in Wonderland stuff I think really is extraordinary, and something should be done about the Liberals' attitude in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So I suggest that the Opposition is not opposing the gold tax legislation because of the Government's broken promise on the matter, although that may be a convenient hook on which to hang its opposition. The simple fact is that as a political party the Liberal Party has, with the Western Australian election coming up, been bought not for 30 pieces of silver but for a few lousy ounces of gold. That is the big temptation-the Western Australian election due in 1989. That temptation has led the Liberal Party to be sold, essentially, to those in the goldmining industry. An additional factor has been thrown up. It was recently announced that Elders Resources Ltd is now among the top 10 gold producers in Australia and I presume that the Federal President of the Liberal Party would take somewhat unkindly the support of the Opposition parties for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us in this package of Bills an attempt by the Government to correct an anomaly that has been outstanding for far too long; namely, that goldmining companies, of all companies, are exempt from tax. I find it extraordinary that anybody can justify an exemption from company tax to only one industry when that one industry is a mining industry that produces a luxury metal and, from the point of view of the Australian Democrats, desecrates large amounts of the environment in order to do so. Let us get one thing perfectly straight: this is not a gold tax in the sense that many people seem to think it is. It is the extension of normal company tax to the goldmining industry. </PARA>

In any event it is a simple fact that this is not an additional tax on gold; it is the removal of an exemption that has existed and has applied only to goldmining companies. It is rather ironic to hear the whingeing that comes from some Australian States because those States themselves--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially Queensland. We could not expect anything else from Queensland. That sort of consistency is not something we would normally expect from that State. That fact of the matter is that Queensland, like all other States except Western Australia and Victoria, does apply State charges, royalties and so on on gold production. Some of them can be fairly hefty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These imposts vary, of course. As I said, the goldmining industry is exempt from paying royalties in Western Australia and Victoria. In other States the royalties levied on gold range as follows: in New South Wales, 4 per cent of value of production; in Queensland, 2 per cent of gross proceeds in excess of $30,000 or 5 per cent of net profit above $30,000, whichever is the greater-they are getting a bit each way there; in South Australia it is 2.5 per cent of the value of production; in Tasmania there is a progressive royalty rate with an option for ad valorem or profit based royalties ranging from 2.5 per cent of revenue or 5 per cent of profits to 3.5 per cent of revenue or 7 per cent of profits; and in the Northern Territory 1.25 per cent of ex-mine value, 2.5 per cent of the same value in the case of Aboriginal land or reserves; and mines that commenced construction after 30 June 1982 are charged 18 per cent of profit before income tax. Those States that are bleating about the damage which is likely to be caused to employment and production in that area need to have a look at the amount they are raking into their own coffers before they start that little exercise. On the grounds that such an exemption is inequitable under any circumstances but particularly that it is inequitable in the area of goldmining, the Democrats will be supporting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would have to say that, ironically enough, we also find ourselves supporting the Opposition's attachment to the second reading motion on the grounds that we accept that the Government has reneged on a promise. The fact that the application of a company tax on goldmining has been Democrats' policy for a long time does not absolve the Government from its promise not to introduce it. Inasmuch as the Opposition's second reading attachment is a general bash around the ears of the Labor Government, we are happy enough to support it. But I would like to say to the Opposition parties that, if they feel that they can deny the Government this piece of budgetary legislation simply on the grounds that the Government promised not to do it, they should start thinking a little more closely about some other pieces of Government legislation that have been changed between proposal and implementation-and I include in that the tertiary tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before us also give effect to the Government's May economic statement decision to encourage employee ownership of shares in the companies for which they work. Of course, the Democrats welcome this decision to move down a path that, I might add, we as a party have been advocating since 1977. We believe that employees who have a direct stake in the companies they work for will be inclined to be more productive. As I have said, we have been arguing about that for over 10 years and have put before this place private member's legislation to encourage just that sort of scheme. Our Bill would have gone further than this legislation; nevertheless, we believe that the Government has made a start in an area that has been overlooked for far too long. We applaud the Government for that and will be supporting it. We believe that businesses which give their employees a share in the enterprise and a say in its management should be given generous tax incentives. That is not the case here, but the amendment is at least a step in the right direction because it excludes from income tax up to $200 of discounts on shares acquired by employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also moving in the area of lump sum payments in arrears. The legislation finally moves to overcome an anomaly in the tax system about which I have made representations, and I presume other senators and members of the other place would have made representations to the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Clause 27 gives effect to the Government's decision to introduce a rebate for certain incomes received as a lump sum in arrears. Workers' and accident compensation payments, social security benefits and some salaries paid in arrears currently attract the highest marginal rate of tax because they are paid as a lump sum, notwithstanding how much the taxpayers would have paid had that money been paid out over the period they had been off work, for whatever reason. As a consequence, the highest marginal tax rate applies and they contribute in that year a much larger amount of tax than they would normally have done. If the payments had been received annually and taxed annually, a lower tax rate at the margins would have been applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a number of letters, one of which I will quote from briefly. On 30 September this year a South Australian resident wrote to me and said, among other things, that the income tax system was not working equitably in his case, for this reason: Until several years ago this man's wife had earned from full time employment approximately $27,000 per annum, on which her tax obligation averaged about 27 per cent. When through no fault of her own she sustained an industrial injury which progressively robbed her of her health and prevented her from being able to work full time, she ran into the first of the difficulties. Legal proceedings resulted in her employer reimbursing in a single lump sum the full time salary lost during the years in which she had been ill. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The total amount of reimbursed back-pay was some $72,500 which together with other earnings for that year-</PARA>
<PARA>the year in which the employer finally paid her that lump sum-</PARA>
<PARA>came to about $87,000. Her tax obligation on this gross amount was calculated at an average rate of 47 per cent and came to about $39,000. </PARA>
<PARA>As he points out in that letter, had she not sustained the inquiry and continued to work full-time as before, she would have earned exactly the same amount of money, but because her income would have been spread over several years, the amount of tax payable would have been calculated at her usual average of 27 per cent. She would have paid about $23,500 instead of the $39,000 that she was taxed. She would have been $15,500 better off. When that arises it is clearly an inequitable system. Fortunately, the Government has finally taken this on board and, as a consequence, because of the amendments before us tonight, this will not happen again. The taxpayer will be able to get a rebate of the extra tax paid. In the future tax will be deducted from such lump sum payments in arrears at a rate of 25 1/4 per cent instead of at a higher marginal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing that this package of Bills seeks to do is amend the fringe benefits tax yet again. I do wish the Government had got it right the first time. It would certainly help this place. We then would not be confronted every five minutes with an amending Bill to an amending Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Puplick's interjection on board, if for no other reason than to get it into Hansard. Let us go back to this question of getting it right. I hope that this time we have actually succeeded in doing that. This legislation removes, as from July 1986, the requirement for a crew member of an international flight to keep a travel diary so that the employer may reduce the taxable value of fringe benefit associated with overseas travel. While we are on the matter of not getting things right the first time, I understand that the Government is not planning on proceeding with clauses 45, 46 and 47 which I think is eminently sensible because I am blessed if I can see how that scheme would have worked. It tried to ensure that refunds of sales tax overpaid are available from the Australian Taxation Office to the wholesaler only if the consumer who ultimately bore the tax has been compensated for that. I am bothered if I can understand how the Tax Officer believes that the retailer can recoup from the customer that part of the price that was the sales tax overcharged in order for the retailer to not be penalising the customer and for the Tax Office to justify reimbursing the wholesaler. The whole thing is like a catherine wheel gone more beserk than most people anticipated. It would have finished up being a neat little revenue raiser for the Government without doing much for the consumer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then have some amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) applying to wrappings, thick shake mixers and accessories to take-away food containers, such as spoons. This legislation is again before us because the Government did not get it right the first time. The sales tax changes were announced in the 1988-89 Budget. They were introduced on Budget night, 23 August, and passed in the Senate on 2 November. One would have thought that even that intervening period would have given those people who drafted it time to have a last look to ensure that all the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed, but no, the legislation was apparently defective and back it comes before us. I wonder just how many mistakes the Treasury will be allowed to make. I am not sure whether this is all because public servants are not being paid enough and they are all zipping off into the private sector where they discover these loopholes and encourage people to take advantage of them. In any event, it brings back a piece of legislation which was dealt with earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I signal to the Government and the Opposition that I will be pursuing an amendment that I attempted to get through this chamber in early November. It is an amendment to the sales tax laws with regard to flavoured soya milk and to computers that have been adapted for use by disabled children. I remind Senator Messner in particular and the Opposition in general that in the debate on that amendment Senator Walsh said that the Government would wear the changes if it had to. I have not heard anything quite as definite from our generous, gentle Minister for Finance in a long time, indicating that if the Senate agreed to those changes, the Government would roll over and have its tummy tickled. Senator Messner should not be walking out of this chamber just when I am trying to convince him that somewhere down the track he has to think again about these amendments and do the decent thing by disabled children. Now he has gone. I hope he will read the Hansard tomorrow and consider the legitimacy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President; I am thrilled to know that. That is that element of the package dealt with. The final element of the package is, I think, the most extraordinary of the lot. It is the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill. The major purpose of this little exercise is to implement the May economic statement decision to reduce company tax from 49c in the dollar to 39c-to give companies a walloping 20 per cent reduction in tax. The Government is doing this at a time when it is arguing, first of all, that the economy, if it is not actually overheating now, may well be overheating, and when some Government members and certainly members of the business community are arguing that the economy cannot wear personal income tax cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also point out to the Senate that the Government is recommending a 20 per cent reduction in company tax this year whilst putting off cuts in personal income taxes, if they come at all, until next year, at a time when the average tax paid by the 200 largest companies in this country is 28c in the dollar, nowhere near the existing nominal rate of 49c in the dollar. This is also at a time when some companies are getting their tax liability down to zero-not a little bit under 49c in the dollar but the whole lot under 49c in the dollar. Alan Bond's company intends paying, and has anticipated that it will pay, nothing in tax next year. Mr Bond justifies this on the grounds that he pays tax to other countries-which is jolly generous of him but it is not doing a great deal for Australia-and that he pays rates and taxes in other areas. I remind Mr Bond, and anybody else who thinks that this is a reasonable excuse, that so do most ordinary pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers. All of us are confronted with taxes, rates and charges of one sort or another. The Government is not using this as justification for lowering the marginal tax rate or increasing the tax free threshold, nor is it allowing the same sort of tax deductibility for these items that once used to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> So some of the biggest companies in the country are currently paying very little tax. For years we watched Elders-IXL Ltd pay quite generous tax of about 10 1/2c in the dollar! Holmes a Court's company-Bell Resources Ltd-actually outdid it by about 50 per cent and contributed at the rate of 14c to 15c in the dollar. That was frightfully public-spirited of it, but it did not exactly help the Government meet the costs of expenditure in the areas on which the Federal Government should be concentrating. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we heard from those same business people-I would say that they are mostly businessmen-who are reaping the benefits of tax concessions ranging from transfer pricing, although not as much as they used to do, to negative gearing on foreign-financed takeovers, producing precious little extra production in this country? We have heard demands that people tighten their belts and, on top of that, demands that company tax be reduced. I find it rather extraordinary that those people do not support others in the community to nearly the same extent that the Government appears to support them. Why should we cut expenditure in the areas of health and social welfare? Why should we be putting a hold on PAYE tax cuts at a time when the business community is contributing precious little through the company tax system to Consolidated Revenue and getting a great deal back in the way of concessions? It is an extremely lopsided argument and shows this Government's appallingly distorted order of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> If this measure goes through, I suggest that the year after next we will be paying Alan Bond and his company a considerable amount of revenue. We will be into the era of negative taxation for some of the biggest companies in this country: companies that have no qualms about using tax havens when it suits their purposes about using a piece of legislation such as the negative gearing legislation-which was put there to encourage companies to develop, to increase employment and to increase productivity-to do nothing but increase their size and decrease their tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that the Government started to look at its priorities. As a consequence, when we get to the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill, the Australian Democrats will move an amendment which will hold off company tax cuts until such time as the rates of PAYE taxpayers are reduced by the same amount; so that, when the Government sees fit to reduce the tax contribution of ordinary wage and salary earners, then, and only then, should it reduce the contribution, such as it is, of many companies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Opposition to reconsider its stance on the gold tax and not to oppose the tax which will not, in any event, come into place for a couple of years but which will, when it does, recoup about $300m worth of revenue. I ask the Opposition to support this legislation on the grounds that the Government will have funding to redistribute to ordinary PAYE wage and salary earners, and to support the Democrat amendment that will bring company tax cuts into place only when the Government does the right thing by ordinary Australian families and increases their disposable income by reducing their tax commitment. </PARA>

Clearly, we will allow Budget Bills through because the Government was elected to govern; the Government was elected to produce its Budget.

The legislation is a mess. On 10 November, Mr Andrew Peacock in the House of Representatives spoke on these Bills when they were introduced, and they had a very speedy passage through the House of Representatives. This Government does not allow detailed, proper examination of legislation in the other place. It is simply rammed through by its oppressive majority. </PARA>

I take it badly that Senator Cook has not been called to order and told to desist from persistently interjecting. If he persists in interjecting I will retort to him, through you, of course, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I was saying, Mr Peacock said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . barely a week has passed since these Bills were introduced. That can frequently happen. But when one of these three Bills, with at least 13 changes to the income tax laws, was introduced in a package of eight Bills last Thursday night, it is almost ludicrous to think that a thoroughgoing analysis of such a complex Bill, and of the other two Bills being debated with it tonight, can be done in such a short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the central point:</PARA>
<PARA>Given this Government's poor record of slipshod and ill-considered drafting in the past, there is a likelihood that there will be numerous unintended consequences flowing from these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>`Unintended consequences' are marvellous words. How right Mr Peacock was. As I said, major elements of these Bills that were passed by the House of Representatives have been omitted from the Bills which are now in the Senate because the Government made a mess. There are more amendments to be moved tonight. Let us see how significant that mess was, how incompetent this Government is. We have seen a statement from the Treasurer dated 23 November, 13 days after Mr Peacock warned of the prospect of unintended consequences. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to amend in the Senate Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>which we are debating tonight-</PARA>
<PARA>to remove those measures which deal with the sales tax refund provisions. The existing law relating to sales tax refunds will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the Treasurer made the most outlandish and totally false statement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>These measures . . . were originally proposed by the former Government on 20 August 1981. They are designed to ensure that refunds of overpaid sales tax are available only if the person who ultimately bore the tax. (the final purchaser) has been recompensed. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the Treasurer's evidence that the Fraser Government proposed this? There is no legislation. It did not come before the Parliament. This is a typical example of someone who has been caught out making another mistake, desperately looking for someone else to blame. The Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts submissions which have been put to it to the effect that the proposals contained in the No. 5 Bill would have placed an unacceptable compliance burden on certain wholesalers and retailers. </PARA>
<PARA>What he did not say is that this secret tax would slug families. The Brisbane Sunday Mail pointed out that scores of household goods are expected to jump in price soon because of backdoor changes to sales tax laws. It gave estimates of what sort of increases would be expected in household appliances such as clothes driers, washing machines, dishwashers, irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners, ovens and so on. Was this to be done secretly or was it simply government incompetence? We have seen a fair deal of protest from the business community about the nature of this legislation which the Government is now amending because it is incompetent and because it has unintended consequences. I have received a large amount of correspondence about it. Basically what the Commissioner of Taxation appeared to be trying to do was to get the proceeds of arrangements between a wholesale manufacturer, who was also a retailer. In a very small proportion of sales which would have attracted sales taxes there may have been an arrangement which may have disadvantaged either the revenue or the customer. But this relates to 5 or 10 per cent of the transactions that are affected. To solve this problem the Taxation Commissioner and the Government have come out with the usual great mallet. They have walloped everything and everyone whether they are honest or not. The great bulk of transactions of this kind are totally honest in a very competitive market-place where, as I understand it, there is very little scope for anything that could be regarded as anything other than totally honest. </PARA>
<PARA> It was pointed out to me by one manufacturer that once upon a time retail selling prices were set on a cost plus basis but with ever-increasing competition retail prices have become market influenced. Underpayments and overpayments of sales tax now mean only higher or lower margins to the retailer. Let us face it, this is a competitive world. The only consequence that would have flowed had this tax change been passed would have been that higher costs would have had to be passed on to consumers. As the Sunday Mail quietly says, this would have involved a secret slug. The accountancy profession went along the same lines. According to a representative of Price Waterhouse, no warning had been given of this amendment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it has received no publicity nor was it foreshadowed by the Government in the 1988 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Another leading accountant said that the legislation would significantly increase selling costs:</PARA>
<PARA>This will no doubt be reflected in the pricing of their products to retailers and consequently to the final consumer . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The practical aspect of this is that tax legislation already imposes substantial burdens on a manufacturer or wholesaler in terms of ensuring that tax is correctly charged, exemptions are given proper effect to, returns are lodged and, most significantly, tax is paid on time-irrespective of whether it has been recovered from retailer customers. If this legislation had gone through in the form in which it originally passed through the House of Representatives, there would have been a further burden of proving that customers of a wholesaler, that is, the retailers, had passed on any tax credit to their customers before the tax element in a volume rebate cash settlement discount, et cetera, paid by them could be validly claimed. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple reality is that one cannot do that. The retail selling prices are set by the market. They are not so sensitive to sales tax movements. Yet the retailers demand of wholesalers and manufacturers that discounts or rebates be given to them. Under the proposed legislation, if manufacturers or wholesalers had done that, they would have lost the sales tax component of the discount rebate. Millions of dollars in overpaid sales tax would have been lost to manufacturers and wholesalers. This increase in operating expenses would have flowed into price increases and eventually into consumer prices. The representatives of the small company I was talking to about this said that it would cost them about a quarter of a million dollars and that they had no opportunity to increase their revenues but to increase their selling costs. However, this Government has no idea what the revenue impact of this would have been. In fact, the extraordinary admission in the legislation is that is is too hard to find out. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the proposed amendment is such that a reliable estimate of the potential revenue effect cannot be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have monumental incompetence. That has now been withdrawn from this legislation. In fact, I intend to move an amendment to another part of this legislation. I foreshadow that during the committee stage I will move to get rid of the retrospective element of another part of this legislation-the part relating to the packing of goods, particularly those goods which are now to be subjected to a 10 per cent or 20 per cent tax, as announced in the August Budget. The fact is that the Government made a mess in regard to this again. It did not properly include various items of wrapping that it claimed it had intended to include. One company has written to the Opposition and, I understand, taken the matter up with the Government. It is clear that the original Bill, which passed through only recently, did not amend item 92 of the first schedule. In other words, this Bill is to correct yet another blunder by this Government. This company did not apply the 20 per cent tax on its goods because this particular class of goods was specifically exempted from the legislation which was supposed to put into effect the statement made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that the Government, having made a blunder, is trying to cover up that blunder by making the provision retrospective to the date of the announcement that it intended to fix up this Bill. There is a simple proposition. If the Government says it is going to fix up some Bill from the date of an announcement, surely every taxpayer is entitled to the view that when the legislation comes out, the Government has fixed the problem as stated. But that is not so. The legislation, when it came and went through this place, did not in fact impose the tax on these particular items and so the taxpayer-the manufacturer-took the clear view, `Well, we have been exempted, so we do not collect the sales tax'. That is all very well. The Government has now said that that was a mistake; it did not mean that, and it should have been paid. For heaven's sake, what does the company do about it now? It is now December, and this was back in August. Is the company going to suffer the burden? It cannot, after the event, collect from those people who purchased the goods. It has Buckley's chance of collecting that sort of money-no chance. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to move that, rather than allow the Government to impose the cost of its mistake on Australian companies, it should have to carry the burden of its blunder, and that the legislation should operate from 3 November instead of 23 August. No doubt other members of the Opposition will deal at some length with this matter, because it is simply another example of this Government rushing into legislation having no idea what it is doing, and having incompetent drafting. Quite frankly, it is now getting to the situation where it is an exception that tax legislation in particular goes through without the need for some kind of amendment. That is simply not good enough. I think the people of Australia are sick of this kind of incompetence, particularly the self-righteous, sanctimonious nature of the Government, in its second reading speeches talking about how it is simply doing this or that wonderful thing when, in fact, it has simply been extending the volume of tax it is ripping off Australians, and using, in particular, the sales tax legislation, which it always calls `getting rid of anomalies'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That seems quite cogent. The Prime Minister said that there would be no consumption tax. Under this legislation we are getting more consumption taxes on the food that kids like, eat and want such as ice-creams and thick shakes. `Oh no', said the Prime Minister, `there will be no consumption taxes'. There is now a consumption tax on orange juice and on flavoured milk. The reality is that this kind of devious extension of the Government's sales tax legislation to food, prepackaged coffee and all the things covered in this legislation is simply part of a pattern of deception by this Government which will result in this Budget in an increase in sales tax collections of 14.4 per cent. That is almost three times its forecast inflation rate. Consumption tax, which this Government said that it would not have, is going up at three times the rate of inflation. It is going to be double the rise forecast for private consumption spending and is even faster than the huge rise of $5.7 billion in personal income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year's sales tax rise of more than $1 billion will lift the Hawke Government's main consumption tax to $8.6 billion; that is, two and a half times higher than under the Fraser Government, despite repeated Hawke promises that he would not introduce a consumption tax. In the six years of Hawke Government the 147 per cent rise in sales tax is three times the rate of inflation. It hits hardest on lower income earners, particularly families with young children who are consumers of orange juice, ice-cream and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) which provides amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930. The Bill contains 13 different and substantive changes to taxation laws. Although I wish to concentrate largely on the impact the proposals will have on the mining industry in Australia, I will briefly consider some of the other elements, which include employee share acquisition schemes, changes to the Australian film industry and tax imputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer, firstly, to the employee share acquisition schemes. I commend the Government on its decision to actually take up Senator Chaney's proposal with respect to shares and rights acquired under the schemes for the acquisition of shares by employees. This particular amendment will have the effect of excluding from assessability up to $200 per year of discounts on shares or rights acquired by an employee under certain employee share acquisition schemes. In fact, I hope that this amendment will encourage more companies to issue shares and rights to employees. This is an important feature of the industrial democracy climate that is being advanced by both unions and employer groups at present. In fact, financial involvement of employees in a company means that the employees will gain a direct benefit from increased participation and the company as a whole will hopefully have a more interested and more motivated work force. </PARA>
<PARA> An essential element in the future and in the prosperity of Australian industry and the economy is the encouragement of a common purpose and mutual interest between employees and employers. I must point out that not all employee share acquisition schemes have proved beneficial to employees. I quote a noted celebrity case whereby employees were encouraged to participate in share acquisition schemes only to find that company being taken over by a so-called raider. There was a temporary rise in the price of shares of both operations. However, during the crash the raider's shares slumped, the person had to pay tax on the benefit at the date of takeover and he was left without funds to pay his tax and was substantially in debt. So it is not without its risks. </PARA>
<PARA> The next element I wish to look at concerns research and development. In fact, clause 12 of the proposed Bill will provide for certain research and development expenditure, incurred in advance for the provision of services, to be deductible over the period during which the services were provided. In order to maintain and improve the competitiveness of Australian industry it is necessary to actively encourage research and development. So no matter how tight economic conditions may appear government and industry must be committed to research and development. I think it is important that these particular incentives have a long term implication and not a short term political benefit. Without a strong and continuing technical research base, Australian industry will flounder and the economy will continue to slide down the ranks of the world economic scale. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change affects overseas travel fringe benefits. In fact, clause 6 of the Bill provides an example of just how little care the present Government took when formulating the fringe benefits tax. This amendment will remove the requirement for a crew member of an international flight to keep a travel diary and furnish it to his or her employer so that the employer may reduce the taxable value of a property or residual fringe benefit associated with that overseas travel. I point out that it is ridiculous that a situation of this kind should have arisen in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian film industry. The Australian film industry is one which I am sure all of us here are extremely proud of, for it displays a high degree of inspiration and originality in its works. This is despite the economic constraints it faces when compared with overseas film industries. As testimony to our industry's success, a number of Australian films have been amongst the highest grossing films for the year when released in the United States of America. This Bill will make amendments to section 10b of the Income Tax Assessment Act to reduce the rate of deduction for investment in Australian films from 120 per cent to 100 per cent. The proposed amendment will have the effect of reducing investment in the film industry. This is a highly disruptive and unjust treatment of the film industry as it amounts to an estimated loss of $90m over a four-year period commencing with the 1989-90 financial year. It is vital that the Australian film industry be encouraged and nurtured as it is of cultural and international significance because of its earnings and its ability to facilitate cultural exchange and interest in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian gold industry. During the 1980s Australian gold production rose from 17 tonnes in 1980 to 140 tonnes in 1988. It is predicted that in the financial year 1988-89 production will reach 170 tonnes. In effect, this is a tenfold increase in gold production over an eight-year period. Gold is already Australia's third largest export in dollar terms, being exceeded only by wool and coal. Australia has the potential to become the free world's second largest gold producer, after South Africa, within a decade. However, this depends on the maintenance of the current favourable conditions that have nurtured the present rate of growth. </PARA>
<PARA> This rapid expansion experienced over the last eight years is the direct result of a number of factors, not just taxation implications. These factors include new geological knowledge and exploration techniques; improved mining and metallurgical expertise; the depreciation, until recently, of the Australian dollar; a steady US gold price at reasonable levels; and, importantly, the tax status of gold. There is no doubt that the tax status of gold has played a major role in the renaissance of the Australian gold industry, and that has been further enhanced by the fortunate coincidence of other factors. It has been projected that if the status quo is maintained, Australian gold production will be above 150 tonnes per annum over the next decade-over 10 per cent of the free world gold production. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the proposed amendment will lead to a downturn in the goldmining industry and associated industries and in the economy generally. It is not accurate to assert that the gold industry is tax free because tax revenue is obtained from two sources that are directly related to the gold industry. For example, tax is presently applied to gold through dividends and future capital gains. Any person who holds shares in gold pays full income tax on the dividends received from that investment. Therefore, gold industry profits are taxed in the hands of the shareholder where they are received by a resident individual. Profits that are retained, although not taxed in the period that they are earned, are reinvested to allow the purchase of new equipment, to finance research, and to permit exploration to take place. Without investment in these areas, the gold industry would not have experienced the exponential growth of the last few years. Let me repeat that gold is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of the gold tax are many. I admit that the initial reaction to the introduction of the gold tax may appear to be favourable and to the country's benefit, but I point out that in the longer term the lasting results will be quite disastrous. In the short term the mines will tend towards removing high grade ore so that the bulk of the high grade ore reserves will have been removed before the tax actually becomes operational. The period from 1991 onwards to the end of the century will obviously see gold production reduced to a predictable level of less than 40 tonnes per year. The imposition of a gold tax will transform a rapidly growing new industry into a decaying one. There will be an immediate and dramatic reduction in the level of research and exploration for new gold deposits and future gold operations will be in jeopardy. This will have significant ramifications for the gold industry, related industries and the economy in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the impact of a gold tax on exploration. It is important for us to examine this topic. A first consequence is that a gold tax will not result in increased exploration activity-quite the contrary; exploration activity will be reduced. A gold tax will effectively reduce the profit margin by half which is equivalent to a drop in the price of gold by one quarter. When profit margins start to fall, mining companies, like those in any other industry, exhibit economic rationality and start to cut non-essential costs. One of the first activities to be reduced or cut is exploration. The recent situation in the oil industry is a good example of this. </PARA>
<PARA> Mining companies explore in order to replace reserves, not to increase costs and reduce tax. The more limited the cash flow becomes, the greater the risk the companies face by devoting resources to exploration. It is important to actively encourage research and exploration for gold through the present tax system because the benefits also accrue to other areas of industry. Exploration for gold may lead to the discovery of large deposits of other valuable minerals or gems. Recently, a major diamond body was discovered and there may be other major deposits that have yet to be found. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of Tasmania gold is no longer mined as a primary source but is produced as a by-product of copper mining operations at Mount Lyell and at the silver, lead and zinc mines on the west coast. However, there has recently been a considerable amount of exploration in some areas of the State with the suggestion that some groups are looking to commence mining for gold as a primary product in the foreseeable future. At least two of those mines will not proceed if this gold tax goes ahead. If this tax goes ahead I am sure that any new efforts to mine gold in Tasmania will cease. Let me refer briefly to the concept of high grading. With the level of high grading that will persist until the tax becomes effective, what sort of gold industry will remain to support a chronic balance of payments deficit?</PARA>
<PARA> This proposal will also have an effect on social security payments. It is likely that, as a result of the tax, many of the smaller producers will be forced out of the industry as it will no longer be viable for those mines to continue. This will have the direct result of increasing the level of social security payments in some of the more remote mining areas. Many small miners are not qualified for other forms of work. In addition, they are usually living in isolated areas where there are very few alternative job opportunities. I question whether these additional welfare costs will be less than the benefit derived from the new taxation system. There is also the inequity in that while the Government is introducing taxes on gold in relation to companies under other provisions for gold explorers, individuals will still retain their tax-free status. Here we have an anomaly between the taxing of prospectors in the gold mining industry and the taxing of incorporated companies in the same industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the effect that that tax would have on our export revenue. I question whether the Government has really considered the loss of export revenue that will result from the tax and the impact that this will have on our balance of payments in the future. The main market for Australian gold at present is Hong Kong, although significant quantities are exported to West Germany, Japan and New Zealand. The gold tax will result in a reduced level of gold production. This will mean that there will be less gold available for sale on the export market, which means reduced export revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that revenue from oil exports will be on the decline in the next couple of decades. It is therefore vitally important that Australia starts to consider alternative ways of deriving export revenue from other industry sectors. From this point of view it is very beneficial for Australia to have a large and healthy gold industry during the 1990s. The dramatic growth in the gold industry has meant that there have been more exports, more jobs, greater economic stimulus for Australia's manufacturing and service industries, and more revenue for the Government. Quite frankly, it would be folly to introduce a gold tax at this stage of the industry's growth. But apart from loss to government and loss to export earners, there would be loss to other support industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides all of the more obvious direct tax effects that a floundering gold industry would have, it is necessary to consider the other needs that such a tax would introduce. In fact, there are many towns that exist almost solely because of the gold reserves found in their areas. Take for example Kalgoorlie in Western Australia that was built around the eastern gold fields. Without extensive investment in gold towns, these will be severely reduced in future. This will mean that a lot of the superstructure needed to maintain these towns will be no longer needed. There are at present gold refineries in Perth, Kalgoorlie, Sydney and Port Kembla, which refine gold bullion to 99.9 per cent purity in bars of varying weight. Less gold extracted will mean less work for the refineries and a loss of economic efficiency for the industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to dividend imputation because there are a number of amendments which provide for transitional imputation provisions from 1 January 1989. I would like to point out to the Senate a potential rort so far as dividend imputation is concerned that I believe the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) should be actively pursuing. Of late we have seen quite an increase in the number of companies issuing shares to their senior executives for perhaps a cent paid up. At the same time, they have gained the full advantage of overrated value in respect of dividends declared on those shares. This is a problem area that the Government should earnestly examine if it is concerned about stopping particularly new rorts in an area of so-called tax reform that it is so very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion: the Liberal Party does not support the amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which relate to the gold industry and its taxing. We believe that this would lead to a great reduction of that industry and have a deleterious impact on the economy of the nation. I strongly urge honourable senators to vote against this new tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak only briefly on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988 which are currently being debated cognately. I wish to address my remarks only to the proposed gold tax. I believe that Australians believe in a fair go for all. This is part and parcel of our Australian culture. Nobody likes paying taxes. Taxes can be palatable only if they are applied equally and fairly. People understandably get upset when they learn that someone such as Alan Bond, who has been paying a tax rate of only about 2 per cent for the last two years, will not be paying any tax at all for the next year. Western Australian people understandably also get upset when the Government uses public money to help the few, and especially the privileged few. The Australian Democrats believe that re-imposing a tax on gold will correct an anomaly. Business people who are not involved in gold and pay as you earn taxpayers believe that this will restore some equity to the taxation system. Certainly, small business is not given enough of a fair go. In my own State of Western Australia and in other States small businesses are going to the wall because of too many State and Federal taxes. The Government certainly should look to providing more incentives for small businesses, but this should be done on an equitable basis right across the board. The gold industry stands out as a privileged anomaly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The exemption from gold tax first became law in 1924, when the goldmining industry had declined and was in the doldrums, suffering the after-effects of wartime regulation and from an officially determined price of gold which was low; and gold has been exempt from taxation since then. A number of reports in more recent years have advocated that the withdrawal of the tax exemption for the profits of goldmining companies should take place. Some of those reports were the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation report of 1950-52; the Coombs Task Force report of 1973; and the Industries Assistance Commission reports of 1975 and 1977. Later we had the report of the Gutman Inquiry into the Taxation of Gold Mining. The Gutman report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's situation is very different. Gold production has risen at an annual rate of about 25 per cent in the past five years and next year is expected to reach its highest level in 77 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Gutman report, which was published in August 1986, in the main recommended the removal of the tax exemption and pointed out that a tax exemption did little to boost the goldmining industry for half a century, from the mid-1920s to the mid-1970s. This was a period when conditions were depressed and profits were low. As Senator Watson said, times have changed and the goldmining industry since the late 1970s has been on the rise. Senator Watson gave some of the reasons for that. One reason is the new techniques used in goldmining. Open-cut mining is used and goldmining companies are going back over land which had been depth mined previously. It is more profitable, with open cut mining, for companies to reach the seams with a lower yield. </PARA>
<PARA> Another report also advocates that gold should now be taxed as are other mining industries. I refer to a report by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics on primary industry assistance in an economy-wide context. This was released as a discussion paper in April 1988. It found that the preferential treatment of the gold industry by income tax exemptions impeded the efficient allocation of resources to other industries within the mining sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the tax exemption was a necessary incentive in the past to maintain the viability of the industry in the face of diverse factors. If it is expected to be so now, we would expect other gold-producing countries also to have a blanket tax exemption of profits on their gold industries, but this is not the case. At present Australia is the only major gold producer in the Western world which has a blanket tax exemption of profits from goldmining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that at least 35 per cent of the goldmining industry is under foreign control. Profits attributable to this sector of the industry which are exempt from taxation in Australia have for some years been taxed by foreign governments. The withdrawal of the tax exemption will only benefit the Australian Treasury at the expense of foreign treasuries. At present, if companies which currently pay tax overseas because they are foreign companies have to pay tax in Australia, they will not have to pay tax overseas because of our arrangements with other countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It will make very little difference to the larger companies which are overseas-controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> The advocates of the continuation of the tax exemption emphasise the disastrous consequences of the psychological impact of the withdrawal of the tax exemption on the goldmining industry after so long a period. However, in the past the industry and investors have adjusted remarkably well to the gradual withdrawal of tax-related concessions-such as the taxation of dividends since 1973 and the setting off of goldmining losses against other incomes since 1983-and new impositions such as the capital gains tax on the disposal of shares since 1985 and the fringe benefits tax since 1986. What is very interesting is that the goldmining industry has shown a remarkable ability, unlike others, to recover very well from the stock market crash of October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there are anomalies in the industry and that it should be reviewed, but in conjunction with other mining areas and businesses. I quote from an article in the Weekend Australian of 19-20 November by Mr John Hyde, an ex-Liberal member of Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The arguments they-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Liberals-</PARA>
<PARA>are using are nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The valid arguments against direct taxation in general should not be applied selectively to gold and are ridiculous from the mouths of people who oppose broad-based indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We can but assume that the Liberal MPs lack of concern for the efficiency of the microeconomy was in this instance deliberate. Economic efficiency was simply less important to them than a West Australian election which, because of the WA Inc. affair, the Liberal Party is already odds-on to win. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that what it is all about? He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals' underlying weakness is lack of faith. When even the most talented people do not believe in what they are doing, they become a rabble. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure that people on my right do believe in what they are doing. I have visited goldmines over the last few months because of the proposed gold tax. I was amazed at the total devastation which is being caused by the goldmining industry. I refer briefly to the Boddington goldmine. The mine is situated in an eastern area of the jarrah forest in the south-west of Western Australia. The land there is totally devastated. Because of new mining techniques, a mining company can literally carve out a whole hillside with remarkable ease. I was amazed to discover that the Boddington goldmine is an enormous hole in the ground which now has alongside it an enormous mountain of dirt. Some 75 kilograms of gold will be obtained from that mountain. The landscape around Kalgoorlie is already like a moonscape. The people of Kalgoorlie have complained for years about the sulphur emissions from the roasters of the goldmines. At last the Environmental Protection Authority has set new guidelines which show that for years people have been exposed to more fumes than is safe. To hear some honourable senators on my right talking, one would think that the entrepreneurs in the goldmining industry are there out of the kindness of their hearts. I put it to the Senate that they are there for profits, and it is only fair that profits should be taxed equitably right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years a whole host of reports have shown that there is no need, in this day and age, to continue to have no gold tax, thus creating an unfair anomaly. There are certainly areas of unjust taxation and they should be looked at right across the board. No single industry should be given any advantage over another. That encourages rorts. There is no doubt that many companies are in the goldmining industry simply for that reason. I acknowledge that that is not the case with some small companies, but let their cases be looked at equitably with those of others in the mining industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine my remarks on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988 to division 5 of the legislation, entitled `Transitional Provisions relating to Tax Concessions for Film Investment'. The purpose of this part of the legislation is to reduce the deductions for investment in qualifying Australian films from 120 per cent to 100 per cent and to remove the exemption from tax for income from such investments. This reduction was announced this year in the May statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and applies to expenditure under contracts entered into on or after 25 May 1988. This Bill also contains transitional provisions to preserve temporarily the higher rates of deduction for films substantially in production or underwritten before 25 May 1988, provided certain conditions are met. The Government says the estimated cost of the proposed amendment is $90m over a four-year period, commencing with the 1989-90 financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The area of the Income Tax Assessment Act which is being amended is what is generally referred to in the film industry as division 10ba. If one looks at the actual wording of clause 39 of the legislation, one sees that the amendment is being made to section 124zafa of the Act. The fact that the tax Act contains a section 124zafa indicates the unreal and unrealistic complexity of the taxation legislation of this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of division 10ba of the Income Tax Assessment Act is very interesting. This provision dates back to the 1980-81 period when, under the previous coalition Government, with the active support of Prime Minister Fraser and the then Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Ellicott, film concessions were provided for the first time on the basis of a 150 per cent tax concession for the original investment and a 50 per cent concession on the income earned from qualifying films. That 150 : 50 formula persisted for quite some time. Under successive governments, primarily under the tutelage of Mr Keating, that formula has been whittled down, having moved from 150 : 50 to 133 : 33-that is to say, a 133 per cent concession and a 33 per cent concession on income-then from 133 : 33 to 120 : 20, the situation pertaining before the May statement; and now to a situation of 100 per cent and no concession on the taxation regime applicable to the income from qualifying films. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early part of 1988 the Hawke Labor Government was told that there was a major crisis in the Australian film industry. It was told by a large number of people that the film industry was facing virtual collapse in Australia. It was told, for example, that the number of feature films in production by about February 1988 was zero. Whereas in the previous year 64 projects were in progress, by the time that we got to the beginning of 1988 and looked at the prospects for 1988-89 there were no films on the drawing board for that period. This was directly, as was pointed out in an article by John Stapleton in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 February 1988, `because of the Federal Government's inability to decide on a proper method of funding'. That comment was made by Mr Chris Noonan of the Australian Screen Directors Association and it was absolutely correct. We know, for example, the very great importance in an economic sense of the Australian film industry. Apart from Crocodile Dundee, which earned at least $100m last year, Australian films in 1986-87 generated something like $50m worth of foreign sales. The film industry continues to be one of the most important industries as far as creative endeavour in Australia is concerned. It is important not just as a creative industry; it is also important in terms of the cultural life of this country, in terms of the projection of the Australian image and ethos overseas and in terms of the employment it generates, not just directly for film-makers, but for actors, technicians, scriptwriters and people in the processing laboratories, the distribution network and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the whole of the first quarter of last year this Government was told time and time again that there was a crisis in the Australian film industry. The Government resolutely refused to address the problem. In February even the former Minister for the Arts, the honourable member for Robertson, Mr Barry Cohen, was warning in the House of Representatives that the Australian film industry was in crisis and that absolutely nothing was being done by the Government in response. Film-makers came to Canberra during February. A delegation came to attempt to put the case to the Government for urgent action to be taken. The Government continued to procrastinate. On 18 February, in response to the delegation, the then Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Gary Punch, put out a press statement in which he admitted that there had been a major decline in the Australian film industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The level of fund raising for film and television drama is expected to drop from $140m last financial year to between $30m and $40m in 1987-88. This decline is attributed to reductions in income tax rates which have made the tax concessions available for investment in film less attractive to investors.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the attempt of the then Minister to say that the decline had occurred because marginal income tax rates were being pushed downwards by this Government; that was why people were not investing in the film industry. That was a disingenuous attempt to cover up the fact that the primary reason for uncertainty in investment in the film industry was the Government's procrastination and its refusal to address the question of the maintenance or reduction of direct financial support through division 10ba of the tax Act. On 18 February, speaking on the PM program, Mr Punch had this to say when being asked about why there had been a major drop in investment in the film industry:</PARA>
<PARA> We always knew there'd be a problem with 10ba, with the reduction of marginal rates of tax. I don't think anyone on the Government side thought it would be this severe. </PARA>
<PARA>If nobody on the Government side thought it would be that severe, that arose only because the Government was not listening. The Government had been told consistently in the latter part of 1987 and in the early part of 1988 that the film industry was facing a crisis and that the difficulty was likely to persist. It persisted throughout the next couple of months. An article by Kathryn Bice which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 26 April 1988 made the point that only $47.09m had been secured for nine feature films, four mini-series and one telemovie under division 10ba tax concessions, which was the principal financing mechanism behind the industry renaissance during the 1980s. On 25 May, in the May economic statement, the Government made an announcement that there would be a new method of funding Australian films. This was eventually to emerge as the Australian Film Finance Corporation. The Treasurer said in his May statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an Australian film finance corporation will be established as a wholly-owned Commonwealth company to fund qualifying Australian film and television productions:</PARA>
<PARA> The corporation will be authorised to make subordinated or ordinary equity investments in film projects with a minimum overall private sector participation of 30 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I shall have cause to discuss in a few moments, that statement by the Treasurer has led to some very considerable degree of confusion. Nobody is quite sure what is meant by the phrase `a minimum overall private sector participation of 30 per cent'. They are simply not sure whether that means a participation in each funded project of at least 30 per cent or an overall private sector participation in the whole film financing scheme throughout the course of any one financial year of at least 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We were in no way enlightened by the press release put out by the former Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Punch, on 25 May-the same day. He said that the Corporation would be provided with some $70m and that `the private sector is expected to increase its stake in the industry'. Again there were no figures and we received no guidance. A hotline was established in the Department of the Arts and Territories and people were supposed to ring and ask the officers on the end of that hotline what the meaning of this new film tax concession arrangement was. I actually rang the following day to ask the officers whose telephone number was given in the press release what it meant. They had absolutely no idea what the whole thing meant. We have not been enlightened by the Government at any stage since. What we have had is the propaganda apologists for the Labor Party trying to justify all this. </PARA>
<PARA> An article appeared in the 9 June edition of the film industry magazine Encore quoting the then Minister, Mr Punch, as praising the scheme. In the Minister's words, the scheme is `a much solider commitment'-presumably the honourable gentleman meant `more solid'-`than anything else in the May mini-Budget'. With the greatest of respect, if that commitment was more solid than anything else in the May statement one shudders at just how solid anything in the May statement actually was. The article went on to say that this represented `a great coup for the junior Minister'. I was even more suspicious of this article when I saw that it was written by the then editor of Encore magazine, a commentator by the name of Irina Dunn, who now graces this chamber in a somewhat different capacity. Ms Dunn, as she then was-as the lawyers say-regarded all of this as a great coup for the Minister. We will see how much of a great coup that actually turns out to be. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Treasurer's May statement about that 30 per cent participation was the source of a great deal of confusion. That confusion has been replicated by a number of comments that have been made on the film finance arrangement. For instance, Kathryn Bice in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 25 November 1988 said:</PARA>
<PARA> To apply for corporation funds, a producer will have to secure private sector participation worth at least 30 per cent of a project's budget. The corporation may then choose to invest in or make a loan to the project provided the details of the loan pass muster. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what one might think was the purport of the Minister's statement. It is not so. I pursued that matter at some length in the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee D on 11 October 1988. We had as a witness Mr Blunn, the Secretary to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I asked Mr Blunn whether it was necessary for every single project to attract 30 per cent of private sector investment. I also asked Mr Blunn whether it would be possible that the investment would not need to be anywhere around the 30 per cent figure. On page D130 of the Estimates Committee Hansard for that date I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I was going to pick a figure of 90 per cent, actually, not 100 per cent. It could be decided that there was a compelling national interest or significance that a film, in fact, would fall below the 15 per cent, but the figure would be at the discretion of the board, somewhere between 99 and whatever. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Blunn replied:</PARA>
<PARA>It would not necessarily be at the discretion of the board. We are in fact discussing at the moment the possibility of there being an involvement of the Minister, where those provisions would be applied, but that is not finally settled. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Blunn was quite happy to admit that in fact the Film Finance Corporation could pick any figure in which it would permit private sector investment to be below 30 per cent. While Mr Blunn indicates that a general rule of thumb might be 15 per cent he also makes it quite clear that in the national interest it could be decided that the Corporation would put in 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the cost of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> I then asked whether, with the $70m allocated under this scheme, the Corporation could end up putting out $70m in the first couple of months of the year and that those projects which got in first would get the largest amount of funding. I asked whether, at the end of the year when there was virtually no money left in the kitty and somebody came along with a very worthy project, the Corporation would have to say, `Sorry, we would like to fund your film but in fact we don't have any money left'. I took issue with Mr Blunn and with Ms Santamaria from the Department about that. I asked whether people could be told, `There is no money in the kitty for the project this financial year but go ahead and make the film and we will give you the funding in the next financial year'. The Corporation would not be able to enter into any contractual arrangement but on a sort of wink, wink, nod, nod basis it would be able to encourage people to make films on the basis that money would be provided next year. In fact, both Mr Blunn and Ms Santamaria made it clear that that in fact is a perfectly correct interpretation of the way in which the Corporation could go about its business. Therefore, there is a considerable amount of difficulty in planning within the industry. For example, I said to Mr Blunn regarding the operations of the Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA>They are not in a position of saying to somebody, `We think that is a great project; we will put $5m into it. We do not have the $5m at the moment, but we will have the $5m in three months. Therefore, we give you a commitment that you will have the $5m, but you will not have it until we have it, three months down the track'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Blunn replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that that could happen. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the whole confusion which continues to attend financing in the film industry has not been resolved by this new scheme provided for by division 5 of the Bill before us this evening. The annual report of the Australian Film Commission for 1988 makes the point equally clear when it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Private sector participation in the FFC's production portfolio will be critical to achieve the production target of $120m. In its first year the FFC will be expected to secure an overall private sector level of participation of 30 per cent in its portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this level of private participation and in acknowledgment of the highly speculative character of film and television production, the FFC may subordinate its equity participation and extend a preferred position on returns to the private sector participants. Participants will be drawn from such sources as financial institutions, underwriters, venture capital investors, television networks and distributors. The degree of subordination of the FFC's equity will depend on negotiations on a case-by-case basis and the commercial circumstances of each project. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we do not have any clear indication of how the Film Finance Corporation will operate. The film industry remains in a state of crisis as a result of this confusion and lack of guidelines. Mr David Court, who helped develop the Film Finance Corporation model, was specifically commissioned by the Australian Film Commission to prepare a paper on future funding options for the film industry. On 24 October this year he was reported as criticising the Film Finance Corporation, firstly, because its establishment had been delayed and, as a result, he said, was unlikely to be able to provide funds for more than one Australian film by Christmas, that is to say, six months after its starting date. In fact he criticised the whole thing as looking simply like a revamped operation of the Australian Film Commission, whose record in this area has been the subject of some degree of criticism. Mr Court's views, which are among the most informed in the industry, ought to be taken very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me, for example, draw attention to one particular problem that has already arisen. According to the Budget, the Film Finance Corporation is to be funded to the tune of $70m in this first year. The Federal Government is at the moment being pressured by the French and German governments to provide $17m towards a $29m science fiction film called Till the End of the World. The maker of this film is a distinguished film maker, Mr Wim Wenders. He in fact has quite an established track record in Europe for making films. We know, for example, that problems arose with the certification of this film as to whether it had enough Australian equity and Australian artistic content. That was a point of dispute: the Film Commission did not believe that it had sufficient Australian participation in the actual making of the film. Mr Wenders is known for a large number of films, including the very distinguished film called Paris Texas, which showed in Australia some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the French and German governments have made representations to the Australian Government. It is believed that the West German Chancellor, Dr Kohl, made direct representations to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We know that Senator Richardson got a letter from the French Minister for the Arts, who glories in the name of Mr Jack Lang and who wrote to Senator Richardson to draw his attention to the fact that there was a possible `long-lasting negative effect on the development of film cooperation with your country, to which I personally attach great importance', and that that would be a consequence of this film not proceeding with an adequate level of public support from the Australian end. Here we have the prospect of $17m of the scarce $70m being diverted for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I am equally concerned about the fact that, once again in the best film bureaucracy tradition, the Film Finance Corporation has decided to find itself quite reasonable headquarters. It has not gone to some down-market establishment; it will have one of the most spectacular addresses in the whole of Australia. It is to have premises at No. 1 Pacific Highway for which it is to pay, according to the answer that I was provided with in the report of Senate Estimates Committee D, at least $213,942 by way of gross annual rental. One would have thought that a fairly struggling organisation, trying to look after a fairly struggling group of Australian film makers, could have found a place that would not have cost the best part of a quarter of million dollars a year in gross rent. But undoubtedly the difficulty of making these decisions will be accommodated only if one can have the sorts of views one is likely to get from No. 1 Pacific Highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is just gross rental, Senator. We do not know what sorts of orange boxes members of the Film Finance Corporation are going to be sitting on during their operations. Lastly, I wish to express my very great concern about the board and the people appointed to the board of the Australian Film Finance Corporation. The Chairman is to be Kim Williams, a person whose support for the Australian Labor Party has been public and unerring. It is to have as its part-time directors a number of people, including Mr William Gurry, Dr Patricia Edgar, Mr Jack Thompson, and Mr Anthony Hartnell, a former Labor adviser and a partner in a firm of solicitors who are also the solicitors for the Australian Film Commission. It is also to have on the board Mr Kenneth Allen, Mr James Spigelman- a name well-known in both media and Australian Labor Party circles-Miss Gabrielle Kelly, and Mr Christopher Lovell, whose experience in the film industry may be extensive but one suspects that the fact that he is a partner in a firm called Holding Redlich and Co. may be purely coincidental.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be problems of a conflict of interest in terms of who asks whom for money. Mr Williams, the Chairman, is the chief executive of a company formerly known as Taft Hardie Pty Ltd, now known as Southern Star Pty Ltd, in which role he is apparently responsible for the production activities of McElroy and McElroy, Sullivan/Oliver Productions and another as yet unnamed production entity. Mr Jack Thompson has recently announced that he is forming a film financing and production company called Pan Australian Films in association with a number of Sydney lawyers. Dr Edgar, for whom I have a great deal of respect, heads the Australian Children's Television Foundation, which one would expect to be a major applicant to the corporation for film funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I, therefore, say that I am not impressed with the extent to which the board has been overloaded with people whose responsibilities are considerable and whose qualifications appear to be just as much directed towards their active support, membership or participation in the activities of the Australian Labor Party as those of the film industry. There are on the board of the Film Finance Corporation no producers of films. There is a splattering of merchant bankers, financiers and lawyers, but the board is singularly defective in terms of people who actually produce and make films. I am extremely disappointed with the way that the board has been constituted. I do not believe that that augurs well for the operations of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Film Finance Corporation and its guidelines and operations are still shot through with an enormous degree of uncertainty. One does not know from any government statement or from any information that can be gathered from Ministers, from departments or Estimates committees, what the rule about 30 per cent private sector participation is. One does not know whether that is on a project by project basis or on a global basis. It appears to be on a global basis. That will inevitably lead to a situation in the early part of a financial year where films will be financed with a figure lower than 30 per cent of private sector investment. In other words, the corporation will put in a greater amount than 70 per cent. As a result of that, we will have a situation at the end of a financial year where private sector investment will have to be a great deal higher because there will not be money available within the $70m allocated for that year. It will mean that those who get into the system early will do better than those who come at the end of the financial year. We will have that silly scrambling for money in the film industry that was one of the worst features of the old 10ba production operations. The guidelines are not there in a coherent fashion to allow people to make planning an effective tool within the financing of Australian films in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Film Finance Corporation model will fail. It will be a betrayal of the Australian film industry. The difficulties that the industry has suffered during the early part of this year will continue to be replicated. Far from proving to be the saviour and friends of the ailing film industry, this Government and this model, introduced as a result of division 5 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1988, will be a nail in the coffin of the Australian film industry and will be to the eternal shame of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much attention has been focused in this chamber over the last two weeks on a part of the world that normally receives very little attention from politicians-namely, the Antarctic. The reason for this attention has been the tabling by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. This convention is the result of essentially secret negotiations which began in 1981. It replaces the voluntary moratorium on mining which has been in place since 1977. If ratified, the convention will facilitate the exploitation of mineral deposits in the Antarctic. The convention was opened for signature for one year from 25 November 1988; from 25 November 1989 it will be open for ratification. Sixteen of the 20 nations involved in the negotiations must sign to ratify the agreement. The 16 signatories must include the seven claimant states and both superpowers. If one of the claimant states or either of the superpowers refuses to sign, the convention will not become operative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In tabling this document, Senator Evans drew attention to Australia's primary objectives in the Antarctic. He summarised these as being: to maintain the Antarctic region free from strategic and political confrontation; to preserve Australia's sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory; to protect the Antarctic environment; to take advantage of the special opportunities Antarctica offers for scientific research; to be informed about and able to influence developments in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and to derive possible economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of the AAT. Yet we need to question whether this convention, the most recent to be negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty nations, will be in either Australia's interests or the interests of the Antarctic continent itself. It will, if it comes into force, change the nature of the continent and Australia's place in it forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of us think of the Antarctic as a vast icy wilderness, the scene of heroic exploits and great explorations. This continent, which covers 10 per cent of the world's surface, is the coldest and driest place on earth. It is a harsh and dangerous environment given to unpredictable and extreme changes in temperature; to winds of more than 250 kilometres an hour which arise without warning; and to pack ice strong enough to crush the hull of an ice strengthened vessel in minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans drew attention to the need to maintain the political and strategic stability of the Antarctic region as well as Australia's position as a claimant state. We should consider, therefore, the nature of that stability. The Antarctic Treaty was negotiated in 1959 as a result of United States initiatives. This arose from concerns about geopolitical tensions that were generated by competing sovereignty claims in the area and by a desire that was engendered by Cold War rivalries to prevent a dominant Soviet influence in the Antarctic. The Treaty, which came into force finally in June 1961, established the Antarctic as a zone of peace. The Treaty emphasised that the continent should be used only for peaceful purposes and that it should not become the scene or object of international discord. Military activities are prohibited under the Treaty, as are nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive materials there. The Treaty thus established the world's first nuclear free zone. </PARA>
<PARA> Seven states lay claim to part of the Antarctic. Australia's claim of 42 per cent is the largest. Others claiming sovereignty over the continent are New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Chile, Argentina and Norway. The claims of Chile, Argentina and Britain overlap and have in the past been a source of conflict. A further 15 per cent of the continent is unclaimed. The United States and the Soviet Union maintain a basis of claim; that is, they maintain the right to lodge a claim at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of these seven claims is complicated by the fact that they are not mutually recognised in international law by all other Treaty states or by non-signatories. Australia's claim, for example, is recognised only by New Zealand and Britain of the signatories. In turn, Australia acknowledges the legitimacy of the United Kingdom and New Zealand claims. However, the Treaty, in article 4, puts all claims on ice, so to speak, so that all parties, whether claimant states or not, are able to maintain their position regarding those claims and therefore avoid open conflict. The Antarctic Treaty system has thus become an excellent example of international cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve nations signed the Treaty in 1959. There are now 41 signatories. Twenty-two of them have decision making or consultative party status. Those parties include both superpowers and representatives of both Eastern and Western blocs, as well as of the Third World. However, the political stability that has characterised the Antarctic continent and which Senator Evans identifies as being so important to Australia will be threatened if the minerals convention comes into force. The Minister has stated that the convention was negotiated precisely in order to protect the tradition of peaceful cooperation in the Antarctic. Yet the moves towards commercial competition for resources, and especially for strategic resources, between privately owned mining companies will threaten this political stability. It is likely, moreover, that conflicts over sovereignty will arise once more, especially where those claims overlap. The resulting instability could well adversely affect neighbouring countries such as Australia. Exploitation of resources could exacerbate tensions between rich and poor nations as the former retain control over the region's resources. Australia's control over the AAT will be weakened if this convention comes into force. The pro-mining nations have already shown their strength in the negotiations for the convention. Australia's efforts to have an anti-subsidy clause written into the convention were not successful largely because of the pressure of the pro-mining nations. Should mining be permitted to go ahead, Australia would have little control over the activities of non-Australian companies mining in the AAT and would derive little benefit from such activity. In the absence of an anti-subsidy clause Australian resource industries could find themselves having to compete on the world market with subsidised ventures in the Antarctic. There would be nothing to constrain unfair economic practices in the form of a subsidy, and the way would be open for operators to commence prospecting in the Antarctic without the requirement of commercial viability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also drawn attention to the need to protect the Antarctic's unique and fragile environment. This vast continent is the world's last great continental wilderness. It plays a crucial role in the generation of stable global weather patterns and it provides a pure baseline zone for monitoring global pollution. Yet the Antarctic environment has already been threatened by a hole in the ozone layer which has probably been caused by human activities. The Antarctic ecosystem is susceptible to irreversible damage because of the simplicity of the food chain. There is little room for adaptation to change. Lichens and mosses that grow on the 2 per cent of the continent that is ice free can take hundreds of years to grow to the size of a 20c piece yet can be destroyed in a few short seconds by a careless footstep. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic environment has already suffered from human intervention in terms of the both overexploitation of marine resources-the seals, the krill, the whales and the fish stock-and the disruption of the ecological systems. The great whales are already near extinction and exploitation of krill could threaten the food source of marine mammals and thus their very existence. The bird life has to compete with human beings for the very small amount of ice free land. It has already been shown that the presence of humans has interfered with the nesting activities of the penguins in that the penguins do not tend their eggs while human beings are present. The rubbish from the scientific bases, including foodstuffs that are thrown out, machinery, metal storage drums and old tyres, has spread disease amongst the wildlife, and construction activity has already damaged the penguin rookeries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treaty, and especially the conventions negotiated by the Treaty nations, is intended to protect the environment, not destroy it. The issues of environmental protection and resource conservation have been at the forefront of the debate in the consultative meetings. A brief perusal of the reports of the consultative meetings will show that the recommendations on the impact of human activities on the environment, on the flora and fauna, on pelagic sealing, and on marine living resources, especially in the protected areas, have been a prime concern. For example, the 1964 Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna, the 1972 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources have had one thing in common: they have focused on questions of conservation and protection of resources and the environment. Unfortunately they have not always been as successful in practice as their clauses would have us believe or, indeed, as environmental organisations hoped they would be. Nevertheless, they do show that these clauses have been environmentally motivated. </PARA>
<PARA> Not so this recent convention. It breaks with that tradition in that it is an exploitative convention. If signed and ratified it will put into place guidelines that allow exploration and exploitation of minerals in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean. Protection for the environment is given scant attention. There is no provision for unlimited liability, while limited liability provisions are to be negotiated under a separate protocol. Indeed, even in the face of limited liability, one might ask: to whom could liability be directed for the destruction of the unique environment? I believe that the conservation organisations' fear is one that is justified. If the Antarctic is to be opened to mining the environment could certainly be irreversibly damaged. There is an obligation under the convention to clean up the damaging effects of mining but there are still no specific details for the rehabilitation of the environment. Yet how can such a fragile and susceptible environment ever be returned to its original state? We have only to look around us at mining in Australia to see how even a sturdy environment has suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of damage could be done to the Antarctic environment? The scraping of the ice caps along the caps of the exploratory wells could result in the uncontrolled release and spillage of many gallons of oil. A single drop of oil takes months to be broken down in the Antarctic environment. It is also of concern that an operator would not be liable, under the convention, for damage caused by an event that constituted a natural disaster that could not reasonably have been foreseen. In the Antarctic it is very difficult to predict unforeseen damage to the environment as a result of the weather. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the nature and extent of mineral deposits in the Antarctic are not yet fully known. Some say that there is virtually an eldorado to be exploited. Others say that the technological and natural barriers to removing minerals are so great that mining, if it occurs at all, will not happen until the next century. Offshore petroleum extraction is widely regarded as the form of exploitation which is most likely to occur first in the Antarctic. Deposits of offshore minerals have also been found, especially coal, uranium, copper and gold. The size of such deposits is not known and the difficulties of extracting commercially viable quantities are likely to be insurmountable, given present technological expertise. But technology changes rapidly and this may not always be the case. Exploitation of offshore hydrocarbons poses special problems. The impact of these activities could be felt far from their specific locations. For example, a major oil spill could be carried right around the continent with the prevailing Southern Ocean currents. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no adequate cleaning up techniques for removing oil from pack ice. Antarctic bird life and sea life would be vulnerable to such a spill, especially during the breeding season. Local pollution could produce changes in the sea ice which could have a significant effect on both large scale atmospheric circulation and local biological productivity. Small scale tourist activity is already having a detrimental effect. The massive logistical support required for minerals activity would only compound this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has indicated that the aim of the negotiations was not to encourage minerals activity but that they proceeded on the basis that the continent would remain closed to minerals exploitation unless a specific decision were taken to open it up. Yet once the convention is in force the strength of the pro-mining nations-the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany and Japan-is likely to prevail in the commission to be established by the convention. The pressure of those states, combined with the lack of an anti-subsidy clause, could well result in initial prospecting as soon as the convention is signed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister identified Australia's objectives as also being to take advantage of the special opportunities for scientific research. The Antarctic Treaty reinforced the work done in the 1958-59 International Geophysical Year by establishing the Antarctic as a continent for science to encourage international scientific cooperation and provide for the free exchange of the results of that scientific research. It is on the basis of scientific research that a signatory state may become a decision-making party within the treaty system. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the nature of scientific venture in the Antarctic will change if the minerals convention comes into force. There will be a refocusing of research towards exploitation technology and away from the wide range of scientific research currently being carried out. Furthermore, the results of such work would become the sole property of the operators and sponsoring states under the confidentiality of data provisions. Thus five nations could effectively lock up the scientific research resources of the continent. In a number of respects, therefore, Australia's interests and principal objectives will be undermined by this convention. </PARA>
<PARA> For the convention to come into effect Australia, as a claimant state, would have to sign. If Australia does not sign, the convention will not become operational. It has been asked: what difference would signing or not signing the convention make? If there are such problems associated with exploiting resources is it likely that there will be a rush for resources? To this I would have to say that once a set of regulatory guidelines is in place, especially without an anti-subsidy clause, the likelihood of companies beginning exploratory prospecting is very high indeed. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Australia would be able to resist pressure from pro-mining nations to open up areas for mining. Others have suggested that, if the resources are there and exploitable, mining companies will go there regardless of the existence of regulations, in which case, that argument continues, would it not be better that there was a convention? However, the voluntary restraint policy that has been in effect has worked well and could continue to do so, especially if strengthened and given some kind of formal status. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is no convention in place, mining companies would be unable to secure insurance to cover their activities there. The international political situation is also likely to continue to act as a constraint on such activities. The Antarctic Treaty requires signatories to exert efforts to ensure that no-one engages in any activity in the Antarctic contrary to the principles or purposes of the Treaty. With a moratorium still in place mining would be unlikely. Furthermore, those nations which oppose mining would regard any such action as a unilateral breach of the Treaty and that would doubtless lead to conflict. Given any internal weakness in the treaty system, the challenges to the Treaty which have been mounted by Malaysia and other countries in the United Nations would be likely to gain more credibility. None of the Antarctic consultative parties especially would wish to draw attention to such internal divisions or to encourage moves to have the control of the continent taken out of their hands and lodged with the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the alternatives? Surely it is time for the implementation of a conservation strategy to ensure that Australia's interests and particularly its environmental responsibilities in the Australian Antarctic Territory are protected in perpetuity. Such a strategy should be promoted within the Antarctic Treaty system as a whole. This wild and pristine environment should be protected and maintained in the interests of all humankind, rather than being available only to those who are able to exploit it. There is no reason why such a strategy should alter the nature of Australia's sovereignty claim or its interests or objectives in the continent. On the contrary, this would provide Australia with a unique opportunity to lead the world in global environmental protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the matter of euphemisms in language which are frequently used to cloak reality. I draw upon the work of Miss Carol Cohn who wrote a paper entitled, `Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals'. She published this paper from the Centre for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age of the Harvard Medical School. In 1984 Miss Cohn attended a summer school in Washington on nuclear weapons, nuclear strategic doctrine and a variety of associated subjects taught by defence intellectuals. Her studies continued long after the summer of 1984, however, because she found herself quite morbidly fascinated by what she discovered, particularly in this matter of language being used as a smokescreen for reality. She said that the defence intellectuals were mostly men who used the concept of deterrence to explain why it is safe to have weapons of a kind and number it is not safe to use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will quote a little bit from her paper because I think it is important to get this right. I do not want to be accused of exaggerating the points she has made. These are civilians who move in and out of government, working sometimes as administrative officials or consultants, sometimes at universities and think tanks. They formulate what they call `rational systems' for dealing with the problems created by nuclear weapons: how to manage the arms race, how to deter the use of nuclear weapons, and how to fight a nuclear war if deterrents fail. It is their calculations that are used to explain the necessity of having nuclear destructive capability of what George Kennan has called `levels of such grotesque dimensions as to defy rational understanding'. At the same time, it is their reasoning that is used to explain why it is not safe to live without nuclear weapons. In short, they create the theory that informs and legitimates American nuclear strategic practice. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the particular language used to discuss missile systems, we see that Miss Cohn became so hooked into the system which she saw operating that she coined a new word. She called this specialised language `techno-strategic'. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have come to believe that this language both reflects and shapes the nature of the American nuclear strategic project, that it plays a central role in allowing defense intellectuals to think and act as they do, and that feminists who are concerned about nuclear weaponry and nuclear war must give careful attention to the language we choose-whom it allows us to communicate with and what it allows us to think as well as say. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the all-pervasive nature of the situation in which Miss Cohn found herself. The language reflects the thinking and that is where some of the danger lies in legitimising and accepting that nuclear deterrence is a reasonable position for any human being to hold. She talked about the world of these defence intellectuals being somewhat bizarre; bizarre because it is a world where men spend their days calmly and matter-of-factly discussing nuclear weapons, nuclear strategy and nuclear war. The discussions are carefully and intricately reasoned, occurring seemingly without any sense of horror, urgency, or moral outrage. In fact, there seems to be no graphic reality behind the words as they speak of `first strikes', `counterforce exchanges' and `limited nuclear war', or as they debate the comparative values of a `minimum deterrent posture' versus a `nuclear war-fighting capability'. She said that this extraordinary language was used to legitimise the whole concept of nuclear war and preparations for nuclear war. She said it was an elaborate use of abstraction and euphemism, of words so bland that they never forced the speaker or enabled the listener to touch the realities of nuclear holocaust that lay behind the words. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has seen pictures of Hiroshima burn victims or tried to imagine the pain of hundreds of glass shards blasted into flesh may find it perverse beyond imagination to hear a class of nuclear devices matter-of-factly referred to as ``clean bombs''. ``Clean bombs'' are nuclear devices that are largely fusion rather than fission and that therefore release a higher quantity of energy, not as radiation, but as blast, as destructive explosive power. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Clean bombs'' may provide the perfect metaphor for the language of defence analysts and arms controllers. This language has enormous destructive power, but without emotional fallout, without the emotional fallout that would result if it were clear one was talking about plans for mass murder, mangled bodies and unspeakable human suffering. Defense analysts talk about ``countervalue attacks'' rather than about incinerating cities. Human death, in nuclear parlance, is most often referred to as ``collateral damage''; for, as one defence analyst said wryly, ``The Air Force doesn't target people, it targets shoe factories''. </PARA>
<PARA> Some phrases carry this cleaning-up to the point of inverting meaning. The MX missile will carry ten warheads, each with the explosure power of 300- 475 kilotonnes of TNT: one missile the bearer of destruction approximately . . . 400 times that of the Hiroshima bombing. </PARA>
<PARA>Ronald Reagan called the MX the `peace keeper', which totally denies the destructive power of that weapon. A nuclear submarine was perversely called `Corpus Christi', the body of Christ. I find it hard to believe that such is the nature of euphemism in the defence planning community. Miss Cohn further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Feminists have often suggested that an important aspect of the arms race is phallic worship, that ``missile envy'' is a significant motivating force in the nuclear build-up. </PARA>
<PARA>Opposition senators may well laugh. They should listen further; they will be rolling in their seats in just a moment. I advise them to take this seriously because it reflects the underlying thought patterns that pervade the minds of the people who sit and plan the use of nuclear weapons. Carol Cohn said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have always found this an uncomfortably reductionist explanation and hoped that my research at the Centre would yield a more complex analysis. But still, I was curious about the extent to which I might find a sexual subtext in the defense professionals' discourse. I was not prepared for what I found. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting here verbatim because, as I said, it is important that I am not accused of exaggerating. There are the words of a person who sat and listened to these people and who made a detailed critique of what they said. She states:</PARA>
<PARA> I think I had naively imagined myself as a feminist spy in the house of death-that I would need to sneak around and eavesdrop on what men said in unguarded moments, using all my subtlety and cunning to unearth whatever sexual imagery might be underneath how they thought and spoke. I had naively believed that these men, at least in public, would appear to be aware of feminist critiques. If they had not changed their language, I thought that at least at some point in a long talk about ``penetration aids,'' someone would suddenly look up, slightly embarrassed to be caught in such blatant confirmation of feminist analyses of What's Going On Here.13</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I was wrong. There was no evidence that any feminist critiques had ever reached the ears, much less the minds, of these men. American military dependence on nuclear weapons was explained as ``irresistible, because you get more bang for the buck.'' Another lecturer solemnly and scientifically announced `to disarm is to get rid of all your stuff.'' (This may, in turn, explain why they see serious talk of nuclear disarmament as perfectly resistible, not to mention foolish. If disarmament is emasculation, how could any real man even consider it?) A professor's explanation of why the MX missile is to be placed in the silos of the newest Minuteman missiles, instead of replacing the older, less accurate ones, was ``because they're in the nicest hole-you're not going to take the nicest missile you have and put it in a crummy hole.'' Other lectures were filled with discussion of vertical erector launchers, thrust-to-weight ratios, soft lay downs, deep penetration, and the comparative advantages of protracted versus spasm attacks-or what one military adviser to the National Security Council has called ``releasing 70 to 80 per cent of our megatonnage in one orgasmic whump.'' There was serious concern about the need to harden our missiles and the need to ``face it, the Russians are a little harder than we are.'' Disbelieving glances would occasionally pass between me and my one ally in the summer program, another woman, but no-one else seemed to notice. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a lot more. If honourable senators are interested in getting a copy of this paper I will be pleased to provide it to them. Miss Cohn went on to detail bizarre experiences she had while involved with this defence course, like being invited to pat a missile, usually a sign of affection as one pats loved ones like children or dogs: pat a weapon with fondness and, presto, its lethality disappears. There is another section headed `Fathers, sons, and virgins', another on male birth and creation, another on God and the nuclear priesthood, with lots examples of language being used as a shield against reality. Miss Cohn's analysis of the power of euphemism, to put it mildly, where life-destroying weapons are concerned is worrying, because those of us who want to challenge the military planners' thinking to a certain extent have to use their language in order to understand where they are coming from and to have any credibility in the eyes of our adversaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In case honourable senators think that this is all absolutely far-fetched and removed from our backwater here in Australia-removed from the planning of megadeaths; thankfully that is so-I draw their attention to an article in, I think, the Canberra Times at the weekend entitled `Sleazing on with the Cordies of Legoland'. The translation is: life with the officer cadets at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADF). There is actually a dictionary of Lego lingo. It can be found in both the Australian National Library and the Defence Academy Library. Tony Wright, in this very interesting article in a weekend newspaper, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is probably fair to say that it would be the most vulgar dictionary in any library in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a language created by a tightly-bound sub-culture of young men who see themselves as separate and possibly superior to those in the outside world. They are driven by urges common to most groups of young men-urges sharpened by the tough discipline of the academy to the point that much of the language revolves in the sphere of escapist fantasy. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Those whose sensibilities are tender should probably not read on, because Lego Lingo is not for the faint-hearted. For a start, it is sexist, profane and racist in the extreme. Indeed, the language appears to display enormous contempt for both women and Asians, among others. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote the puerile language used by the Cordies of Legoland, but I wanted to draw attention to this subculture. We learn a great deal about their outlook on life from the language used by the Cordies of Legoland. I think that the Lego lingo dictionaries are a fair warning that racism and sexism are alive and well in the ADF Academy, which I think is regrettable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently the Senate has witnessed a remarkable and regrettable series of allegations against individuals by members of the Opposition which are pushing the bounds of simple decency. Typically, people against whom such allegations are made are helpless to defend their good names publicly. So I seek to redress one of these miserable attacks against a constituent of mine, Peter Ross, of the Fitzroy River region in the Kimberley, Western Australia. The pattern is familiar: a set of circumstances is identified, a senator-in this case Senator Crichton-Browne-leaps to the worst possible conclusions and, on the basis of his own hostility towards certain communities and people, proceeds to attempt to destroy a reputation in a wholly unprincipled way.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is unforgivable calumny of a good, generous man, most of whose life and much of whose resources have been devoted to enhancing the quality of life and dignity of his black friends and relatives to whom, incidentally, Senator Crichton-Browne refers as if they were half-witted incompetents. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be technical deficiencies in accounting procedures amongst some of these remote and isolated communities in the Kimberley and elsewhere. On the whole, they are managing their book-keeping remarkably well. One of the great satisfactions of the last few years has been to see young Aborigines acquiring accounting and computing skills and becoming very competent in the way in which their funds are being administered. Of course, every responsible parliamentarian insists upon proper accountability and I am no exception. However, one needs to travel the region with humility and compassion to comprehend just how devastating has been the effect of Europeanisation upon the traditional owners of the land. Consider the naked contempt and hostility repeatedly shown not only towards the Aborigines but also towards those who work with them. Let us not forget, or forgive, the role of the Liberal Party of Western Australia in such episodes as Noonkanbah and Turkey Creek, and the appalling abuse of electoral law, not to mention morality, exposed by the Court of Disputed Returns not so many years ago. Perhaps the Junjuwa, Kalumburu, Balgo and Wangkatjunka books are not meticulously kept. They should be-I am not defending any lack of competence there. However, internecine rivalries in the area are not unknown. Many of the assertions made suggest considerable ill feeling, which is hardly a basis for such wide-ranging accusations. </PARA>
<PARA> This I do know: Peter Ross has put far more into the well-being and development of the Fitzroy communities than he could ever have taken out of them. His history is that of a guide, counsellor and mentor; a rough, tough and forthright champion of the Aboriginal right to dignity and self-determination; a down-to-earth, practical person who resolves problems as they arise, in the harsh and beautiful Fitzroy region, with the wisdom of his decades of experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from a recent article by Jerry Pratley in the West Australian. I am not asking the Senate to take my word for this, though I happen to know Mr Ross and people who have worked closely with him for many, many years. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ross-</PARA>
<PARA>when made aware of the accusations-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . said that he was so well respected by the Aboriginal community that he was the only white man in the Kimberly allowed to take part in circumcision rites. </PARA>
<PARA> He had worked to overcome alcohol and juvenile problems in the town, had fostered 18 Aboriginal children through his own home and helped find good jobs for each of them. </PARA>
<PARA> A Fitzroy Crossing police officer who did not wish to be named said he `could not say a detrimental word' about Mr Ross. </PARA>
<PARA> `He takes juveniles, young fellows that are running off the rails, into his house all the time and straightens them out,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> `He's a good man, a real good-hearted man. We think he's a bloody good bloke and he doesn't tell lies. </PARA>
<PARA> `He's always running around taking them (Aborigines) out to the communities because he knows that if they stay in town they get on the drink. </PARA>
<PARA> `He'll drive 300 kilometres to take a load out to one of the communities then be back 10 minutes and there will be another mob that need taking the other direction.'</PARA>
<PARA>I greatly deplore the tendency which has arisen here to get into Hansard, and often on the air, allegations which in many cases are very wide of the mark and sometimes quite unsubstantiated, but which leave the individual with very little in the way of redress. I am glad to have this opportunity of putting on the record my feelings about Mr Ross and his contributions to Aboriginal communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my contribution I must say that I think Senator Giles's double standards cannot be taken seriously until she remonstrates with Senator Peter Walsh regarding his bottom drawer labelled `dirt' with the same enthusiasm with which she has attacked Senator Crichton-Browne tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to deal with the Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA), an organisation which has just lost $1 1/2m. I have not seen in the media any announcement that it has lost $1 1/2m. Perhaps it is not the sort of announcement that this Government seeks to make, but behind the annual report of this organisation there is some kind of financial disaster which I think the Government owes it to us to explain. </PARA>
<PARA> This organisation has set out on a massive expansion program at the same time as the Government is cutting its funds. I notice that under section 8 of the Trade Union Training Authority Act the Authority must comply with any directions given by the Minister for Industrial Relations. The report says that the Minister gave no such directions to the Authority this year. Apparently, it set out on a massive expansion program without having received any Government instruction to do so, resulting, as I said, in a loss of $1.5m compared with a profit of $103,000 in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, by reading the annual report one would not know that. One has to read in detail the accounts at the end of the report before one finds out what is really going on with this extraordinary organisation. The report is full of excitement and expansion and positive comments. The year produced, it says, a very substantial growth in the volume of training carried out. It says that the number of student training days increased to 60,462-a growth of 20 per cent over the previous year. It says that the number of participants attending courses increased by 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This great concentration on expansion and the positive things that are happening is all very well, except that it does not tell anything like the full story. TUTA says that it is further extending the development of individual courses relating to individual enterprises, with the appointment of a number of national industry training officers who will liaise with unions at a national level to develop more closely coordinated industry-based programs at the colleges and centres. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me in particular is, firstly, why TUTA is doing all the things that it is doing and, secondly, why it has lost so much money. Certainly there are large question marks over many of the things TUTA does. For example, the report says, regarding the provision of information kits, that materials in the report Australia Reconstructed `have been prepared both in the form of kits to assist training staff and as handout material for course participants'. I remind the Senate that Australia Reconstructed is a discredited Australian Council of Trade Unions document full of absolute nonsense-which this Government, for example, has basically ignored and rejected-about what the ACTU sees as some kind of approach for Australia. The Trade Union Training Authority is apparently so under the control of the ACTU-which is funded, of course, by Australian taxpayers-that it trots out this line. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of some concern that most of the people attending TUTA courses are public servants. Public sector attendances totalled 54 per cent of those who attended TUTA courses last year. That raises the serious question of who pays for these public servants while they are attending these courses. Of course, it is the good old Australian taxpayer. I wonder what sort of hidden or additional costs exist, because that particular cost does not appear in the report here. However, the report does say that it regrets that the Australian Government has cut its grant. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of grave concern to the Australian Council therefore that cuts in TUTA's allocation have been enforced for 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>They did not take place in the year covered by this report when it lost $1.5m. The cuts are for 1988-89. The consequences of that are very clear: either TUTA has to find other ways of making a large amount of money or there has to be a massive reduction in its activities. It would be interesting if the Government would come clean and say what is going to happen. It is interesting that the Council sees an immediate need to increase the number of people trained to 30,000 a year which, I must say, involves a considerable increase in the number of people being trained at present. Perhaps the Government and TUTA can come clean and tell us how they are going to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of coming clean I really want to look at TUTA's accounts. After the loss of $1.5m its fixed assets-its non-current assets-are no longer covered by its capital accumulation. In other words, it has had to borrow money which is now invested in its buildings, plant and equipment and so on, which is a reversal from the previous situation. There have been massive increases in many of the costs involved. For example, expenses have gone up from $8m to $9m, although its revenue has fallen from $8.8m to only $8m. The taxpayers of Australia who fund this Authority have every reason to request a decent sort of explanation. Why, for example, did TUTA have investments of $1m anyway? What were these investments? These investments, by the way, have been sold. TUTA has had to call on $447,000 of cash in hand to cover its $1.5m loss. What were these investments and why was there a loss on their disposal? These are questions that someone in TUTA or in this Government-if they care-might be prepared to let us know the answers to. </PARA>

As Senator Puplick says, it is remarkable that a report such as this, which is clearly misleading and which leaves an enormous number of questions unanswered, comes out only after we have dealt with the appropriations for the Department of Employment, Education and Training.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Puplick said, it was buried in the 33 papers. It is also disheartening to see that, while the Trade Union Training Authority put out this pap, Australia Reconstructed, as part of its training kits, these publications were put out at a loss of $50,000. Perhaps people were reluctant to buy that sort of garbage. That might explain why it has suffered that kind of loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many other matters to be raised. I am wondering why, for example, debts outstanding for more than three months have doubled during the year. I am wondering whether TUTA should not apply the same success that it has to running its bar account to its other activities. In fact, it managed to make a profit of $5,879 on its bar trading which tended slightly to offset the $1.5m loss on its total activity. Unlike the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, TUTA appears to know how to run that end of the business. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an appropriate comment from Senator Puplick. The other thing that I think is well worth noting is that in the Senate Estimates committee hearing I did in fact ask some questions about TUTA, about the extraordinary manner in which it keeps changing the location of the office of the National Director. When this organisation started, I think back in the Whitlam years, its headquarters, and those of its director, were in Wodonga. I have to say that under the Fraser Government that then changed to Canberra. Under the present Government it moved to Sydney, and it has now been moved to Melbourne. I am wondering when Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane will get a look in as the headquarters of TUTA. Every time that organisation moves it costs squillions of dollars. At the Estimates Committee hearing I asked why on earth this move took place. I was assured that there were sound economic reasons that involved efficiencies and cost savings of some substance. I then asked for an indication of those. The reponse stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Melbourne premises of the new national office are larger than the Sydney offices of the National Director. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose they should be because the national office encompasses quite a few other things. The reply continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Office now incorporates the national administrative function previously located at Wodonga-</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that the Clyde Cameron College still remains at Wodonga, so the central training operation is now removed altogether from the administration-</PARA>
<PARA>and in addition provides a base for a group of national industry training staff. </PARA>
<PARA>All this was at a cost to TUTA in 1987 of approximately $20,000 per year less than the cost of the Sydney premises of the National Director alone. This was seen as a compelling economic justification of the decision to locate in Melbourne. The departmental officer then goes on about the operational point of view and so on and how important it was for the office to be nearer the Department and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, presumably to get its political instructions from both the Minister and the ACTU. What was not said in the response appeared in footnote No. 17 to TUTA's accounts where it was revealed:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . several staff were retrenched-</PARA>
<PARA>because of these moves; because of restructuring-</PARA>
<PARA>during the period . . . This involved total expenses of $333,019 and included payment for accumulated entitlements plus amounts totalling $193,493 pursuant to a redundancy package . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not extraordinary! That amount of $333,000 is that cost which is glossed over and does not appear in the reply given to me about the economic benefits of moving. That was the cost of making that move and of making those amalgamations and stream- lining the operation. I can only hope that this extraordinary rapidity of moving offices ceases because, quite frankly, it seems to be taking far more money overall than this organisation appears to be able to make, even out of its bar trading. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to the fact that this organisation has also been in breach of a requirement that it must obtain ministerial approval prior to entering into contracts involving payments of amounts exceeding $100,000. The Attorney-General's Department this year has advised TUTA that this provision should be interpreted to include contracts involving investments of funds. I do not know why it should not have in the past. However, in the light of this the Authority has been advised that the provisions of paragraph 47 (a), which require this kind of approval, were breached during 1987-88 on a number of occasions. I do not know what the consequences of those breaches were. But it is worth noting that the proceeds of disposal of non-current assets, presumably the assets which involved breaches of this requirement, involved a loss of $24,000. I think in the circumstances, having made a loss, having breached the requirement of the guidelines, there is an obligation on this organisation to explain what on earth it has done and why it has done it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters of major concern in this report which I will not respond to tonight, except to say that it is clear that TUTA is facing a financial crisis. It cannot continue at the same rate of loss because it does not have any more investments to dispose of to cover a loss of $1.5m. It does seem that the Government has an obligation to say firstly to TUTA itself, and secondly to the taxpayer, who has been funding this organisation at enormous cost each year, just what on earth is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in the light of comments made by Senator Giles, who vigorously sought to defend one Peter Ross, whom I had cause to refer to some little time ago in respect of the finances of the Aboriginal communities in the Kimberleys. I thank her for bringing to my attention the newspaper to which she referred. Whilst I would not bother to refer it to the Committee of Privileges I see that Mr Ross, in response to my comments, was reported in the paper as having said, `I will bare knuckle the bastard one handed'-intimidating stuff. That frankly sums up the point that I made. I understand that is typical of Mr Ross's conduct and that is the type of conduct that Senator Giles is seeking to defend. It is symptomatic of the complaints I have had about Mr Ross by a number of Aborigines in the north west, not the least being young people, who are mindful of the fact that he happens to be for the moment, for better or worse, a justice of the peace (JP), and who have been threatened by him to the effect that because he is a JP he will deal with them in his own way. On separate occasions he has threatened them physically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make it clear to Senator Giles, who does not seem to have the facts at her fingertips, that I was not making allegations about Mr Peter Ross; I was referring to documents, not the least being an audited report to members of the Wangkatjungka Community Inc., and it was that impartial auditor who claimed in his statements that Mr Ross had misappropriated funds, that he had taken food for his own benefit and booked it to the community, that he had flown at least twice to Derby by charter and booked it to the community, that he had taken 34 cartons of beer and booked it to the community and that he had booked up items of equipment for his own home and charged them to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the auditor, and not I, who referred to the fact that the gross profit of the store was 8 per cent during the period when Mr Ross was a project officer, and drew the conclusion that goods were being paid for but not received, stolen from the store, or not correctly paid for and the moneys banked. That was the proposition put to us by the auditor. The auditor made the point, and not I, that when Mr Ross was in charge of the community the level of consumption of diesel fuel went up in the cooler months, when the air-conditioners were not being used, and decreased in the hotter months when the air-conditioners would have been used. It was the auditor, and not I, who claimed that Mr Ross was paying Mr Alan Lawford as the powerhouse operator during March, April and May, when Mr Lawford was not a resident at Wangkatjungka. It was the auditor, and not I, who made the point that a separate person, the primary school teacher at Christmas Creek, was being paid by Mr Ross for doing the actual work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the records of the Association that show that Mr Ross drew $7,355 in his own name and in his own handwriting on Wangkatjungka cheques, for his own personal loans. It is the records that show that Mr Ross returned no more than $800. The records of the community show that a further $12,192.20 was drawn in cheques in Mr Ross's handwriting, for which there is no satisfactory explanation. There are certainly no receipts, no invoices, and no benefits for the community. It is the records-and not I-that show that on six occasions there was overpayment in wages. On one occasion it was $40, on another occasion $180, on another $180, on another $40, on another $180, and on another $500. The significance of that is that the wages are paid to illiterate Aboriginals in cash and the cheques are drawn and cashed by Mr Peter Ross. I draw no conclusions as to where the difference went or who got the difference of the overpayments, but that is what the records show; it is not my claim. That was under Mr Ross's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The complaints about Mr Ross's conduct do not come from me. The first comes from the Chairman of the Kimberley Land Council, writing to Mr Clyde Holding, who was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed to us by various Aboriginal communities in relation to Mr Peter Ross, Project Officer Junjuwah community. We have been informed that on a number of occasions he has accompanied mining companies on visits to other communities in an advisory capacity to the mining companies. He has also visited communities advising them not to have dealings with the Kimberley Land Council. We do not consider that these activities would fall within the normal duties and responsibilities of a project officer. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of Mr Peter Ross acting as an agent for the mining companies is that he was getting paid for it. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> It is our understanding that Project Officers are funded to assist communities in mechanical and practical day to day tasks. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that was a fair definition of duties. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that Mr Ross is using his position in Junjuwah community and that he is maintaining his position by unacceptable practices. We feel that the community may need assistance from your Department to deal with a situation which is detrimental to the interests of the community. The Kimberley Land Council is concerned that all Project Officer positions be reviewed regularly by DAA, and representatives of other Aboriginal organisations, particularly where reports of improper conduct have been alleged. </PARA>
<PARA> We require urgent action to investigate Mr Ross's conduct and interference in the affairs of other communities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty straightforward from the Chairman of the Kimberley Land Council, who, I would have thought, would have had the best interests of the Aboriginal community at heart and would have been inextricably and intrinsically tied to the Aboriginal community in the Kimberleys. </PARA>

<PARA> The other correspondence I will raise tonight is that to Mr Clyde Holding, former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, from the Chairman of Marra Worra Worra, Fitzroy Crossing:</PARA>
<PARA> Re: Project Officer's Position-Wangkatjungka Community-Xmas Ck</PARA>
<PARA> An extremely serious situation exists at Xmas Cr whereby the outgoing Project Officer from the Junjuwa community, Fitzroy Crossing, has been lobbying intensively-with another community's resources-for the Xmas Cr job . . . In the course of this lobbying, Aboriginal organisations and resource personnel have been maligned and slandered. </PARA>
<PARA>This is about the Mr Peter Ross who was defended tonight by Senator Giles. The Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra group says:</PARA>
<PARA> In the best interests of community development, we are hopeful that all the applicants for this job will be given an equal chance to present themselves to the community so that an informed decision can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peter Ross has been telling Wangkatjungka people that he already has the job-seriously jeopardising people's sense of power in the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> His Junjuwa job has been neglected while this lobbying has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman then proceeds to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Serious discrepancies occurred at previous Junjuwa elections whereby young children were rounded up and encouraged to vote for Mr Ross' candidate. Rifles and cars are used to currie favour with key people . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At one night meeting called by Mr Ross, it appears that an attempt was made to install a new community chairman without many key community members being present-including the existing chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The feeling in Fitzroy Crossing is that the community is being divided up, confused and exploited for this individual's personal gain. </PARA>
<PARA> It also appears Mr Ross is associated with a Western Australian company called Can Aussie which offers a consultancy service for mining companies. Old men are taken up in planes and asked to sign releases for mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious errors have been made using this method. Kim Akerman-</PARA>
<PARA>I will quote the people just so that we can get it on the record-</PARA>
<PARA> or Peter Bindon of the Museum of Western Australia can be contacted for details-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, if Senator Giles bothers-</PARA>
<PARA>John Clark-Liaison Officer, Department of Mines, can be contacted for confirmation of his mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Community morale is very low at present. Please give this matter your urgent consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ross has been waging a concerted and highly public campaign to thrust himself onto the community in recent times in the course of which I have borne the brunt of his criticism. In the course of this campaign I would not be surprised if Mr Ross makes a direct approach to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) as he has threatened to do and has done in the past. That is the conduct of Mr Ross, as described by the Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra Association. As I say, the previous correspondence was from the Kimberley Land Council. I believe that the record sits. Nothing that Senator Giles said tonight has changed that, or will change that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention the policeman that Senator Giles made something of tonight. The article states:</PARA>

If this peremptory dismissal of allegations made not by me, but by others as outlined, were to be found to be the standard depth of findings and conclusions by the Western Australia police force, then one would have cause for grave concern. The truth is that I know that not to be the case and I find it all the more disappointing that gratuitous comments of that nature would be made of an officer of the Western Australia police force in the face of substantial evidence in respect of such serious allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to question seriously how such an officer would conduct himself in the event that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs concluded on the evidence presented that a prima facie offence had been committed. I just wonder whether that officer would write on the file, `We think he's a bloody good bloke and he doesn't tell lies,' and close the file, or could we expect a proper inquiry by this officer? My view is that his comments are stupid, ill-formed and gratuitous and they reflect very unfairly and improperly upon his colleagues. I hope that that is not how he conducts himself in his normal course of investigations. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Will he bring up-to-date the information contained in the answer to question No. 2438 (Hansard, 19 August 1986, page 5) concerning Army Reserve training allotments, and provide similar information from 1979-80 for the RAN Reserve and the RAAF Reserve.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The current advertising campaign continues to address both the recruitment of the Army Reserve (ARes) and the retention of the ARes. In the case of RAN Reserve, no national campaign is conducted but each Port Division can advertise in local media to fill specific billets. RAAF Reserve does not advertise nationally and can maintain strength by offering Reserve positions to selected permanent RAAF who have elected to take their discharge. RAAF Reserve sometimes advertises in local media to fill unskilled positions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Army has indicated that the campaign will need to continue if ARes strength is to reach its revised strength of 26,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Actual expenditure on the ARes campaign to June 1988 was: FY1985/86-$2.623M, FY1986/87-$2.562M and FY1987/88-$2.55M.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) Market Force (previously called Creative Oasis) of Sydney devised and implemented the campaign. MOJO-MDA Pty Ltd are the booking agents for clearing media and MPS Advertising Pty Ltd are the booking agents for magazines and newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The total cost of the campaign for FY1988/89 is $2.856M which includes Special To Unit (STU) advertising of $0.5M.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The net monthly change in ARes strength since the campaign began is shown in the following table. RAN Reserve and RAAF Reserve strengths vary from nil up to 30 people each month.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The target strength of the ARes remains at 30,000 however an interim target of 26,000 has been allotted as a minimum to meet current operational tasks. RAN Reserve has a target strength of 1,954. RAAF Reserve has a target strength of 1,500.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) High rates of wastage in the ARes have caused the primary target of 30,000 to be unachievable in the shorter term. The interim target of 26,000 is expected to be achieved by June 1992 if wastage can be kept at or below 6,700 per annum. The RAN Reserve target should be achieved by June 1993; RAAF Reserve by January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) ARes strength has exceeded 30,000 on several occasions. The most recent being July 1981 until June 1984. The advertising campaigns of FY1985/86 to 1987/88 slowed and then reversed the underachievement that commenced in 1984. In conjunction with the campaigns, Army has improved administrative/management procedures for processing recruits and has raised Recruiting Units in each state. Positive benefits are resulting from integration of the ARA and ARes where more Regular Army members are joining the ARes when they elect to take their discharge. The targets and upper limit of the ARes are the same but with the interim target of 26,000 in force until June 1992 unless the target is achieved earlier. Both RAN Reserve and RAAF Reserve expect their targets to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The projected active ARes strengths as at 31 October 1988 are set out below. The recording of personnel as efficient/non-efficient occurs as at 30 June each year with some delay before all results are received.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Active ARes-24,666 comprising: Efficient-17,181; Non-Efficient-2,972 and not recorded-4,513.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 26,000 by June 1992 or earlier.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 26,000 by June 1992 or earlier. The current strength of the RAN Reserve is 1,408 and the RAAF Reserve is 1,353.</PARA>
