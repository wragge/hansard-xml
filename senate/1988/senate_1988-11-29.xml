<TITLE>In-vitro Fertilisation Patients: Medicare Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce aware that today's Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures show that capital expenditure by manufacturers in the September quarter of 1988, at $1.67 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, was 3 per cent lower than for the same period last year? Is it also a fact that overall investment expectations for the current financial year have been revised downwards? Does the Minister agree that this investment scenario does not augur well for Australia's productive capacity and its ability to become truly internationally competitive, as the Minister himself last week said was the test that counts? I further ask the Minister: When will the Government stop its self-congratulation and take action to change those many elements of the economic environment which put Australian business at a disadvantage against international competition?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3056" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Chaney does not expect me to answer the last part of the question, because international competition is dependent on various factors in various countries just as any sense of competitive advantage here is dependent on particular factors. So I decline to make that comparison at Question Time. However, I appreciate the point of the honourable senator's question. If I might say so, I think it would be premature to start talking about a downturn in investment activity. It is true that the ABS September quarter figures released today record a drop of 2.9 per cent which follows five successive quarters of increasing capital expenditure levels. Despite the decline in the September quarter, investment expenditure overall was 8.2 per cent above the level a year earlier. Moreover, the September quarter result is based only on preliminary data and is prone to substantial revision. I suspect that Senator Chaney will know that the preliminary results for both the March and June quarters of this year were also negative but that revised figures confirmed that positive growth had taken place in each of those quarters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The revised 1987-88 outcome shows that in constant prices total investment in that year rose by 9.8 per cent compared with 7.2 per cent in the previous year; investment on plant and equipment rose by 8.3 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in 1986-87; and manufacturing investment overall rose by 9.3 per cent in the year. At the same time, expectations data from the same ABS survey-this is one that Senator Chaney referred to-revealed that business investment growth is expected to be extremely strong in 1988-89. Those figures confirm the Treasurer's Budget projection of a real increase in business investment of around 12 per cent. I conclude by saying, as I have said on other occasions, that there is no cause for complacency in those figures but I think there is no cause for optimism on behalf of anyone-I am not putting Senator Chaney in this category-who would wish to say that they were serious.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I thank the Minister for his answer but I would like to ask a supplementary question on that curious part of his answer in which he referred to international competitiveness being dependent on particular factors and declined to comment. I ask the Minister: Is he aware that Australia's inflation rate is very much out of line with the rates of our international competitors at 7.3 per cent, being about double the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, nearly double that of the United States, about 15 times that of Japan and six times that of Germany? Is he aware that nominal wage rises are running at 6 per cent in Australia compared with about half that in the United States and Japan and just over half that in Germany? Is he aware that prime interest rates in this country are very high on any international comparison? Does he accept that they are all relevant matters-indeed, there are many others; for example, the condition of our transport system and waterfront-which go to the capacity of Australians to be internationally competitive, as he is constantly exhorting them to be? What is the Government proposing to do to change these fundamentals, which are so much to the disadvantage of Australian manufacturers and other investors?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, let me say that I agree with Senator Chaney's figures in terms of the inflation rates in various countries, but in his supplementary question he gave a classic example of what I mean when, for example, he singled out increases in nominal wage rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to Taiwan. Let me say that, in terms of both industrial relations and wage rates, the Taiwanese economy has become less competitive in the last six months. In so far as Senator Chaney mentions other questions like the transport system, the waterfront and so on, the Government is addressing those issues. Solutions are not going to happen overnight. We have said that on a number of occasions. We expect the inflation rate to be down by the middle of next year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of reports that Australians, including, I think, Senator Vallentine, intend participating in a regional peace brigade to the Philippines for approximately one month from late December to protest or demonstrate against United States military facilities there. Philippine authorities have expressed concern to our Embassy in Manila on two counts: firstly, that violence could be provoked at the demonstrations in order to embarrass the Philippines Government; and, secondly, over the possibility of contact by Australians with illegal groups in the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to remind people that travel in parts of the Philippines can be dangerous and to reiterate the existing consular travel advice that has been put out by my Department with respect to the Philippines which advises Australians to avoid inessential travel to the areas surrounding the Clark air force base and the Subic naval base and also reminds Australians that contact with proscribed organisations in the Philippines, including the Communist Party of the Philippines, the New People's Army and the National Democratic Front, makes them liable to prosecution under Philippine law.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has also made it clear to the Philippine authorities that the Government looks to them to ensure that forces under their control do not exceed their authority in enforcing applicable Philippine law. I think it is also prudent to remind those Australians who enter the Philippines on tourist visas that any breach of the provisions or the conditions on which these visas are issued could result in action being taken against them by Philippine authorities. I have no intention whatever of questioning the right of Australian citizens to express their views on issues of concern to them. However, they have a responsibility in their own interests to ensure that their participation in public demonstrations in a foreign country is within the laws of that country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Attorney- General been drawn to the article in today's Sydney Morning Herald concerning the involvement of Wardley Australia Ltd, to the tune of over $160m, in the original Rothwells Ltd rescue plan? The article mentions that `Wardley executives who contacted potential investors stressed the Government guarantee, and that as the State was installing its own managing director, contributors would be supporting virtually a semi-government authority'. As it was on this basis that a number of Australia's largest companies agreed to contribute to the Rothwells rescue plan, is the Government concerned to see this aspect of the Rothwells affair investigated by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC)? As the implicit and explicit guarantees by the Western Australian Government were likely to form part of the marketing of the Wardley financial package, will the NCSC examine this deal to determine the authenticity of the guarantees and the way they were used and promoted to persuade parties to agree to the rescue package? Given this new development, and the fact that corporations and small shareholders alike invested in Rothwells on the strength of the Western Australian Government's guarantees, will the Government reconsider its position and call immediately a royal commission into the entire Rothwells affair?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Government will not be reconsidering its decision at the moment in relation to the question of Rothwells and the proper investigations that might be undertaken in relation to its collapse. I have not read the article concerning Wardley Australia. So, I am unable to comment on the contents of the special article to which Senator Messner referred. I must say, as I said only yesterday in this chamber, that the National Companies and Securities Commission has undertaken to conduct an investigation under section 36 of the relevant legislation. I believe that gives the National Companies and Securities Commission sufficient and adequate powers of a wide ranging kind to summon witnesses, to require production of documents and to take evidence on oath. That will well place it to carry out the sorts of inquiries that are required in light of the fact, as Mr Bosch himself indicated, that the NCSC has reason to suspect that offences, being offences under the companies and securities legislation and offences that involve fraud or dishonesty or concern at the management of Rothwells Ltd and companies associated with it, may have been committed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a most serious situation. The National Companies and Securities Commission clearly believes, at the moment, that it has sufficient power and scope under section 36 to undertake a proper and adequate investigation. The fact is that the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities, as I mentioned yesterday, meets later this week-I think in Canberra. I have no doubt that Mr Bosch and his officers will be reporting to the Ministerial Council in relation to this matter. Obviously it would be at the Ministerial Council that the adequacy of this particular approach could be determined.</PARA>

Did the Minister read a letter from Duncan Bell, the Executive Director of the Australian Gold Mining Industry Council, to the Editor of the Australian Financial Review, which letter was published this morning, admitting an inequity between the present treatment of income derived from the mining of gold and income derived from other sources? What is Mr Bell's proposed solution to this inequity? Will the Government be adopting it? What are the implications of this proposal for revenue and, in turn, outlays?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a letter in the Australian Financial Review today with Mr Bell's name on it. I also saw on Saturday a full page advertisement, I think it was in the Sydney Morning Herald, with Mr Bell's name on it in which he was lobbying for another group, the superannuation industry. I note for the record that Mr Bell anticipates his disemployment because the question of the special tax break for goldmining will, of course, be put to bed forever within a couple of months. Mr Bell will no longer have a job. He is now working as a lobbyist for another tax break industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today's letter said:</PARA>
<PARA> Because the dramatic expansion of the Australian gold mining industry has been promoted by the current taxation system applying to the industry, what the gold miners are now saying to the Government is you've got the system right on gold mining.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bell continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If you want both equity and industrial growth, use this system as a proven model for the basis for reform of the general corporation taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Bell is saying that corporate tax should be abolished. Whatever case there may be for the abolition of corporate tax does not apply to the total exemption from taxation of extractive industries like goldmining. This is something that I notice even the Queensland Government got right because it imposes a significant tax on goldmining, notwithstanding its pontifications about the inequity of the Commonwealth Government doing the same thing. The implication of the abolition of corporate tax is that more than $10 billion would be lost to revenue in this financial year, which is almost 12 per cent of Commonwealth revenue and more than 12 per cent of Commonwealth outlays. So, to maintain the same degree of fiscal discipline, it would therefore be necessary to cut outlays by 12.4 per cent.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chaney" NAMEID="EF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does that take into account the extra income tax that would be paid? Is that a net or gross figure?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a gross figure. If one accepts that it is not possible to cut outlays on public debt interest, defence pensions, all personal benefit payments and the financial assistance grants to the States and Territories, that would require cutting 41 per cent of all other Commonwealth outlays-which I suggest is an absurd proposition. Further to Senator Chaney's query, if all company income were distributed as dividends the loss to revenue after the time lag of probably a year would not be all that great. But, of course, it is not all distributed as dividends and there would be a year's time lag in any case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the Liberal Party has sided with the tax bludgers on this issue and has taken the view that the present policy should be maintained in perpetuity, I would be interested to hear the ideas of Senator Chaney, Mr Peacock or Mr Howard about whether the logic in the goldminers' argument should be extended to its conclusion; that is, the abolition of all corporate taxation. If the Opposition is going to advocate that, I would be interested to hear what adjustments Dr Hewson proposes to make on the outlays side of the Budget in order to maintain the same degree of fiscal discipline.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the Minister aware of a survey of Australia's leading corporations conducted by the Australian newspaper which showed that Australia's six largest corporate borrowers between them owed $26 billion-equal to more than 23 per cent of Australia's gross foreign debt? Does the Minister agree that the increasing preference for raising capital through debt rather than through equity is due to the fact that debt is cheaper because it is tax deductable? Will the Minister provide an estimate of how much tax revenue has been lost since 1984 because private companies are allowed to claim their foreign borrowings as a tax deduction?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3059" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the survey; that is the answer to the first part of the question. In response to the second part of the question, I think I have made this point in the Senate before but it is worth making again: fashions change. In the 1960s it was a bilateral political position in Australia-it would even have been trilateral had the Australian Democrats been around at that time, I suggest-that we should restrict the amount of foreign equity, particularly in large mining projects. Given the limited size of the capital market, it then followed inevitably either that mining projects would not proceed or that they would have to have a high gearing ratio. They proceeded in the main on money borrowed from foreign banks. That was held-particularly, probably, by the `Left' of Australian politics-as being a very appropriate policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the 1980s, however, the fashion had been completely reversed, and equity was to be preferred to debt-especially foreign debt. My own view is that there is something to be said for that, because a country which has a high level of foreign debt is more exposed than one which has a high level of foreign owned equity. If there is a downturn and the foreigners own equity, the foreigners go without their dividends. But if they are owed loans they continue to collect their interest. For that reason, I think that our exposure to foreign debt, as distinct from foreign equity, has made us somewhat more vulnerable. That was particularly the case in 1986. I do not know what is the cost to revenue, if any, of the conversion of equity to debt. I doubt whether there are any reliable estimates, but I will ask the Treasurer about that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Do the national income and expenditure accounts published today by the Australian Statistician show that in the September quarter, on the basis of seasonally adjusted figures, real gross domestic product grew by only 0.3 per cent? Do those same accounts show, however, that during the same period real gross national expenditure grew much faster than real national product-in fact, by 1.7 per cent? Since the difference between national spending and national production represents the extent to which Australia is living beyond its means, has the Minister noted that in the September quarter our imports of goods and services therefore grew by no less than 8.3 per cent in real terms, whereas our exports grew by only 0.7 per cent? In view of the various misleading claims by the Treasurer that the rise in imports over recent months relates to an upsurge in private business investment in new capital equipment, has the Minister noted also that these same accounts show that in the September quarter private fixed investment in equipment fell by 3.2 per cent in real terms? Further to that point, has the Minister also noted that the preliminary results of the Statistician's most recent quarterly survey of private new capital expenditure intentions, which were also issued this morning, show `a lower than usual increase in businesses' expectations between the June and September quarters' surveys . . . ' and that `this is particularly so for expenditure on equipment'? In the light of the disastrous balance of payments result previously recorded for the September quarter, has the Minister also noted that that result occurred, as we are now told, notwithstanding that the national accounts figures published today also record that `Australia's terms of trade improved by 5.8 per cent in the September quarter'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could give a very short answer and say that I will take the question on notice but I am sure that Senator Stone would complain if I were to do that. I had a very quick look at the September quarter national accounts.

I did not see the figure for gross national expenditure, but it is implicit in some of the others--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button tells me that the anticipations were misquoted; I did not look at those. There is an apparent discrepancy that is not uncommon with quarterly national accounts or even annual national accounts in that, as Senator Stone said, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth figure for the September quarter was recorded as 0.1 per cent which is, I suggest, impossible to reconcile with the employment growth during that period. The employment growth figure is much more likely to be reliable than the quarterly national accounts of GDP growth. I would be surprised if at some time that figure at least for GDP growth during the quarter is not revised substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to private investment, the statistics do not disaggregate the extent to which imports of capital equipment contributed to the private investment that took place. I suspect that the investment figure might be revised upwards at some later time as well, but even if that does not happen it does not necessarily follow that the imported component of capital equipment investment has fallen just because the aggregate has fallen.</PARA>
<PARA> On the more general question about economic policy or macro-economic policy, we have just been through a year in which Australia has recorded the first Budget surplus in the 35 years since reliable statistics have been kept-a Budget surplus of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The surplus forecast for this year is 1.7 per cent of gross domestic product. If one cared to extrapolate the Commonwealth Financial Transactions (CFT) report for the month of October for the whole 12 months-and I am not suggesting that it should be done in that simplistic way-one could come up with a Budget surplus of the order of $9 billion this year and not the projected $5.5 billion. I am certainly not suggesting that it would be $9 billion but I would not be surprised if it were somewhat more than $5.5 billion at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a fiscal policy of unprecedented tightness for Australia, not by a small margin but by an enormous margin. A couple of weeks ago I was speaking to a senior executive of one of Australia's large companies. I put the question to him, `If anybody had asked you three years ago whether there would ever be a Budget surplus in Australia, let alone a surplus of the size that we have, and such a tight fiscal policy, would you have believed it?'. He said, `Heavens no, nobody would have believed that a few years ago'. I believe that is correct. My response to the theme which Senator Stone and some others in the Opposition continually run with-that fiscal policy is too slack-is this: how much tighter do they want it to be?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, relates to the planned shipment of spent nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights to be undertaken by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). How does the Minister explain the obvious conflict of interest in this case, which arises from the fact that ANSTO is both the client plus the independent regulatory authority advising the body responsible for checking that the LHRL cask complies with relevant standards and regulations? Given the lack of expertise in Australia, apart from ANSTO, does the Minister intend appointing an independent and qualified inspector from any other source to check the ANSTO cask and to investigate the current claims of poor design and manufacture? If not, why not? What are the relevant qualifications and experience of the Department of Transport and Communications officers responsible for approving the design of the cask, who approved their appointment to carry out this task and what qualifications and experience did the authorisers have? Finally, did the inspectors check the LHRL cask against the design plans on its arrival in Australia? What is the nature of the inspection and handling trials now being undertaken?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has been the subject of some press comment and I have been waiting with bated breath for 10 days now for Senator Vallentine to come back to the Senate and ask this question. First of all, the Department of Transport and Communications is the competent Australian authority under the appropriate international code, which is the International Maritime and Dangerous Goods Code, relating to the sea transport of all hazardous materials from Australia, including radioactive materials. In relation to structural aspects of standards under the code for the spent fuel cask, qualified Department of Transport and Communications engineers-that is, qualified under the code-have vetted the cask design and have confirmed that it meets the design criteria, as has the United States Department of Transportation. ANSTO has no regulatory responsibility in respect of the cask so there is no conflict of interest there, as implied in the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission was consulted by the United States Department of Transportation in relation to revalidation of the Australian certificate of approval and assurance of a competent authority certificate. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluation of the safety analysis report prepared by the designers drew attention to three design assumptions relating to one accident test situation and stated that large margins exist between the stress calculations and the design criteria. So the combined corrected calculations would not significantly reduce the shielding effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> The style of media reporting of this event draws unwarranted attention to a few items taken out of context. For example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that the cask meets the applicable requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations and recommended that the certificates be issued. There is no reason to have any further independent inspection. I just make the point, because it has also been the subject of newspaper comment, that some casks have been withdrawn from use in the United States. They are old ones designed and built years ago. This is simply an example of updated safety requirements being applied.</PARA>
<PARA> The implication in some press reports and in Senator Vallentine's question is that the ANSTO cask is similar to old withdrawn models in the United States. That is entirely wrong. The ANSTO cask was built to current standards and was completed only this year. It was checked against the approved design by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, at the request of the Australian Department of Transport and Communications, before it left the United States. Officers of the Department of Transport and Communications and ANSTO are continuing to undertake a series of performance and acceptance tests, such as vacuum leak testing, and to familiarise relevant ANSTO staff with the handling of the cask and its associated specialist tooling.</PARA>

Since the Minister has now accepted all of the Opposition's proposals in relation to the south-west forest areas of Tasmania, the right of Tasmania to veto any further World Heritage listing, logging in National Estate areas, and the expertise of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission-all of which he has previously promised never to do-and since he has now broken every single promise he made to conservation groups on these questions, does he not feel that the decent thing to do would be to resign as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and freely admit that Senator Cook has at last comprehensively rolled him on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick for his question. I was asked whether I received a letter from some Tasmanian senators. I get many letters from Tasmanian senators. I recall one in particular concerning Huon Forest Products and its export licence in Tasmania. While I cannot recall the details of the letter-and I do not have the letter with me-my memory is that a number of Tasmanian senators in that letter, and in discussions with me, expressed concern about resource availability and whether there were sufficient resources in the Tasmanian forests for Huon Forest Products to get a guernsey. That was a pretty reasonable concern to express.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last few months my Department and Senator Cook's Department have spent a lot of time and effort examining those resource figures. It is true to say that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has also spent a fair bit of time in the last few months trying to prove up those figures. When Senator Cook and I spoke to Premier Gray a couple of months ago on this question he too could not prove up the resource figures for Huon Forest Products and wanted some time to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of all those efforts from the Tasmanian Forestry Commission and the two departments concerned, we were able to get some agreed figures on the Tasmanian resource. I must say that the figures on the Tasmanian resource were somewhat higher than I had expected them to be. That is because techniques have been improved and because we were finally able to gain access to a great deal of material which had hitherto been kept from us. I think that is a good sign. At least this argument has made sure that Tasmanians have had to produce figures and come clean.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as to the rest of Senator Puplick's question, I find it absolutely extraordinary that he would have the gall, the hide, to say that we have adopted the Opposition's policies. I have listened to this rabble for months scream and yell about how we should not World Heritage list anything in Tasmania. For months I listened to it, and still they go on now. As is pretty well known, the Cabinet decided on protection for a very significant proportion of Tasmania's tall eucalypts, after many hours of debate. The task was then given to Senator Cook and me to negotiate with Tasmania to come up with a result, and we have done so. However, I will not have the privilege of announcing it now because, along with Senator Cook, I gave an undertaking to Premier Gray that the two--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the first point to make is that I certainly have not broken any promises to the conservationists in Tasmania. I told them I would seek and gain protection for a vast area of tall eucalypt forest and I have done so. That was their prime concern and I have delivered on that promise, unlike Senator Puplick, who stated that he would not proceed to do that unless the Tasmanians agreed. One thing I can reveal is that the Tasmanians did put up something of an argument on this question last night for hour after hour. But, of course, unlike Senator Puplick, we will not bow down, and we did not. We have kept those tall eucalypt forests protected. That is something he could not and would not do. Just by the way, when it comes to getting rolled in Cabinets, in the shadow Cabinet Senator Puplick has yet to have a win. Not only was he rolled in the shadow Cabinet, which I would hate to admit, looking at who is in it; he was even rolled by Senator Bishop.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Depo-provera is marketed in Australia and approved for treatment of certain cancers. It is also used as a long-acting contraceptive injection that is effective for several months. However, it is important to remember that depo-provera is not specifically approved for use as a contraceptive. But, as it is marketed, there is no legal impediment to prescribing it for contraceptive purposes. This means that those receiving it should be very aware of its status as an investigational drug and that consent for its use, preferably in writing, should always be obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of organisations around Australia, such as the Victorian Coalition against Depo-provera and the Family Planning Association, have expressed considerable reservations about the overuse of depo-provera, particularly in Aboriginal communities. To this effect I wrote to the Queensland Minister for Health. I had received a number of complaints from Queensland about the overuse of depo-provera in remote communities, particularly Aboriginal communities. Mrs Harvey said that the matter had been investigated and that she was advised that a modest number of women, mainly but not only Aboriginal or Islander women, in north Queensland currently are receiving depo-provera every three months for contraceptive purposes, the drug being prescribed by medical practitioners and patients being counselled about the use of the drug and its possible complications. She advised that until recently verbal consent was obtained from the patients prior to administration of the drug but that it is now usual to obtain written consent. I am certainly pleased to hear that written consent is now usually-she uses the word `usually'-obtained. I think we should ensure that all medical practitioners obtain that written consent.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by Dr Blewett that the Chairman of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee has agreed to seek new data from the drug's manufacturer and plans to consider that information, as well as information provided by a number of other groups, such as the Family Planning Association and the Victorian Coalition against Depo-provera, to reassess the drug's current status as investigational. Furthermore, the ethics of prescribing an investigational drug are being considered by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. It has recently agreed to prepare ethical guidelines to address the circumstances of prescribing an investigational drug in situations other than an outside, controlled clinical environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian women who have any reservations about the prescribing of depo-provera should ask themselves and their doctors whether those doctors would prescribe depo-provera for themselves, in the case of female doctors and whether they would prescribe the drug for their wives or daughters. There certainly is considerable concern about the way in which this drug has been used, particularly in relation to Aboriginal communities, Islander communities and other communities in remote areas where perhaps there is not the same necessary awareness of its investigational status.</PARA>

Secondly, can the Minister also confirm that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) has ceased testing long range ballistic missiles in the Pacific? Thirdly, given that the Government opposes any trade-off between Soviet bases in Vietnam and American bases in the Philippines, does the Government foresee any circumstances in which foreign military bases are removed from the Asia-Pacific region?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I think I have said before, the Government welcomes the various indications, including those contained in the Krasnoyarsk speech, that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is seeking more constructive involvement in the Pacific region. Our own position on the kind of arms control disarmament proposals that are emerging is shaped by three basic considerations. The first is that the north Pacific is second only to Europe in terms of deployed military capability. Secondly, there is no established framework for security negotiations in this region. Thirdly, these issues are of direct concern to regional states. Our own proposals, such as they are, in response to these concerns and considerations, have essentially been confined to urging greater transparency and greater dialogue on security concerns. This represents starting at the beginning. I do not pretend that any more elaborate set of prescriptions has yet been worked out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of our response to specific questions raised by Senator Macklin, as to the sea-launched nuclear cruise missile deployment issue, the nuclear freeze proposal was outlined in the Krasnoyarsk speech. The proposal not to increase the amount or the number of any nuclear weapons in the region was a noteworthy one. We acknowledge it as such. The difficulty about it, particularly in the context I have just mentioned of the cruise missiles, is that it is essentially unverifiable in character, to the extent that the SSN21 can be fired from torpedo tubes and could be deployed on most submarines. That is a fundamental flaw in any disposition we might otherwise have to take at face value that particular part of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second question about the USSR having ceased testing long range ballistic missiles in the Pacific, we are not aware that the USSR has declared an end to testing such ballistic missiles into the Pacific, nor in fact that it has stopped doing so. To respond to the third part of Senator Macklin's question, we see no advantage in speculating as to the circumstances in which foreign military bases might be removed from the Asia-Pacific region. As to the fourth part of Senator Macklin's question, which asked whether we support the indefinite presence of the United States of America in the region irrespective of whether the USSR stays at Cam Ranh Bay, I suppose we say that the United States presence in the Asia-Pacific region is essentially a matter for the United States itself to resolve with the countries concerned. In so far as the question specifically intended to refer to United States bases in the Philippines, the clear Australian view which I, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence have spelt out on numerous occasions is that these bases are important to giving a sense of security to countries of the region. Our clear preference would be that they remain, which is a preference which is manifestly shared by the Association of South East Asian Nations itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reply to the second part of Senator Chapman's question first. It is undeniable that what the Government is doing in implementing the Child Support Agency, and the principles behind that, is essentially and primarily to raise the living standards of a whole host of children in the community who otherwise have been neglected by the non-custodial parent. I think it is quite understood, if not on the other side of this Parliament then at least generally in the community, that those children have been neglected and that the mechanism the Government is putting in place is very important in terms of alleviating poverty in this sector. Also, we should understand not only the complexity of the scheme that has been introduced but also its magnitude. We estimate that, without restrictions, 200,000 additional persons could very well be eligible for maintenance collection in the initial year of operation. We should also understand that we are working with State and Territory governments and their collection agencies, and the Government has stated quite a number of times that we will gradually bring those agencies under the ambit of the scheme over a period of at least 12 months. It is estimated that these agencies are currently collecting about 50,000 liabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 November Senator Newman asked me a question on Army personnel serving with the United Nations forces on the Iran-Iraq border. I have an answer to that question. Members serving with the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) are currently receiving a United Nations mission subsistence allowance. That allowance is $A197 a day for the first 30 days and $A185 a day thereafter. Although it is known in broad detail what the allowance covers, more precise details are being sought to enable a decision to be made as to whether supplementation through an Australian allowance should be introduced. In addition, a case is being developed for a disability allowance package. This could include a post allowance at the rate applicable to all government employees serving in Tehran. In addition, there could be elements to cover additional disabilities of service in the field and the hazardous nature of the duties. Evidence to support the case is still being collected. The decision on the overall package to be provided rests, of course, with the Minister for Industrial Relations. Both the initial outlay advance and the special outlay advance provided to UNIIMOG members must be repaid, as is normal in these situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The intention is that the package of allowances developed to cover service with UNIIMOG be paid while the duty is in progress, although this may be difficult to achieve for the first team deployed because of the lack of lead time before the group was sent overseas. Considerable delays have been experienced in obtaining sufficient information to support the proposed package of allowances. Communications with Iran are poor and the Australian United Nations military observers are fully occupied in their primary task, impeding data provision. However, additional information has recently been provided from Iran, and it is hoped that this will allow at least an interim decision to be made on the field element of the disability package. Every effort is being made to provide allowances for UNIIMOG members in the shortest time possible consistent with the requirement for responsibility in adopting new allowances. However, I repeat: the 15 Australian members of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group are currently receiving the United Nations mission subsistence allowance.</PARA>

<PARA> I apprehend that the discussion before the Committee of the matter of the Household Expenditure Survey of the Bureau of Statistics has left members of the Committee and other Senators with something of an incomplete impression of the part played by Senate officers in the examination by Senators of the survey. In order to correct any misapprehension I would like to place the following brief statement among the records of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Certain Senators asked me to examine the question of whether the Household Expenditure Survey could be a compulsory survey in view of the fact that no proposal for the survey was laid before each House of the Parliament. I passed this request to Mr Peter O'Keeffe, Clerk-Assistant (Procedure), whose duty it is to provide advice on legislative matters to non-government Senators. He composed a brief memorandum indicating a view that failure to table a proposal prevented the survey being compulsory, and recommending that, if Senators wished to take further action, a further opinion be obtained. This memorandum was provided to the Senators concerned, and they requested a further opinion. The further opinion was obtained from Professor Douglas Whalan, and made available to the Senators. That opinion reached much the same conclusion as Mr O'Keeffe's. At the request of the Senators concerned, other aspects of the question in issue were examined by Mr O'Keeffe and Professor Whalan, and further opinions were obtained and provided to the Senators.</PARA>
<PARA> That was the extent of the involvement of Senate officers in the matter; they have done no more and no less than provide advice on legislative matters to Senators. They have not participated in the political controversy about the survey, contrary to some highly coloured press reports.</PARA>
<PARA> At page C139 of the Hansard transcript of the proceedings of the Committee there is reference to my correspondence with the Australian Statistician, Mr Castles, being provided to the Committee. As I do not know what correspondence has been provided, I think I should now present to the Committee a full set of copies of all the correspondence, and this full set of all copies is attached. I have included in the copies one letter to a Senator to indicate that an intention expressed in a letter to Mr Castles had been carried out.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to comment on the seventh annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. I refer to some comments made in the Chairman's report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of exports has revitalised the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the recent spectacular export success, Australia's share of world trade in wine is still less than 1%. The potential for further export growth is enormous providing quality is maintained, the value of the Australian dollar enables our prices to remain competitive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Many primary industries are in the same boat. The Chairman also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's decision, announced in May 1988, to reduce Export Market Development Grants payable to the Corporation and industry poses an added obstacle to increased promotional effort. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we take note of the fact that reduced government support has been a worry to the Chairman of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. By the same token, it is very interesting to note the huge expansion of exports in that industry. For instance, there has been an increase of about 226 per cent in such exports to the United Kingdom. In the pecking order of major importers of Australian wine, Sweden is by far the biggest importer, followed by the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Denmark and the Netherlands. It is very pleasing that a press statement appeared in the Australian to the effect that wine exports have doubled and now total a record $100m. I am sure that the Government must be pleased with that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 16 of the report there is a section entitled `Wine Inspections'. It refers to the panel of 18 wine inspectors which inspects the wines that are to be exported. It is unfortunate that press releases have come to note in the last week or so about a so-called wine scandal. It reeks of the so-called meat export scandal. A very well know winegrower in the Hunter Valley was quoted in the Hobart Mercury of a day or so ago as saying that his business has been brought into disrepute and that a mountain was being made out of a molehill, which is a shame. Reference was made to the fact that his wines contained sorbitol as an additive. It is unfortunate that this matter has been blown out of all proportion. I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of John Stanford in today's Australian when he said it was `pointlessly destructive' to our export industry. I know John personally. He is a wine judge of great repute and I was very pleased to be involved with him in the Royal Hobart Wine Show a couple of weeks ago when he and a panel of very well known judges, including Dr Max Lake and Colin Richardson from South Australia, took part in the judging. I know they would be very disappointed because they are very proud of Australia's export industry and the very good wines Australia is bringing forward. It is most disturbing to see that this type of thing can happen. It can do quite a deal of damage to the efforts of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the wine producers of Australia in exporting one of the finest ranges of wines in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few seconds remaining I would like also to comment, without being too parochial, on the section about Tasmania. The report said that Tasmania's wine grapes harvest for 1988 broke all previous yield records. Quite naturally, Tasmanian wines are known world-wide to be of a standard that is among the best in the world. It proves once again that one does not have to be big to be good. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak to the review of the activities for 1987-88 of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Review `88 covers many important issues. I believe that it will be a very useful report as a source of reference for basic information in this area. Two of the changes that occurred during the period 1987-88 to which I would like to refer are the decentralisation of some services and the business migration scheme. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Structural changes to the Department's Central Office in December 1987 followed a decision to devolve most casework to State and Territory Offices. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, since that time there has been a decentralisation of a great many services. This decentralisation has involved a lot of the activities which were formerly carried out only from Canberra and which are now carried out in the capitals of the various States. It has also meant that some of the services have moved away from central business districts and are now more accessible to clients in local suburban areas. I must say that in my own home State of Western Australia I know from personal experience that this has made a lot of difference to the clients in this area. The report refers to Western Australia on page 161 where it states:</PARA>
<PARA> There were continuing signs, as the year developed, that immigration workloads in the State Office in Perth would increase at a greater rate than any other single office of the Department in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This trend confirmed the reality that Western Australia proportionately has the largest migrant community. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to turn to the subject of business migration, which is covered at some length in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Migration Program seeks to attract people with a proven business background who intend to settle in Australia and who will use their skills and capital to establish ventures of benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Procedures for processing applicants whose background and potential clearly meet the program objectives have been streamlined. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987-88, a number of independent Australian business organisations and consultants were appointed as Accredited Business Migrant Agents . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of such initiatives and continuing promotion overseas, Business Migration Program numbers have continued to climb. In 1987-88, visas were issued to 7387 people . . . The main source countries were Hong Kong (788 cases), Britain (169), Malaysia (165), Singapore (86), Indonesia (55) and Japan (67). </PARA>
<PARA>Be that as it may, there have been a lot of concerns expressed about the business migration scheme and these have been highlighted in the press and particularly in articles put out in the Sydney Morning Herald by the journalist Margo Kingston. There are some details that I think would be cause for grave anxiety. For example, the Sydney Morning Herald ran an article on a seminar held on business migration, at which the director of business migration in the Western Australian Government's Exim Corp., Ms Lesley Maher, warned that monitoring was vital. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we will then stop the recycling of the $500,000 [where a migrant sends back his $500,000 for someone else to use to get their visa], and the failure of business migrants to go ahead with what they propose in statements of intent. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is stated in the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Anna-Maree Osborne, a partner in Overseas Business Ventures Australia, says the revolving $500,000 rort happens ``a lot''. She said a Chinese agent in Chinatown lent migrants $500,000 for a month at 30 per cent interest to get in. And an Indonesian client sent his $500,000 back home on the advice of his Australian bank manager. ``He was told it was stupid to keep it here and pay tax, and to send it back to Indonesia until he really needed it,''. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia has encouraged business migrants to put their half million dollars in an investment trust for up to five years until they start in business and during that time they are given free advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The various migrant groups in Australia have expressed grave concern about the business migration program. They feel that the migrants coming out under that program are not necessarily the sort of migrants who will make a go of it in Australia and that schemes, such as the family reunion scheme, under which migrants come out to join members of their own family and are determined to settle and make their lives here, are much sounder in the long run. I do not think that Australia really can afford to bring in people who are here merely to exploit us. I am well aware that not all business migrants come into that category, but I feel that privatising the scheme is not in the best interests of all Australians. It should be looked at and reviewed as fast as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to speak today to the annual report 1987-88 of the Australian Sports Commission and I think anyone with any interest in sport at all might be well advised to have a look at this report. It is very comprehensive, understandable and well presented. The foreword points out that the report is presented in accordance with the Australian Sports Commission Act 1985. The Commission's principal objectives are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to encourage the private sector to contribute to the funding of sport to supplement assistance by the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to provide leadership in the development of Australia's performance in sport; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to encourage increased participation by Australians in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>Through the pages of this report we can see the number of ways in which those objectives are being very adequately and comprehensively met. The area that I particularly want to pick up is women in sport, but I note in passing the Aussie Sports program which I have spoken about in this place and strongly endorsed. Some 500,000 young Australians are now registered as participants in that program. I think that is very commendable, particularly as that program was introduced not only to encourage children to try their hand at a lot of modified sports but also to get a lot of children to try sport at all. I think many of them in our schools had got used to not participating actively in sport, and the Aussie Sports program has reversed that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I speak about women in sport I note also in the report a very detailed description of what the Commission is doing to address the problem of drugs in sport-another matter I have raised in this place in times past. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of women in sport the report contains a neat summary of the history of the Women's Sports Promotion Unit. Many people here would know that when I came into this Parliament in 1984 I was asked to convene an inquiry into women in sport. We made a number of recommendations and that report was tabled in both Houses of Parliament in early 1985. Subsequent to that a Task Force for Women's Sport was established, chaired by the Australian Sports Commissioner, Margaret Pewtress. That task force was established in November 1986 and was funded to run until 30 June 1987 but its time was extended so as to allow the task force to complete the national policy and plan for women in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1987 the Women's Sports Promotion Unit, the principal recommendation of our report and certainly something that the Task Force for Women's Sport continued to promote, was established by the then Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Mr John Brown. The Australian Sports Commission has allocated an initial $50,000 for that Women's Sport Promotion Unit. On pages 52 and 53 of the report is a detailed description of the aims and objectives of the Women's Sports Promotion Unit and a list of many of its achievements to this point. One that I draw to the attention of the Senate is:</PARA>
<PARA>A television community service advertisement has been made with Film Australia for the promotion of women in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>I had the pleasure of inviting Senator Richardson to launch that advertisement at a function I hosted in South Australia. I am advised that that community service advertisement was used quite often in the intervals in the coverage of the Olympic Games. I cannot say that that happened in all States; I have not had reports on it. But I know that in Canberra it was shown very often and received a good response. The advertisement actually features women of all ages, and I suppose all shapes and sizes, participating in a variety of sports. It is of considerable encouragement to women in the community to know that it is possible for them to take up all sorts of sporting activities, particularly at the recreational level but certainly to levels of elite excellence, as we saw with our women in sport at those very Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA> That community service advertisement is very much part of the Government's program-in fact the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has set this as a target-to increase by three times the number of women involved in sport and listed as participants in recreational and sporting activities around the country. At the back of the report is an extensive list of the numbers of registrants in a variety of sports, and alongside those names is an allocation of money for those sports. The list makes most interesting reading. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also points out that there is need for further data, that we cannot take these figures as the final ones, but they are certainly the beginning of a very comprehensive coverage not only of women in sport but of all participants in sport-men and women, girls and boys-around this country. I think the Australian Sports Commission report indicates that we are beginning to collect that data. It is a very useful document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in joining my colleague Senator Crowley in speaking to the annual report of the Australian Sports Commission. Many benefits are starting to flow from the positive achievements and initiatives outlined in the report. Firstly, I should pay tribute to the former Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Mr John Brown. I do so without in any way reflecting on the current Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) who is doing an excellent and enthusiastic job. Many of the initiatives in the Sports Commission report, and the Commission itself, were objectives set down by the Australian Labor Party for many years and implemented in government by John Brown. I think John Brown ought to be congratulated for that and the Australian community ought to be grateful to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like briefly to comment on the work of the first General Manager of the Sports Commission, Mr Greg Hartung, who stepped down at about the time the period of this report concluded-in June this year. I think he was known to many in the Parliament because of his activities in the Press Gallery. We were somewhat surprised when he became the General Manager of the Sports Commission, but he did an excellent job. My only regret is that he chose to leave but I understand that, as in other positions with which I am familiar, people cannot stay in one job forever. I wish Greg well in his new career and I thank him for the work that he did. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going into specific areas of the Sports Commission report I want to say generally that the Sport Commission and the Institute of Sport provide an integrated program of support for sporting activities in Australia. They mesh in well together. The Commission encourages community-wide activities as well as high performance participation, particularly by supporting national sporting organisations and through the Aussie Sports program. The Institute of Sport builds on that foundation and develops opportunities for individual athletes to excel. I think the balance is coming right. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Sports Commission report we see that assistance is being given to national sporting organisations in areas such as coaching and international sports research programs. Senator Crowley referred to many of these areas. There is special assistance also in areas of special need, such as women in sport, to which Senator Crowley referred; children in sport; sport for disabled persons; and veterans' sport. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, the report is important because it broadens the concept of the role of government in providing assistance, equality of opportunity and equal benefits. The report is taking sport away from the strictly economic area. It is saying, `Here are people whom the Government ought to assist by giving them equal opportunity and is giving them the pleasure of participating in healthy activities from which they get satisfaction. I think the distribution of pleasure as well as the distribution of income are very reasonable aspects but not the sole aspects of government participation and assistance in sport, recreation and the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minute or two available to me I want briefly to talk about one aspect of the Aussie Sports for Tonga program, with which I was involved. The extension of Western civilisation into countries in the Pacific has brought to them some of the health problems to do with our sedentary existence and our food and dietary habits. It was found that these problems had extended to Tonga. The people of Tonga requested the Sports Commission to assist them in the development of a program similar to the Aussie Sports program. It became clear, on examination, that the biggest impediment to such a scheme was Tonga's basic lack of general sporting equipment-bats, balls or whatever; the building blocks of the various sports. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority and the sporting organisations we conducted an appeal in Canberra as a trial run for what we hope will be a national scheme in the future to buy a large amount of sporting equipment from donations. Donations from parents, children, sportsmen and sportswomen were presented to the King of Tonga during his recent visit. I would like to congratulate all those people who contributed and all those people who organised the appeal. It is a positive contribution that Australia and Australian sport has made to our region. For that and other reasons I support and endorse the report from the Sports Commission and welcome its presentation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-89 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1988-89 symbolise the Government's success in running the economy of this country. That success depends greatly on the agreement which the Australian Labor Party reached with the unions in 1982-83 and which is known as the accord. The accord has undergone many an amendment and many a change, but the fundamental agreement that was reached has continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unions have played an essential part in restoring this country to the state it is now in. Much criticism is often made, particularly by the Opposition, about the irresponsibility of unions, about their exercise of power. Indeed, the claim is made that unions have too much power and that they exercise that power wrongly. That theme is based on the proposition that the days of Mr Bounderby, which Dickens described in Hard Times, have passed-that employers, to a man, a woman and a company, are enlightened persons dedicated not only to making industry flourish but also to making workers rich. The argument goes that unions are all right in their place, but are usually more of a hindrance than of a help to their members, and that good work relations, good economics and good times require an emasculation of unions and of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I want to talk about two industrial matters which are presently going on in Victoria. These two matters are illustrations of just how little things have changed since Dickens's time and how great a need there still is for organised labour. The two disputes are one dealing with the meat workers and one dealing with theatrical and amusement employees. The one concerning the meat workers is at Portland. For many years now Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd has run a meat works at Portland which has provided work for hundreds of people, has provided income for the town, and has provided much of the prosperity of that region. Recently, Borthwicks was taken over by Australian Meat Holdings, which in turn has been purchased by Elders-IXL Ltd. Although the physical works are there and are still known as Borthwicks, the meat works are in fact run by Australian Meat Holdings, which in effect is Elders. For some months now the meat workers of Portland have been out of work for a variety of factors and have been on unemployment benefits. Elders has now purported to open the works to employees, but on conditions which Elders have set and which are quite below the conditions that operate in the rest of the meat works in Victoria and, as I understand it, in most of the works in Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> At one stage there was some suggestion that the Commonwealth Employment Service in Portland would see that the workers were not paid unemployment benefits while the conditions offered by Elders were available. As I understand it, that suggestion has been put very much to rest. The position is that yesterday the works at Portland were opened but only 10 people turned up to work at the works. There was a picket line consisting of 200 people. The picket line was conducted peacefully, in good order, and with considerable politeness to all those who approached it. Of course, nothing was done to the 10 people who crossed the picket line. Today 12 people crossed the picket line but the hundreds of people who are needed at the works did not attend. </PARA>
<PARA> Elders is a member of the Export Council of Victoria, which is a division of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Victoria. The Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the Export Council of Victoria have agreed to pay and conditions for meat workers which are satisfactory for those who want to work at Portland. In other words, if Elders, Australian Meat Holdings, were to meet the wages and conditions which have been agreed to by the Export Council of Victoria, by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, Portland meatworks could be operating, the town would have much more money coming into it and matters could proceed with a useful return to the meatworks, the workers and the town of Portland. But Elders refuses to accept wages and conditions that the Export Council, of which it is a member, and the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, of which it is also a member, have agreed to and it has unfortunately brought hardship-tragedy is not too strong a word-disputes and disorder to the Portland region. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the help and guidance of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, the Portland workers would be put in a situation in which they were paid less than and work under lesser conditions than the current conditions of other meat workers in Victoria. A smallgoods works, Castle Bacon Pty Ltd at Castlemaine, has workers who have agreed to work at wages and conditions less than those prevailing elsewhere, but with the exception of that smallgoods works, which is not a meatworks, every other member of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation in Victoria and the Export Council of Victoria is willing to provide, and in fact does provide, the wages and conditions available to workers in the rest of Victoria, which return profit for the meatworks which are properly run in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very poor state of affairs. It is a matter of great regret which ought to visit censure upon Elders, upon Australian Meat Holdings, that it should so conduct its industrial relations as to bring about the present quite disastrous situation. It is often said here that if an agreement is reached which benefits a works and employees in a particular industry the union should not interfere with that process. In this case, workers want to work at levels of wages and conditions which are given to their fellows in the rest of Victoria but a particular company refuses even to enter into negotiations with the union about them. The workers in this case want the union to negotiate with the company, yet Australian Meat Holdings, Elders, refuses to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that people ought to be able to make agreements along the lines that they wish without interference from their union. The workers want the union to negotiate for them on wages and conditions with the employer, who is amongst those who trumpet and herald the need for new industry arrangements. The company should get down and negotiate with the union and, through the union, with the employees and return this works to operating on the profitable basis on which it has been operated in the past, which will enable the people of Portland, the meat workers of Portland and the region in general to profit and to flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> The second dispute relates to the cinema industry, which in Victoria is owned by three major chains-the Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd, Village Roadshow Corporation Ltd and Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd. Since 1981 they have operated under an agreement with the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association, which is the union which represents people working in the cinema industry in Australia. The union and the three chains have reached agreements over wages and conditions for some years. This year the agreement was up for renewal, which takes place every two years. Greater Union, Village and Hoyts came to an understanding which was then committed to writing and signed by Greater Union and Village, but Hoyts reneged on that agreement. Hoyts wanted lower staff ceilings and various conditions which the union and the people it represented would not agree to. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, to jump ahead a bit, Hoyts has proposed working conditions for its employees, some of which I will list to illustrate the approach that Hoyts has taken in this matter. First, it wants to reduce the adult wage rate by about 45 per cent. That is worth repeating: this company wants to reduce by 45 per cent the rates that have been paid to its employees in the past. It wants to reduce by 45 per cent the wages which are presently being paid by the Greater Union and Village chains. It wants to introduce junior rates which are as low as 40 per cent of the reduced adult rate. The company wants to remove all security of employment from current awards and agreements. It proposes that no full-time staff need be employed. It wants to remove all overtime and award conditions for projectionists. It wants to introduce a 12-hour day with no penalties for Sundays, public holidays or night work. It wants to pay overtime only after 12 hours of work and then at time and a half. These are some of the conditions that it wants. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute was taken to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission before a very experienced commissioner, Commissioner Mansini. On 9 September, Commissioner Mansini ordered that there be a return to the status quo. That meant that employees should return to employment and that Hoyts should provide to the workers who returned the pay and conditions which had operated prior to the dispute. The union agreed to that but Hoyts refused to obey the order of Commissioner Mansini, the order of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a second hearing, on 15 September. Again Commissioner Mansini ordered a return to the status quo, again the union agreed and again Hoyts refused. The next day there was an application to Commissioner Mansini to clarify his directions. He clarified his directions. The union again agreed to abide by those directions. Again Hoyts refused. Hoyts then took proceedings to have Commissioner Mansini stand down from the case. That application having been made, Commissioner Mansini, quite understandably, stood down. But his order that there should be a return to the status quo continued to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a further hearing in the Commission on 7 October before Mr Justice Williams who adjourned the matter to 10 October. On 10 October there was an application in the High Court by Hoyts by way of a prerogative writ of prohibition which sought to restrain Commissioner Mansini from further proceeding in the matter. Since then the matter has been in the hands of Mr Justice Williams. Hoyts refused to negotiate with the union. It refused to obey the order of Commissioner Mansini. It refused to pay the wages. It refused to provide the conditions that the other two chains have provided. In other words, it has introduced into the industry disorder, disputes and an attitude that did not formerly operate. It has disturbed a happy industrial climate. That, to say the least, is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two disputes that now exist in Victoria illustrate the difficulty that unions find with some employers in achieving a good industrial relationship, in establishing a proper industrial climate and in introducing the sort of culture that should be introduced into the workplace in Victoria and, indeed, in Australia. The situation has been caused by two employers who have failed to show a proper social responsibility, who have failed to recognise that workers are more than automatons, that they are not robots-that they are human beings, who are entitled to reasonable wages and conditions, who are entitled to be heard in negotiations about what their wages and conditions ought to be and who are entitled to negotiate their wages and conditions through their unions for whose officers they can vote. It is a disturbing trend that organisations such as Australian Meat Holdings, Elders and Hoyts have such a lack of social and industrial conscience that they have brought these matters to their present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to discuss one other matter that is unrelated to industrial relations. One of the provisions made in the Appropriation Bills is for an amount of about $623m this year for law, order and public safety. Law, order and public safety are a fundamental function of government. All three arms of government-legislative, executive and judiciary-are concerned with it. The legislature makes the laws, the executive carries them out and the judiciary declares what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Law, order and public safety cover a multitude of functions-courts, legal services, security and intelligence services, police, protective and custodial services. The rule of law is essential for the proper running of society. It can operate only if the community is dedicated to the great social values, including a hunger for justice, an appetite for compassion, and a dedication to altruism and integrity. Everybody is entitled to equality before the law, to due process in its application and to proper representation before its tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> Equality before the law can be obtained only if there is adequate representation before tribunals. Legal aid is crucial to achieving this. Madam Acting Deputy President, your State and mine, Victoria, has a proud record in the provision of legal aid. The Legal Aid Commission, under Mr Julian Gardner, is an example. The Fitzroy Legal Service stands as a mighty symbol of what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The public has an interest in seeing that crime is prevented; that, if it is committed, it is detected; and that, when it is detected, it is punished. But the public also has an interest in a free, tolerant and benign society. Crime can be detected and perhaps prevented by oppressive instruments. In recent years there has been a growth in instruments to detect crime which move away from the traditional methods by which crime was formerly detected. The National Crimes Commission Act of 1982 was followed by the National Crime Authority Act of 1984, both of which changed traditional policing methods. For example, the Acts gave power to authorities to compel production of documents. It gave them power to examine witnesses under oath. </PARA>
<PARA> Those precedents have been followed in New South Wales by the setting up of the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Act was passed this year and assented to on 6 July. In my view there is a danger that if commissions like this are set up and continue, in the end those sorts of methods of detecting or preventing crime become oppressive. Any democratic society, any free society, will have crime committed in it which, unfortunately, will go undetected and unpunished. The trouble is that if we try to ensure that every crime is detected, by no matter what method, we get close to having a police state. Under the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act, the Commissioner himself may issue a search warrant, if he thinks fit in the circumstances. He can compel the attendance of witnesses before him. He can examine them on oath and draw admissions from them. It is just a straw in the wind of what can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a constant demand in Australia for more police powers. I have in front of me a dodger put out during the last Victorian election by the Police Association which calls for major changes in the instruments available to police in that State. It talks about the increased role of lawyers and the government's approach to these matters. It measures one party's promises against another. Of course, the police should be allowed to express their opinion. But if a police force starts to become politicised, if it starts to pick up one party rather than the other, its traditional policing role is very much endangered. It would be a great shame if the police force of Victoria, or indeed of any State, started to become politicised. Sir John Fortescue, a chief justice in the fifteenth century, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I should, indeed, prefer twenty guilty men to escape death through mercy, than one innocent to be condemned unjustly. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the most outstanding judges in the Victorian Supreme Court, Mr Justice Crockett, said recently that it is better that 100 guilty people escape than one innocent suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fearful thing that innocent people should be punished. The most dramatic incident in Australia recently, of course, is the Chamberlain case, a most cruel and fearful occurrence which, let us hope, will not be repeated. But the attitude taken by some at the moment to the way the law ought to operate may well see such a case occur again. It is not only that people are punished but also that reputations can be ripped apart by innuendo. Indeed, in this chamber at times people's reputations are much damaged. If one looks at the way that reputations around Australia are pilloried at the moment, one observes that it is time we took stock of ourselves. I speak, for example, of the fearful tragedy in South Australia concerning Mr Sumner, the South Australian Attorney- General. I refer also to the way Mr Robin Gray in Tasmania has recently been attacked and, indeed, the way many members of the Cabinet in Queensland have had their reputations brought into public disrepute without having any real opportunity to defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Procedures such as those taken by royal commissions can be very helpful. On the other hand, they contain a dark side which is that people's reputations through the reporting of the proceedings and the proceedings themselves can be much tarnished without any real opportunity of having them restored. I raise the issue at a time when we are relying on more extraordinary means of policing, where we have calls for royal commissions and where we have calls for judicial inquiries. In deciding whether to proceed with those things, we think of the potential they have not only for rooting out crime that should be rooted out in this community but also for destroying people's reputations and lives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.15)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Chaney's proposed amendment in relation to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-89. The position of Australian families is a matter of real concern to me and other members of the Liberal and National parties. Certain sections of the media would have us believe that the major parties, namely, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party, have been using the family as a political football. Certainly this Government has kicked families as readily as any football player kicks a ball around the field. Previous speakers have given a clear indication of just how this Government's policies have hurt families. There is no point in going on this afternoon to reiterate those arguments. We are all very familiar with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those arguments, however, do not say that the family assistance scheme is of no assistance to families. That would be a ridiculous assertion to make. There is no attempt to ignore that initiative at all. But what we do say is this: firstly, that the need for the family assistance scheme, which is extra assistance for low income families, has been brought about by this insensitive Government's policies, and, secondly, that, irrespective of the family assistance scheme, middle income earners, those with too high an income to get that benefit, have been ignored by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Chaney accuses this insensitive Government of looking after only poor families he is quite right. Senator Crowley managed a contribution in this chamber a few days ago which I trust was not a little window into her intellectual ability. I am quite sure it was not. Senator Crowley took the complaint that the Government was only looking after poor families and the complaint that middle income families were being ignored and turned it, somehow, by some intellectual feat of gymnastics into a request to look after the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley knows that was not the point being made. One wonders who, in fact, she thought would believe her. Senator Crowley went on to make much of her Government's impact on women entering the work force. She referred to the participation of women finally tipping the 50 per cent mark now. That is true of all women. It is equally true of married women if one chooses to limit the aspect at which one looks. Senator Crowley made much of Labor's claim to have created one million jobs since coming to office. She perhaps undersold Labor's achievement in that respect because I notice that the figures are something over one million. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to spend a minute or two casting some light on what that bald figure alone does not tell the Senate. We may have been interested in the increase in the categories of jobs-that is, in terms of full time or part time jobs-broken down by sex. As it turns out, it will come as no surprise to honourable senators to hear that the biggest percentage increase in the categories of jobs by sex is that of married women taking part time jobs. It is true that, when one looks at the full picture in absolute terms, most of the jobs that have been created are full time jobs. I make no suggestion that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the biggest percentage increase is in women taking part time jobs. The increase is something like 36 per cent. Senator Crowley may well claim credit on behalf of the Government for this increase and extol the virtues of her Government's policies as they relate to women. To the extent that any policies of this Government improve the access of women to the work force, I am pleased. I am happy for barriers blocking women's entry to the work force to be broken down. But is that what this Government has done?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it not a more realistic perspective to look at this recent increase in women's part time work as being due to a variety of reasons? Perhaps the answer is yes. Some of the increase is perhaps a consequence of improvement of access. I refer in other words to a reduction in the barriers that currently limit women's access to the work force. It is also fair to accept an additional reason for the increase in women taking on part time work, namely, a rush of women into part time work because the standard of living of families has so fallen that with only one income earner those families who would otherwise choose to be single income families cannot afford to continue to make that choice. So economic reality takes the choice away from them and they are forced into the work force to do part time work. To the extent that this Government's policies have increased the number of women in the work force for that reason, it is to be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing Senator Crowley did not mention in respect of the employment or unemployment market is the very large increase in duration of unemployment. Obviously all honourable senators would be pleased to see those who want jobs getting them; that is, to see a fall in the number of unemployed and, conversely, a rise in the number employed. But what about those people-albeit a smaller number-who are unemployed? The fact is that under this Government the duration of unemployment has extended quite dramatically. The younger people in this respect are not so badly off. When Labor came to office women under 18 had an average duration of unemployment of 22.7 weeks. Fortunately, by 1986 that period had gone up to only 23.3 weeks. But we find that for women from 45 to 54, at the older end of the labour force-women who obviously would have a greater difficulty in finding work-the figure has shifted from 63.7 weeks to 82.8 weeks. Taking an average of all age groups, the average duration of unemployment when this Government came to office was 42.7 weeks-no short period of time. In 1986 it had shifted up to 49.8 weeks. So in the labour force area there is some good news for women, married women in particular. But for those not lucky enough to have jobs the news is not good. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crowley's contribution also, in my view, purported to create the impression that this Government was responsible for the dramatic changes; that in fact something it had done had enabled more women to enter the work force than before. Senator Crowley sought to take some credit in that respect. As I have already said, some credit in that area may be due. But, of course, changes as dramatic as those that have occurred in status of women matters, particularly in respect of labour force participation, are not explained by a single stroke of the pen or a few words in anybody's speech. I would like to spend a few minutes briefly outlining some of those changes. Sometimes we get so used to change that we become accustomed to it and almost ignore it. It is useful to look back and take stock of what has happened. The number of females undertaking year 12 at school has increased by almost 66 per cent over the last 10 years. That is a phenomenal increase. The number of females undertaking university studies has increased by almost 40 per cent over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Families are having fewer children. In 1972 the crude birth rate was 20 per 1,000. In 1987 it had fallen to 15. Families now tend to be smaller in terms of the number of dependent children. In 1969, 35 per cent of married couple families had three or more children. In 1985 only 27 per cent had three or more children. The average number of children per family has decreased from 2.09 in 1977 to 1.97 in 1985. The number of families with five or more children has decreased by 45 per cent between the years 1977 and 1985. Those few figures make quite clear the sort of changes families are undergoing in terms of the number of dependants that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Dollar for dollar, family disposable income, which incidentally has fallen since 1984-85 under this Labor Government, has become, over a greater time span, greater than it has ever been. For example, in real terms it is now $385 a week. In 1966-1967 in real terms it was $298 a week. In terms of our disposable incomes we are wealthier; nonetheless we are having fewer children. Although the latest figures show the marriage rate today to be virtually the same as it was 25 years ago, the divorce rate is up. There has been an increase of 243 per cent from 1960 to 1987. We all know, of course, that there are now significantly more sole parents. In percentage terms the number of sole parent families has increased from 3.9 per cent of all families and non-family individuals in 1969 to 7.8 per cent in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> These are quite startling changes. But to get back to the details with respect to the labour force to which Senator Crowley referred-namely, labour force participation of women and, in particular, married women-anybody who thinks that the streaming of women into the work force is a function of some gratuitous effort on the part of the Australian Labor Party should think again. I can provide some figures to indicate why I think my remark is justified. Married women have streamed into the work force. Let us, if we can, turn back to 1933. Those of us who cannot will have to rely on the records. In June 1933, when my mother was about 11, the labour force participation rate for married women was only 5 per cent. In 1954, two years after my mother had her fourth and last child-namely me-it was 12.6 per cent. A decade or more on, in 1968, when I was in year 11 at secondary school, the labour force participation rate of married women was 31.8 per cent. In 1978, when I got married, it was 41.9 per cent. This year it has reached 50.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures indicate that from 1933 to now there has been a very steady progression of women into the work force, perhaps enhanced in some way by some policies that Labor has introduced and no doubt enhanced in some way by policies the Liberal Party of Australia has pursued. Of course it is a folly of parliamentarians to believe that it is what they do that has a significant impact on social attitudes. One might like to consider that in 1952, when I was born, the pill was not available. Some honourable senators may regret that having been the case. Nonetheless, at that time very few women went to university and the age of materialism was really just beginning to dawn. I can put that in some perspective by putting it this way: when I was at school the sign of mega-status was a set of Lakeland Derwent coloured pencils. </PARA>

Technology has produced more goods and a more effective way of saturating our brains with their availability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The picture I have tried briefly to paint is one of enormous social change involving women, especially with respect to labour force participation-enormous social change that we now have to respond to. One of the responses we hear is, `Well, families must have more children'. We ask ourselves, `Why are families having fewer children?'. I suggest that the reason families are having fewer children is not simply a function of money. Anyone who is under the impression that by hurling money at families all of a sudden families will start to have more children should think again. I think the record shows that that is the case. Therefore, our fertility rate will not be altered simply by money. It is a question of changing social attitudes and values. Two-income couples with children do not love their children any less because both parents work. It is not my assessment that they have inferior values because they both work. They have simply made different choices from those which others have made. They may have made different choices for selfish reasons; at the same time, they may have made those choices because of what they want to give their children. They may have made the choice that they would rather have fewer children and give them a private education or overseas holidays. I would have thought that the classic Liberal philosophy is that families should make the choices that suit them. That is certainly my view. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel more sorry for two-income couples with children than I do for the `double income no kids' couples-the DINKS. They bear the acrimony of some single income families as a consequence of their having two incomes. What is forgotten is that both parents go to work; they both get on the bus every morning, go to work, and return home on the bus at night. In their spare time, in the evening hours or at the weekend, two-income families do their housework and help the kids with their homework. All of the housework is still done. Two-income families do not live in dirty hovels. They manage somehow, very largely by making a simple choice about how they want to live-whether they want to work to earn more, in order to give their children more, and whether, in order to do that, they are prepared to give up what would otherwise be leisure time and devote that time to housework. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I admit that economic factors impact on choices. One would be silly to say that economic factors play no part in family choices; of course, they do. That is why I was careful to say that choices with respect to the number of children one has are not just a function of money, although money is certainly a part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, due to what some would describe as the dramatic fall in our fertility rate, a useful task for this Parliament would be to look at what we can do to assist families economically. We should look at whether the assistance we are providing at the moment is appropriate. If it is not, we should look at what we can do about it-whether we can redirect assistance or review assistance to help families at the time they need it most, which is when one parent in a two-income family leaves the work force to start a family. That is when they suffer a huge fall in family income, and that is when they certainly need the most help. </PARA>
<PARA> If one asks people aged about 40, 50 or 60 when they most needed assistance, inevitably they will say that it was when they started to have children. Perhaps the Government could look at allowing women, for example, to average their incomes. When a woman leaves the work force to start a family she should be able to accumulate income for, say, two or three years prior to leaving the work force. That income could be averaged over two or three years while she started a family. The income tax credits could either be simply paid back in cash or used as an income tax credit, should she choose to do part time work. As you and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, many women who leave the full time work force to have children want to do some part time work. This does not mean that they do not like their children; they simply want to do some work as well as look after their children. The figure of 50.2 per cent of married women in the work force indicates that women are determined to do both. It is folly for anybody to think that he or she can turn back that tide. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be looking at ways in which we can assist people to make real choices about what they want to do. Under the scheme that I have proposed, if tax credits were stored for about three years after the woman had left the work force to have a child, she would be able to take some part time work without finding the child-care cost quite as prohibitive as many women now do.</PARA>
<PARA> We must develop policies, as I say, which allow families to make real choices. In that regard I believe the Liberal and National parties' industrial relations policy will make a real contribution to improving the choices that women have. It is my view that increased flexibility in the labour market will enable women to have greater access to that market. I believe they have been locked out of it. Unions and those who have jobs have kept the women out. I certainly recommend to Government members a quick, or perhaps not so quick, perusal of our industrial relations policy. Any elements of that policy that they can bring themselves to introduce prior to our taking government at the next election will be more than appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave the comments that I chose to make with respect to family formation and what we can do about it and make a few brief comments on some remarks that have been made by certain Government senators with regard to my occasional refusal of leave to incorporate second reading speeches in Hansard over the last week or so. It is a normal courtesy which the Senate extends to a Minister, when introducing a Bill from the other place, to allow the second reading speech to be incorporated in Hansard. It is a sensible courtesy and it saves time. Generally speaking, there is no need to read the speeches in this place because they have already been read in the other place. Courtesies of the Parliament, however, have an element of mutuality about them. One extends them, and they are extended back. One withdraws them, and they are withdrawn from oneself. It is a fairly simple equation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last sitting fortnight Senator Collins chose-incidentally, without letting me know-in a speech in the adjournment debate to make what some would describe as an attack on me. As Senator Collins obviously does not think it important to let people know when he is going to speak about them, I have not bothered to let him know that I am about to say something about him. The matter related to a press release of mine or, rather, some material attached to it. Senator Collins was of the view that I had broken the law. He came into the chamber full of moral outrage. As I suspect that most of us have broken the speed limit or something at some stage, I point out that his outrage was not at the law being broken but at the nature of the alleged breach as he saw it. The last words are reasonably important, because in giving legal opinions one thing is of paramount importance-that is, getting the facts right. If the facts are materially wrong, one's legal opinion is sure to be wrong. The next skill required is to understand the law as it stands. It is a skill that one expects of lawyers. One should be apprehensive about laymen taking this upon themselves. Senator Collins, if he is a layman, seems to have no such apprehension. He is quite confident of his ability-not a confidence shared by me or by any other person whose opinion I have sought on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not worried about what I see as ignorance or overconfidence on his behalf with respect to his legal ability. I am surprised that someone who served on the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, as Senator Collins did, would not take the opportunity that this presented to learn something of the law in this area. In Senator Collins's case this opportunity apparently was not taken up. I accept that my assessment is subjective; I may be wrong. The Government may care to prosecute me and test this matter. I think it unlikely that it will do that, so we will never really know. I remain confident that my assessment of the law is correct and that I have not broken the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the facts, with respect to Senator Collins's allegation, being wrong. With regard to incorrect information, we understand that there is often a measure of ignorance, stupidity, incompetence or, sadly, on some occasions, bad faith. If one is ignorant of the facts of a matter and does nothing, it matters little, because one can wallow in one's ignorance. But if one wants to pick up that ignorance and attack someone with the consequences of it-namely, incorrect statements-in my view, one is stupid, incompetent or acting in bad faith. I had not previously thought of Senator Collins as stupid, although I am not sure whether I think of him in that way now. I had not thought of him as being the essence of incompetence. I do not think of him in that way now, either. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins, on the occasion to which I referred, treated the Senate to a long commentary on his Sunday mornings in the Northern Territory spent watching, for example, the Reverend Jimmy Swaggart on television. He suggested that that gentleman, while posing as an upholder of moral values, was in fact a fraud, a degenerate and a crook. The object of this exercise was not clear to me. Its relevance seemed doubtful. I can only assume that Senator Collins was implying that people who vocally uphold moral values, or what they see as being of moral value, are deep down prone to be crooks and frauds. I had not thought of Senator Collins as being weak, but I wonder why we were treated to his view if it was not to make such an imputation, namely, that those who do that are in some way crooks and frauds. One wonders why, if that is what he thought, he did not come straight out and say it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that an honourable senator would come into this place and verbally paint an incorrect picture without checking the facts. As my alleged actions formed the subject of his allegations, one might have thought he would bother to check them with me. Some honourable senators may think his not having done so says quite a lot about his competence as a senator. That he neither made such inquiries nor let me know of this proposed attack certainly says something about the courtesies that he is prepared to extend. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of competence, I wish to add one further remark. One of the first things one is taught in legal practice or articles as they relate to court work or advocacy is: if one does not think one is going to like the answer to a question, one should not ask it. Perhaps Senator Collins, being an advocate for himself in this matter-being an advocate, as I understand it, of this sort of offensive trash and rubbish being available all over Australia through the Australian Capital Territory-decided just that: not to ask me a question that he may not like the answer to. In a sense, he may have deliberately decided to remain in ignorance, to avoid a question he did not think he would like the answer to. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing one is taught is that if one is unsure of what the answer might be, and especially if one suspects one might not like the answer, one should not, for heaven's sake, base anything on the answer, because that is an incompetent risk. Senator Collins took that risk and made allegations on the basis of the facts as he would like them to be. He had an opportunity to check them out and he failed to take the opportunity. He took a chance that they would be right. He came into this chamber and attacked another senator on that basis. It was bad odds. The matters as he presented them are incorrect. Senator Collins has been misled, or has misled himself, and consequently has misled a lot of others, including colleagues and the media. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain sections of the media were misled by what was said in here, and perhaps Senator Collins spoke to some of them directly, outside this chamber. I wonder whether Senator Collins would feel any responsibility if, as a consequence of his remarks, I had chosen to sue, and had successfully sued, certain sections of the media. I take deep offence at the suggestion that I am the sort of person who distributes pornography willy-nilly around Parliament House, especially in a manner that enhances its availability to small children. </PARA>
<PARA> Would Senator Collins say that he was not responsible, or would he say that the media should have checked with him or that they misunderstood him? Why is there a tighter standard for them than for him? He did not check his facts with me, so why should they check theirs with him? Is it because they risk libel and slander? Surely their duty in this regard is matched by his: to get the facts right before setting himself up as judge and jury. Does he not think they ought to be able to rely on what he says? If not, is he not thereby admitting his own unreliability?</PARA>
<PARA> I have made some inquiries following Senator Collins's remarks as to the availability of this material. It was widely distributed around Parliament House but, as my interjection recorded in Hansard indicated, not by me. Certain sections of the media have their views as to who is responsible. Senator Collins seems to have held himself out as an expert as to its availability. I wonder how he knew the extent of its distribution. He knew more than I did. Perhaps he could cast light on who really was responsible for its willy-nilly distribution around Parliament House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this Labor Government came to power it claimed that the economy was in tatters. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), supposedly claimed to be the world's best, has boasted that he has restored Australia's economic sovereignty. Indeed, his opening words in this year's Budget Speech are very well worth noting. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . tonight I can report to the people of Australia that the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget that will do much to secure our future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget which consolidates the progress since 1983, and locks onto our targets, the balance of payments deficit and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . this Budget is the right Budget at this time, and provides Australia with a unique set of outcomes and priorities which could only be delivered by the heart, creativity and intellectual strength of the Australian Labor movement. </PARA>
<PARA>The rhetoric is there but it is very sadly lacking in reality. The reality is that since that speech in August the key economic factors, which the Treasurer himself classed as significant, are way off the Government's estimates. For the past five years the Treasurer's predictions and promises on inflation have not once been met. Each year, with the exception of his first Budget, inflation has been higher than predicted. There is no doubt that he will once again be wrong this year because the predicted 4.5 per cent inflation rate seems almost impossible, even after only four months of the new financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget depends on two significant factors: the balance of payments and inflation. Mr Keating was confident in August that he could keep Bill Kelty and the unions off the boil to hold down inflation and that he had divine intuition that commodity prices would increase export earnings and therefore improve the balance of payments position. The reality now is that Australia's trade deficit has been blown right off course, and with it has gone the linchpin of the whole of the Budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the Treasurer's claims, Australia's economy is deteriorating, not improving. Our current account deficit is already $685m worse than for the same period last year. The balance of payments deficit figure for October was $1.685 billion, with imports up by 18 per cent, and the balance on merchandise trade at a record deficit figure of $681m. We have no hope of coming in under the projected $9.5 billion, and there is a real risk that our current account deficit will increase by $2 billion to $3 billion. In recent days interest rates have risen. I know that well, being in the farming community, because we have to have overdrafts and the interest rate on overdrafts has gone up quite substantially. In fact, it is now about 18 per cent. The value of the Australian dollar has also risen, so that is also affecting our commodity prices on such items as wool and wheat, which have fallen quite dramatically in a short period. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions are restless and the Treasurer cannot be as certain as he was a few months ago that he has the Australian Council of Trade Unions under control. He has only another few months to go before he will have quite heavy pressures put on him. The losers as a result of his failure to read the economy correctly will not only be the Government but also the home buyers, who will be unable to pay the 15 per cent-plus interest rate which is now the going rate for home loans. Small business will also be the loser, as it depends on loan finance. The losers will also be the farmers, who depend on strong export commodity prices, which I have already mentioned. The losers will also be, and already are, the State governments, which are faced with increasing costs for roads, education and health. Even today the national account figures have analysed gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the last three months at 0.3 per cent. Senator Stone asked a very good question on this matter in the Senate this afternoon. I can-not say that the answer was as good as the question. I think Senator Walsh had quite a deal of trouble in answering the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question was not too long. It was a very good and detailed question, a question which was put with a lot of thought and application. I am afraid the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) was found well and truly wanting in his answer to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Economists are already expressing concern at this figure and at where the economy is going. Again, the Treasurer's prediction of an annual growth figure of 12 per cent appears unable to be met. We have heard the same rhetoric from this Treasurer for two years about where the current account is heading. In March 1986 he said that he remained confident that:</PARA>
<PARA>a downward trend in the current account deficit would emerge during that year.</PARA>
<PARA>We are still to witness this downward trend some 31 months later. Obviously, the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), who is in the chamber, would be very concerned about this because every Australian is worried about the fact that we are living beyond our means. There is a concern not only to the Minister on her salary but also to all people in the community. It means that the standard of living for the ordinary, average Australian is continuing to decline. Australians know that it does not matter how hard they work-they can work as hard as they like-they will really not get any further ahead. Taxes and inflation are continuing to eat away at the very heart of the good Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't they do something?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good question. Why does the Government not do something about it? It is high time it did. Every time young people get close to a deposit for a house or land the price soars. Every time they work out their household budget to see whether they can afford the repayments, the interest rate goes up. This is reflected in the number of homeless people and families living below the poverty line. While we have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) making pledges about children not living in poverty, another family gets taken into care or evicted from a house it can no longer afford to rent. More than 700,000 Australians have now fallen below the poverty line since this Government came to power. More than 60,000 people live on the verge of homelessness; 40,000 people sleep in refuges by night and are forced to roam the streets by day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is from a government that claims it is compassionate to the poor and needy in our society. This is the same Government that, in the Budget, took the blowtorch to the retired in the community, accusing them of being fat cats with holiday houses and boats stashed around the country. This is the same Treasurer who was forced a few weeks later to announce modifications to the income test because of `unintended consequences'. Thank goodness that grey power brought that to his attention. I was probably one of the few senators who put out a press release about this matter on Budget night and there was a little item in the paper the next day. I went to some members of the press gallery and said, `I think this will be one of those cases where the Treasurer will have to back down from the position he has taken in the Budget'. I also said, `I think it would be a good idea if you had a good look at it because grey power will win the day'. I am glad that was the case because that measure hit at the people who had saved and who had looked after their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's Budget strategy is all wrong and sadly we are seeing one indicator after another falling away. First it was the current account, then inflation, now it is the national growth. The Government's predictions are dependent on strong world growth and continuation of strong commodity prices for Australian exports. As I have said, the wool market has all but collapsed due to a number of factors, not the least of which is the strengthening of our dollar and that is caused by the rise in the interest rates and the money coming in. As I have also already said, the wheat market has fallen back and honourable senators will find-and I will make a prediction about this-that rural exports will slow and yet another part of the economic strategy package will go wrong. The beef market, especially, has fallen back quite dramatically because of the value of the yen compared with that of the Australian dollar. The United States economy is looking shaky and there is strong talk of a recession there in the next 12 months. Quite often if America catches a cold, Australia catches pneumonia. I do not think we are in any shape to gear up to take up the manufacturing slack if Australia's rural exports weaken. Because of the economic policies of this Government, I do not think that as a country we are fit enough at the moment to handle the pneumonia when it comes-when the new United States President takes a stand on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>the manufacturing sector was in dire straits 10 years ago, and today the situation has only worsened. </PARA>
<PARA>You, Mr Acting Deputy President, sat on that inquiry with me and we were both concerned about that. That will not be fixed by this Government's policies. Those policies will not give the incentive for manufacturing industries to gear up. They need incentives and they need assistance. Disincentives are now imposed on them by militant trade union demands and also by the value of the dollar. Machinery costs so much now and they will need assistance and help to gear up and they are not getting it in any way whatsoever. The Government says that this is the responsibility of the industry and that it should contribute more to research, development and investment in the plant. That is just not possible. In Australia's economic climate, with inflation, the cost of money and the rates of taxation, what incentives has this Government given to those industries at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> Even at the public level, the Government refuses to set any lead, with major institutions such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) being absolutely gutted this year. The professors, scientists and everyone who works at the CSIRO are worried about what is happening. Staff are expected to work with obsolete equipment, contribute free labour and provide their own materials. They are also forced to take unpaid leave which is considered the norm rather than the unusual. I take my hat off to the people of the CSIRO for the job they do under very trying and difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick for his `hear, hear!' because I know of his concern for the CSIRO. I also thank Senator MacGibbon, Senator Reid and Senator McGauran for their support. We have all been on the same tram in making representations and asking the Government to take heed of what is happening to the CSIRO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government claims that the answer is not in spending cuts. Yet it cuts funding to essential areas such as research and support for institutions such as CSIRO while it gives tax relief to beer drinkers and perfume buyers. I cannot see the logic of that and I think the Government obviously has the wrong drift of things and also the wrong smell of things. Clearly, this Government has no idea of where it is heading. It continues to preach one thing while enacting another and the reality continues to fail the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should look at the rhetoric that has been going on about Kingsford-Smith Airport in Sydney. If $280m were spent on that airport, its capacity would probably be increased by some 40-odd per cent. This Government is sitting on its hands and not doing anything about that. What about the fact that it has cut 25 per cent off the budget that was applicable to our export industries? Those are the sorts of things that the Government should be doing something about. Tourists come into Kingsford-Smith Airport at Mascot. That airport needs revamping and gearing up so it can handle that incoming tourist trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I finish I would like to read a couple of points from the amendment that is proposed by the Opposition. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate condemns the Government for: (a) producing stagnant productivity, high inflation, a continuing balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates which are hurting business and home buyers alike. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I have already made that point. We call on the Australian people to do something about it. They have done something about it in recent by-elections and I am quite sure that any time this Government goes to the people it will find that the people will make the decision that this Government has not cared about the ordinary people; it has only cared about its big mates who it has looked after in a fashion to the detriment of the ordinary people of Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; they would not go to church. They would never take an oath of allegiance. I seem to remember one incident in 1975 when a government was thrown out because it could not get its money by 11 November, as a very good question in this chamber some days ago pointed out. My colleagues on this side of the chamber have done a very good job in exposing the shortcomings of the Government with respect to its proposed expenditure in the year ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to use the short time available to me to canvass the expenditure of the Government; rather I want to look at something that is relatively rarely dealt with in this chamber-that is, how information relating to the expenditure of money is given to the Parliament. It is very important, in fact it is crucial, that the Parliament be fully informed. The Government is responsible and accountable for all the expenditures that are made, for it is money that is taken from the community, not government money, that is spent annually. The senators in this chamber have a special right to know how that money is being spent because they are the elected representatives of the community, and to some degree we all bear a responsibility for the accountability of the expenditure. One of the great prerogatives of government is that it can raise whatever money it wants in the form of taxes and other charges. It is government's equal prerogative to spend that money in any way it sees fit. If the community does not like what the Government is doing with respect to raising and spending money the recourse is through the ballot box at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> But the other side of the coin, balancing the privilege of raising money and spending it, is accountability. There is an absolutely inescapable obligation on the Government to account for every penny it spends. The Federal Government, whatever its political orientation, does that. An elaborate system of checks and balances is built into the federal system to make it so. We, as individual senators, have a part in it whether we are in government or in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast this with the actions of the Government in my State of Queensland, where the community has no assurance of accountability of the expenditure of funds other than the word of the Premier of the day. The Queensland State Parliament has no way of exploring the expenditure made by executive government, the Ministry or the departments of state beyond the limits which are permitted by the executive government of the day. That does not apply in this chamber and in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I re-emphasise the central point that, in return for the right to impose and collect taxes for the betterment of society as a whole, a government has an inalienable obligation to account for the expenditure of those taxes. In the Federal Parliament there are a number of ways in which this comes about. There are extensive Budget papers; there are the Appropriation Bills; there is the Joint Committee of Public Accounts; and there are Senate Estimates committees. The Senate Estimates committees cover every department of the Federal Government and examine the proposed expenditure for the year. Representatives of each department are required to appear before the relevant committees to answer questions put by senators about expenditure. Departmental officers are obliged to answer fully and accurately any questions relating to proposed or past expenditure, but they are not required to explain the reasons for that expenditure. That is the responsibility of the government of the day. The government of the day decides where the money is spent and it is for that government to justify that spending to the electorate. But it is for the public servants to account for the amounts that are spent and accurately reveal them to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to have Estimates committees because it is simply impossible in one single document to cover the expenditure of the annual Budget of the Federal Parliament, which is now in excess of $70 billion a year. The limitations on Senate Estimates committees are the knowledge of the individual senators about the particular departments and their competence at questioning the public servants. Another limitation can be the degree of cooperation of the public servants with the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Having now completed my eleventh year as a member of an Estimates committee for the main annual Estimates, I have no hesitation in saying that the quality of evidence given to committees varies considerably from department to department. Some departments are open and friendly; many others require some degree of persistence and determination, to put it euphemistically, to elicit the desired information. While it is desirable, of course, that information be freely given, it is an absolute requirement that information be accurate and not misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had occasion in the past four or five years to comment on the conduct of witnesses with respect to the nature of their evidence. One of the matters that I have commented on is the increasing politicisation of witnesses over the past 10 years. Going back in my files I found that in one of my speeches I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without going deeply into the matter, I want to talk about the politicisation of the senior levels of the Australian Defence Force. I have referred to this matter in the past in this chamber. The only point I want to add is that I emphasise that I am not talking about the politicisation in party political terms. That is not part of my argument at all. What I am saying is that there is a very great danger that the advice that the Parliament and the executive Government get from the professionals in the service is increasingly tailored to what they perceive to be the view of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>On another occasion some three or four years ago, on the same topic, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect has been that far too many witnesses who have appeared before us have given us answers that are obstructive, evasive and at times misleading-in an intentional way-and some of the witnesses have been inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA>So my concern about the quality of evidence given to the Parliament goes back quite a few years. </PARA>
<PARA> When witnesses appear before Senate Estimates committees they are appearing before the Parliament and the people of Australia because they, as public servants, are accounting to the people of Australia for the expenditure of public moneys. It is not for them to be obstructive and evasive, and least of all misleading or dishonest. The Parliament, irrespective of parties, will impose the requisite censure and discipline on those who transgress these latter requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The central point of my speech this afternoon concerns the evidence of one witness during the estimates for the Department of Defence this year which, in the most favourable light, is grossly and wilfully misleading and, at worst, is dishonest. Some brief background material is required before going into details. The Australian Department of Defence has been engaged for at least a decade in developing a new secure communications network. The system consists of three blocks. The first block is called Project Raven, which deals with the design and production of a whole family of mobile radio sets and message gear for use in the field. The second block is Project Parakeet, which is the next step in the communications equipment chain, again for use in the field. Finally there is Project Discon, which is a fixed secure communications system around the country between defence headquarters and establishments-almost like a private Telecom network for the Services, with the exception that it is secure against eavesdropping and interdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The first project, Project Raven, is proceeding reasonably satisfactorily. Apart from the fact that Project Discon seems to be moving at a very slow pace, almost at glacial pace, it seems to be coming along satisfactorily, but Project Parakeet is not going well. It is common knowledge to anyone who takes an interest in these matters that for over a year Project Parakeet was in big trouble, so much so that in the early part of this year a number of accounts in the press listed some of the difficulties of the projects. Some of those articles said that the next stages of the contract would not be automatically awarded to the prime contractor, as is the usual practice, but would be open for public tender. It is against this background of considerable information on the public record-information, I might add, that has subsequently been proved to be correct-and of considerably more detailed information which was available to a number of us privately, not from Government sources, I might add, that questions were asked of the Department of Defence at the Estimates Committee hearing on 21 April 1988. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the relevant passages from the Hansard of 21 April 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the Press report which talks about a phase being likely to be reopened for tender suggests that tenders had been sought and perhaps awarded. Was that for a particular phase?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-We have completed phases 1, 2 and 3. At the end of phase 3 the contractor is obliged to put forward proposals for phases 4 and 5 and those proposals are now being considered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have tenders been sought for phases 4 or 5?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-`Tenders' implies that we sought open tenders. What we sought were contractual commitments from the contractor as to how he would see continuing phases 4 and 5. There was a contractor who completed phase 3 and he has been asked to give us prices for phases 4 and 5. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what I asked. Does the major equipment project items of a saving of $157.5m, affect Project Parakeet? Do you mean that it is not included in there? There is no reduction, slippage, rescheduling or whatever we might like to call it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-No, Senator, not in these additional estimates. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the news report in the Sunday Telegraph of 27 March that Parakeet was in doubt was not accurate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I think that speculation of that kind is premature. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You make me more suspicious than ever by your answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Those answers were quite evasive. I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it not true that there are considerable technical problems with Parakeet?</PARA>
<PARA>And that was a leading question. Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an overstatement. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not true that one of the major subcontractors is in difficulty?</PARA>
<PARA>One of the major subcontractors was in difficulty, and that was common knowledge. Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that that, too, is an overstatement. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on-evasion and misleading answer after misleading answer. A little later Senator Newman asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it behind schedule?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Not significantly, no. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to mark those words. Remember that this is not more then seven months ago, on 21 April 1988. The impression was clearly conveyed to the Senate Estimates Committee that the program was going normally, with only the usual sorts of hitches and glitches that are inseparable from a new technology. It is clearly established by Dr McIntosh's answers that the program was not late, because in direct answer to the question from Senator Newman, `Is it behind schedule?', he said, `Not significantly, no'. Clearly we were given no indication that the project was over budget. We were given no indication that there were management problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the main Estimates of 10 October 1988, only six months later. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the relevant passages from the Estimates Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Newman asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What were the other reasons? You said it was the principal reason. </PARA>
<PARA>Major-General Francis answered:</PARA>
<PARA> We had some management problems with the company. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to take the time of the Senate going through those points, although I will refer back to them in a few minutes. Six months after we had an assurance that there was no delay on the program contemplated we are told categorically that there is at least a 12-month delay coming. We were given no indication in April that the management and technical side of the program was not proceeding satisfactorily, yet Major-General Francis in evidence affirmed that there were major management and technical problems with the company as well as financial ones in so far as it was not meeting the contract. In other words, all the reports that were in the press in the early part of this year have been confirmed in the latter part of the year, in the face of contradictions from a witness from the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone who had an interest in this field knew that the prime contractor, Racal, was experiencing significant managerial problems within its own company and that those problems were flowing on to the way it was managing this very large program. Everyone knew that there were very considerable technical problems in the development of the equipment, not the least with the Scandinavian subcontractor who was developing the switchgear and simply could not deliver. In Department of Defence contracts of this nature, once a prime contractor has been selected and his performance is satisfactory, although the stages are let sequentially, the prime contractor will almost always be granted the successive phase because his performance has been acceptable to the Department in the early ones. Everyone knew that, although it was a five-phase contract, at the end of phase 3 it would go to open tender because the Department was not satisfied. That information was withheld from the Committee by the witness. The Senate has certain rules as to the conduct of witnesses. Only this year, on Wednesday, 24 February 1988, on the matter of parliamentary privilege, resolutions covering the appearance of witnesses were passed by this chamber. Resolution (12) deals with offences by witnesses, et cetera. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (12) A witness before the Senate or a committee shall not:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) without reasonable excuse, refuse to make an oath or affirmation or give some similar undertaking to tell the truth when required to do so;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) without reasonable excuse, refuse to answer any relevant question put to the witness when required to do so; or-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the relevant one in the case of Dr McIntosh-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) give any evidence which the witness knows to be false or misleading in a material particular,</PARA>
<PARA>or which the witness does not believe on reasonable grounds to be true or substantially true in every material particular. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a charge to be laid against the good doctor that he has misled the Senate on a very important point. In April, when asked whether Project Parakeet was behind schedule, Dr McIntosh responded `Not significantly, no'. When it was put that there were serious technical problems with the project the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who was at the table, stated that Dr McIntosh had already said that there were no significant problems. This characterisation of Dr McIntosh's answers was accepted by the Committee. As the transcript shows, I gave Dr McIntosh the opportunity to resile from his previous assurances that there were no problems with this program because I knew very well there were highly significant problems. I gave him that chance, as the Hansard shows. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I put it to you there are serious technical problems with Parakeet. Is that true or false?</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot put it more clearly than that: `Is is true or false?' Senator Richardson responded:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh has now answered the question three times. I wonder how many times he is expected to answer it. He has said that there are no significant problems. He has said it a couple of times now. I think that is probably enough. </PARA>
<PARA>I gave Dr McIntosh his chance. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> So long as Dr McIntosh realises that that is the position on the record. </PARA>
<PARA>There was not a word from Dr McIntosh. Senator Richardson intervened:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that he recognises that it is on the record. He has had to repeat it several times. He seems happy to live with it. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the position. Dr McIntosh did not resile from the answers he gave to the Senate. When I asked whether the date for the equipment being in operation had been set back as a result of technical difficulties, Dr McIntosh replied, `At this time, no'. Yet in the Estimates Committee six months later Major-General Francis stated that it was expected there would be overall about a year's delay on Parakeet. It is not only the delay that is the critical point here; there is the matter of the technical performance of the company, the management and the cost. All of those things were withheld from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh is a very senior officer. He above anyone else in this country was in a position, and is in a position, to know the status of Project Parakeet not only now but at the start of the year and certainly at April. He knew what the true story was. He knew through the press accounts that were being published at the time, which subsequent events have proved to be accurate in their reporting. He went to the Committee and he misled it as to the true status of a very expensive program which is crucial for the communications of the Australian defence forces. I do not believe he is stupid. This was a premeditated attempt to mislead the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not yet decided whether I will refer this matter to the Privileges Committee for an opinion but I want to use this opportunity to say to any witnesses in any department-and it is not a personal view-that the Senate will have no hesitation in applying the full weight of its powers to discipline those who transgress the basic principles outlined in the resolution of the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we have ferreted Government senators out of their offices and the billiard rooms of Parliament House they would do very well to stay in this chamber to listen to what I have to say. I wish to address the question of homeless youth in society. Many Labor electorates have this problem starkly in the streets. Homeless youth, or street kids as they are commonly known, are a serious social and economic problem for Australia. The issue was the subject of a Senate inquiry in 1982. The only member of that inquiry still a member of the Parliament is Senator Shirley Walters from Tasmania. She has been at the forefront in bringing this issue to the Parliament. I know she wishes no congratulations or thanks on this matter for her compassionate stance; all she really cares about is that someone from the Government side should do something about the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to take up the banner of this issue and bring it to the attention of the Parliament. I believe it is very much a symptom of modern Australia: Australia has not had such a problem in the past. Owing to good luck Australia has been relatively free of extreme poverty and ghetto living. We can no longer claim that that is the case. When the figure for homeless youth is 30,000, that is extreme poverty and ghetto living. Homeless youth range from the age of 10 to 18 years. But the age category can be broadened to 10 years to 25 years. Whilst homeless youth are not a homogenous group they share some common factors. They have been rejected by their families, either abused or victimised at home and are mostly economically and socially disadvantaged. Therein lies the problem. The common factor is their home life. A high percentage of homeless youth come from broken families and families undergoing crises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should reflect not only on the profile of our homeless youth but also on what that means to our society. These young people have no permanent shelter. Their shelter is either basic or they have none. The streets, the rubbish bins and the parks are where they sleep. They have no permanent employment. It is safe to say that they have no employment at all. To make money to be able to live, the worst cases will either thieve or turn to prostitution. As the Senate would be aware, turning to prostitution inevitably results in the use of drugs. The use of drugs inevitably results in drug peddling. So life becomes a downhill slide. In this state, they become exploited by adults in the pornography and drug underworld. The exploiters of these youth I would declare to be some of the most vile of our criminals. This problem in our society is compounding. It is a problem for all of us, as it affects all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic need of these youth is shelter. Shelter supplies them with a basic emotional and physical security. This security can be supplied through our Government's social welfare system, either by providing funds directly to the refuges, or by direct payments to youth through youth assistance schemes. Whatever scheme is implemented, it is necessary that all levels of government become involved in the welfare of this lost generation of Australians in a coordinated fashion, dedicated to relieving the plight of these homeless youth. This is a fundamental responsibility of all governments, not just for compassion's sake-compassion is easily felt-but also for the long term well-being and stability of our society. A proportion of the budget at every level of government must go towards solving this problem. I cannot imagine any Australian objecting to the use of government funds in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's support is most notable in a joint scheme between the Commonwealth and States, known as the supported accommodation assistance program, which incorporates not only the Federal Government and State governments but also local government and the numerous voluntary agencies. It provides funds for crisis accommodation and related support services for homeless people. Under the supported accommodation assistance program there is a subprogram directly tailored to homeless youth-the youth supported accommodation program. </PARA>
<PARA> Without doubt, these programs are necessary to help homeless youth, but even if the Government were to double its contributions it would not be getting to the substance of the problem or minimising it. It is recognised that many factors lead to homelessness. Indeed, I have outlined some of these factors already. Undoubtedly, the breakdown of the family unit perpetuated by the Family Law Act has been one of the major factors. However, another major factor, the new economic forces over the past six years, is what I particularly wish to concentrate on. Crucial to understanding the explosion of homelessness in society is the general downturn in the Australian economy over the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA> It surely must be recognised that Australia's economy has declined over the past six years. Its standard of living has declined. Australia has carried massive trade deficits over the past six years. Last month we faced a staggering figure of $1.7 billion. Australia is carrying a foreign debt of $115 billion, a growth from $32 billion in the past six years. Further to this, Australia has endured widely fluctuating interest rates and inflation rates. Short term interest rates in the past six years have reached as high as 20 per cent. Housing interest rates have reached 15 per cent. The inflation rate, whilst it sits at 7.5 per cent today, has reached the 10 per cent mark in the past six years. The value of the Australian dollar has also fluctuated over the past six years, falling from $1 per US dollar to 64c, rising to its level today of 87c Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> In volatile, troubled and uncertain economic times, it is always those on the bottom rung who are hit the hardest economically. Volatility is one of the most damaging factors for these people. All the prime indicators I have mentioned reflect upon the value of money. Those who are greatly disadvantaged in society lose more in proportion by a decrease in the value of money. There is little doubt that the greater the economic pressures placed upon a family, the greater the problem of homelessness will be. This is because of the tension that is brought into the home by economic failure. It is incumbent upon all governments to work toward establishing the fundamentals of the economy so as to support the family unit that, in turn, supports each individual within the family. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is happening to the family at the micro level? The family allowance is a miserable $7 per week per child. It has been that figure from day one of this Government. The dependent spouse rebate is a miserable $830 per year. That figure has also remained static. In 1983 the dependent spouse rebate for families with children was $963. In 1984, I concede that it went up to $1,030. But that is where it has been locked in. Over the past six years the family allowance has decreased in real terms by 32 per cent, the dependent spouse rebate by 32 per cent and the dependent spouse rebate for families with children by 27 per cent. The Government's attempt to target the poorer families by introducing the family allowance supplement has been a failure. The take-up rate of this allowance has been very low. It is little wonder. The introduction of an assets test upon the allowance supplement payment immediately eliminates most, if not all, poorer family farmers. Clearly, the cut-off figure of $300,000 for the capital value of the farm is too low. It is utterly unrealistic and destroys the hopes of so many family farmers who wish to raise their families in some security and with some peace of mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stated over the weekend that he intended to increase the family allowance supplement by a miserly $2. That is too little, too late. The family allowances and rebate payments are inadequate, cloaked as they are in this Government's tax system. The bulk of pay as you earn taxpayers are family men and women. The tax system over the past six years has seen over two million Australians pushed into the high tax bracket of 40c in the dollar. It is estimated that another one million Australians will enter those high tax brackets in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 tax on average weekly earning has increased by over 56 per cent. These staggering figures have had a very destructive effect upon the Australian family's standard of living. The neglect of the family in this way has been compared by Carl Anderson to the callous days of the Industrial Revolution. I quote from Carl Anderson's speech at the International Congress on the Family, which was held in Paris recently, because it is pertinent to the subject I address today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Contemporary Government neglect of the family bears a striking similarity to the mid-nineteenth century capitalist's view of men, women and children as autonomous members of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the crux of the argument I am trying to get through to the Government. Men, women and children are not autonomous members of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings us to the issue of the Government's child care policy. The Government's policy of subsidising particular child-care centres favours the better off in society and the double income families, over and above the single income families. Why should a mother who chooses to stay at home to care for the family be financially penalised? That analysis is backed up by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who has condemned this Government's own child-care policy. The only equitable and efficient alternative to the Government's current policy is additional child-care support for all mothers, either by way of direct payment or tax deduction per child. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of the Government's ill-directed child-care policy and the decline in the Government's family assistance measures, along with the overall decline in the economy over the past six years, has deepened the unemployment crisis of the young in Australia. For many young people homelessness and unemployment go hand in hand. It is a vicious cycle. To state the obvious, unemployment precludes many of these young people from affordable housing. Homelessness prevents young people from building a solid environment from which to obtain and remain in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The high level of youth unemployment is, of course, closely linked to the poor performance of the economy and to the consequent declining level of family income which has forced many mothers into the paid work force. Low income families are the first to be confronted with this financial decision that both parents should work. It should be clear-it is what I believe-that most women would prefer to stay at home to raise a family but are forced to work due to the economic plight their family has been placed in. Sadly, this has squeezed many young school leavers out of the employment market. </PARA>
<PARA> An array of examples can be given to show how the social welfare system, the tax system and the economic system of this Government are skewed against the traditional family unit. These economic effects upon the family unit constitute one of the major factors perpetuating the plight of homeless youth in our society. Their plight is one of the greatest social and economic challenges before Australia, particularly in a time when Australia is laying its economic foundations for the year 2000. Indeed, if genuine help is not given to these street kids we may not only be facing a devastating and depressing economic future but we will also be facing a very troubled and uneasy social future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the shadow Minister. Honourable senators present may be interested to know that since 1976, when this country was under the commendable leadership of Malcolm Fraser, there has been a system in operation whereby the States have allocated Commonwealth grants to local bodies on the recommendation of the State grants commissions. It was during the final year of operation of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1985-86 that an amendment to that Act brought in indexation. That amendment limited the total allocation in that year to $535m, which was 2 per cent in real terms over what had been allocated the year before. This amendment broke, for the first time, the relationship between personal income tax receipts and the amount which was allocated to local government. That system formed part of the relationship between Federal and local governments for some nine years. I think it is fair to say that it was a relationship which was mutually beneficial to both parties and which provided a clear guide to local governments as to the funds they were due to receive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986-87, following the National Inquiry into Local Government Finance headed by Professor Peter Self, the Commonwealth Government in its wisdom chose to quash the legislation which had been in operation since 1976. It introduced revised arrangements under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act. The allocation for the first two years of that Act was based on the previously allocated 1985-86 amount indexed against the consumer price index (CPI). </PARA>
<PARA> The breaking of the link between personal income tax receipts and the amount allocated to local government served to disadvantage local government. Those receipts increased at a greater rate than the CPI. As part of the new legislation State grants commissions were also required-perhaps a better word is forced-to formulate a new principle for approval by the Commonwealth Minister. The new principles under which the State grants commissions had to operate were based largely on guidelines which Commonwealth officers had prepared. As a result, State grants commissions were forced to alter fundamentally the way they allocated their grants from 1987 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State, the Tasmanian Grants Commission was no exception, with the Commission being required to make a number of important changes and modifications to the way it operated. Sensing that this would cause both the councils and the Grants Commission some concern, it was decided to phase in these new procedures over a three-year period. In Tasmania the 1987-88 allocation for the Commission was based on 80 per cent of the old system and 20 per cent of the new. For the year 1988-89 it will be 60 per cent and 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The change to a population basis by the Federal Government was finally achieved in the current financial year. The most significant disadvantage of this change was obviously incurred by Tasmania, although Western Australia and New South Wales also suffered to some extent. For 1988-89 the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act stipulates that the total amount of financial assistance to local government is to be arrived at by altering the amount for 1987-88 by the percentage change in Commonwealth general purpose grants to the States. Because of changes to the funding of hospital services agreed to in May 1988 at the Premiers Conference, there was a need to identify health grants. As a result, the Commonwealth has now amended the grant determination procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of these changes is that local government in Australia will be provided this year with a fixed amount of $652.5m. This represents a notional increase of $15.8m, or 2.5 per cent. The reality is that local government will be faced with a decrease of $22.4m, or 3.3 per cent, in comparison to what it received in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much, particularly from the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), about this Government's so-called commitment to local government. We heard a lot about that during the referendum debate. I challenge the Government to put its record in relation to local government up for public scrutiny because I sincerely believe that this Government is attempting to dupe local government by upholding itself as the benevolent provider on the one hand, but in reality doing very little. It is very easy to understand when one has contact with Senator Reynolds. She is a very charming lady. I am the first to admit that she has done a very good job of charming local government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least now we notice that local governments are starting to show their concern. My colleague from Tasmania quite rightly points out that the Minister may have charmed local government on the surface, but the people of Australian were not charmed during the referendum debate. A quick comparison of the level of Commonwealth funding to local government over the period 1976 to 1988 on the basis of a percentage of the previous personal income tax share arrangements reveals that funding peaked between 1980 and 1983 under Malcolm Fraser, when the level steadied at 2 per cent. Under Mr Hawke, in 1988-89 we see the funding level reduced to a pitiful 1.66 per cent. Tasmania's share of the total amount has been declining in recent years. As I have mentioned, under the provisions of the new Act, for example, in 1986-87 Tasmania received 3.17 per cent of the total pool, whereas for this year, 1988-89, the figure will fall to 2.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future looks even less favourable for local government in Tasmania. For ongoing years we will see local government receive a share based on population alone. All local governments in Tasmania are therefore facing real problems because of their declining share of Commonwealth assistance. It has been estimated that during 1988-89 Tasmania will receive $18.53m. This will be a reduction of around $603,000, or 3.2 per cent, and a real terms reduction of $1.75m, or 8.6 per cent. These figures indicate quite clearly that the position for Tasmania is particularly difficult, as the cutbacks imposed on local government in Tasmania have been 2 1/2 times as bad as those imposed on an Australia-wide basis. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting point which has emerged from a recent conference of all State grants commissions is that the South Australian Grants Commission gave notice that South Australia's State Treasury had recently raised with Mr Hawke the possibility of the Commonwealth undertaking a major review of the distribution of funds between the States. It is apparent that people within local government are not happy with these revised arrangements and, despite the protestations of the Government, they are proving to be far from equitable. In my capacity as secretary of the coalition's local government committee, I am continually receiving representations from local government all over Australia. Very serious problems have been brought to us by the Local Government Association of New South Wales. This week the Municipal Association of Victoria is waiting upon us, and I am pleased to say that we will be meeting with that association tomorrow. These groups all have the same concerns-not only in regard to their declining funding rates in general grants to the States but also in respect of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the State grants commissions are saying that if they themselves are being forced to distribute funds amongst the councils on an equalisation rather than on a per capita basis, surely the same principles must apply to the Commonwealth in its distribution of funds to the States. The Federal Government wants to deal with this matter in whatever way best suits its own objectives. It forces councils to distribute funds on an equalisation basis but refuses to acknowledge the same principles in its own distribution of funds amongst the States. Personally, I believe that Tasmania would fare much better under such a system than the 2.84 per cent which is currently being received under the per capita based distribution. I strongly urge that this Government examine the funding relativities which exist between the States. What is being sought here is really not unreasonable. It would bring the distribution of funds for local government into line with the methods used for the distribution of general revenue assistance amongst the various States and the Northern Territory and would therefore provide a more even outcome for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government continues to suffer under Mr Hawke. It has seen itself slowly shrinking away as a part of total public sector activities. Indeed, over the past two decades local government's share of taxes collected by all governments has dropped from 5.6 per cent to a measly 3.7 per cent as the Federal Government has increased its massive tax grab. The Federal Government's measures have hurt local government in Tasmania, and they will certainly continue to do so. I note with interest a press release from the office of Senator Reynolds herself, dated 22 August 1988. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania's share of financial assistance grants in 1988-89 decreased by 3.2% compared to an increase of 2.2% in 1987-88 and the national average increase this year of 2.5%. </PARA>
<PARA>So even the Minister for Local Government has agreed that Tasmania's share of financial assistance grants has decreased quite significantly. I think this is worth repeating because we can see that, while national funds have increased by 2.5 per cent, Tasmania's share has decreased by 3.2 per cent. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is from Tasmania, to take note of those figures. I am sure he must have been made aware of those figures by local government in Tasmania. I hope that he passes those concerns on to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of these measures are that only nine out of 46 Tasmanian councils have received even the slightest increase in their funds, while only one council will receive more in the next year than it did in real terms in 1987-88. That is an indictment of this Government's policy of reducing assistance to local government in Tasmania and in fact all over Australia. It is very easy to pass the buck to local governments, because they are the ones at the end of the line. We all know that it is politically expedient to get local government to increase its rates and make itself unpopular with the people. The Federal Government does not get the political flak and the blame for the effect of these measures on the family budget when the rate demands fall due. As I said before, it is local government that is at the end of the queue and that cops all the flak from the unfortunate decisions that are being made at a Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> In support of that suggestion I quote from the Burnie Advocate of Wednesday, 24 August. It is headed `Councils cheesed off by Federal grants cuts'. I know that very good cheese is made at Lactos in Burnie, but the councils certainly were not cheesed off in that way. According to the article, the Warden of the Waratah Council said that `some of the smaller jobs the council had planned would no longer go ahead'; at Penguin the Warden, E. Dyke, `described the cuts as ``very serious'' '; the Warden of Wynyard, Councillor Chalk, said `the cuts . . . would affect the municipality and make things difficult'; and Latrobe's Warden, Councillor Ford, said that `the $2065 cut had been expected and the council's budget had taken the cut into consideration'. But he said also that `one of the reasons rates continued to rise was to cover the decreases in Commonwealth funding'. We now move down the west coast to Strahan. We all know that Strahan is one of the smallest municipalities in Tasmania. Even there, the council clerk said that the cut would create difficulties. The Warden of Circular Head, Councillor O'Halloran, said `the cutback would mean a slight increase in rates'. The Burnie City Council was another cited. Moving to Devonport, Alderman Geoff Squibb said he believed Tasmania was being victimised. </PARA>

They are just some of the examples from the north-west and the west coast of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of this Government's blatant disregard for local government has been well documented. I do not wish to take up the Senate's time by repeating that history. I refer to the scrapping of the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations and the introduction of quarterly payments of grants, which was another way in which this Government conned local government. As I said earlier, Senator Reynolds did a very good snow job in that regard. Local governments used to receive their grants in one lump sum and had the opportunity to reinvest the money to their advantage. Now local governments will get it in quarterly payments, so another way of balancing their budgets has been taken away from them. </PARA>
<PARA> The receipt of a percentage of funds related to personal income tax-the most equitable way in which local governments had ever received funds-has been scrapped. The recent decision to remove the requirement that Australia Post and Telecom Australia pay local government rates was the greatest con job of all time. Local governments accepted this wonderful idea from Senator Reynolds. She told them, `You will be able to collect from Commonwealth properties the same rates that you charge all other private enterprises and people in the community'. But what happened? It was not very long before the Government decided to claw back and reduce its allocation of funding to those local governments by a very similar amount. The sad thing is that this will affect many country councils that do not have Commonwealth properties in their areas. The Government will reduce the amount of local government funding to the States by roughly the same proportion that local governments will receive in rates from Commonwealth properties. Those municipalities that do not have the advantage of having Commonwealth properties in their areas will be further affected by this measure. It is time that this Government woke up to itself in relation to its commitment to local government. In particular, it is time that the Government recognised why Tasmanian councils are facing the prospect of imposing massive rate hikes on the average ratepayer to absorb Federal cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with interest yesterday to Senator Panizza, a former local government identity from Western Australia. He commented on road funding. I do not intend to give a great discourse on road funding, but one fact that we should keep in mind is that, out of every 23.5c in fuel tax that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is taking at the bowser, local government is receiving 1c to maintain and improve its roads. The State governments receive about 4.95c for their roads. So out of that figure of 23.5c in fuel tax which the Government is thieving from the bowsers, from the people of Australia who are lucky enough to own cars, 1c is being given to local governments to maintain their roads, which are being used more and more these days by people trying to move their goods around the areas. That is another reason why local government is at the moment, and will continue to be, very disenchanted with the performance of this government in the allocation of funds to it. Local government is one of the so-called equal partners, as Senator Reynolds is always telling us. Well, the equal partner is getting a very small part of the cake. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in this cognate debate on the Appropriation Bills, I want to concentrate on matters that flowed from the Estimates committee hearings, in particular Estimates Committee A, dealing with the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. There were several things which worried members of the Committee and which I think are worthy of bringing to the attention of this chamber in a more detailed form. As a large amount of material was dealt with, I will restrict my remarks and perhaps have an opportunity, during the committee stage, to expound on some points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin with the Department of Industrial Relations. I will look at the Estimates committee hearings which took place in April 1988, when for the first time an item appeared in the papers put forward for scrutiny for a sum of $9,300-odd which had been paid, or was to be paid, by way of compensation under a code of conduct set up by the Government to deal with industrial problems occurring during the deregulation of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), particularly in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that code of conduct, to which employers were required to subscribe, an undertaking was given that compensation would be paid to employers who suffered loss or damage because of harassment from the BLF or from its members. It also excluded from its operation any employers who had been involved in secret commission payments, or anything of that kind, so they were bona fide employers of good faith who were to maintain the law, to operate in the most efficient way they could, and to receive compensation from the Government in the event that they suffered loss. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988 I asked what action was being taken by the Department to recover that sum of approximately $10,000 from the BLF, which had funds secreted away or banked in some mysterious fashion-at least, the funds were in existence-and I further asked what care and attention was being taken by the Department to recover that money. We did not hear from the Department until just prior to the meeting of Estimates committees in this session. The information that came back was, very simply, that there were no provisions for the Government to recover the money from the BLF because no legal work had been done by the Department to make a binding contract which, either by subrogation or by other contractual means, would enable the Commonwealth to take action against BLF funds. </PARA>
<PARA> When I became aware of this advice, which was given by the Australian Government Solicitor, my question was this: was it by accident or design that this money was not able to be recovered from the BLF? That is to say, was it deliberate government policy that this money should not be recovered or was it negligence on the part of the Department which had failed to provide the mechanism to provide the means of getting that money back?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister who was on duty was Senator Button. He undertook to find out whether it was by accident or design; that is, whether it was government policy or negligence on the part of the Department. We have to this date had no reply as to whether it was by accident or design. By persistent questioning of departmental heads, I was able to ascertain, that, far from the rather small sum of $10,000 referred to in April 1988, the projected cost of this scheme was now between $2m and $3m of taxpayers' money. We had gone from finding that a sum of nearly $10,000 had not been recovered to finding that a sum of nearly $3m was not capable of recovery. Interestingly, upon further questioning of departmental officers, I was able to ascertain that the accumulated funds of the BLF were probably also somewhere between $2m and $3m. Had the Commonwealth been able to recoup the money that it had expended because of the action of members of the BLF, those BLF funds would have been effectively wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask again-and I think this chamber is entitled to an answer-whether it was by accident or design. Was it deliberate government policy that prevented legal action being taken concerning the BLF's funds or was it negligence on the part of the Department? Whichever is the answer, neither is satisfactory. It is not satisfactory for the Government to make a political decision that it will spend some $2m to $3m of taxpayers' money without making a provision to get it back from the people who caused the damage in the first place. Neither is it satisfactory to have an answer that it was negligence on the part of the Department, because under the Westminster system obviously the Minister is responsible for ensuring that the proper legal work is carried out to enable action to be taken to recover that money. So we are still waiting with bated breath. Is it accident or is it design? Did the Government deliberately spend some $2m to $3m of taxpayers' money to compensate people for damage caused by the BLF, or was the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, sufficiently negligent in his duty not to have overseen the actions of his Department to ensure that the required legal mechanisms were put in place? That is a matter which remains extant. It is a matter on which we will still press for an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter relating to industrial relations concerns the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It came to my attention via the well-known grapevine in this place that one senior officer of that Commission commuted regularly between Sydney and Canberra. On my original hearing of the story that took place on a daily basis. However, I was assured that it was not on a daily basis but on a weekly basis, and that this had been going on since some time in October 1987. There has been a change in the head of the Commission in that time, and on cross-examination of witnesses who were giving evidence to the Committee it became apparent that the current Chairman did not approve of this arrangement and would never have sanctioned it. Nonetheless, it was still in place as late as 18 October 1988. I know that because in questioning those officers I asked for further information; that is, for the cost of that commuting, which was incurred simply because the person in question did not wish to move. I asked the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to provide the cost of Canberra-Sydney-Canberra travel, including the travelling allowance, for the Commission's Deputy Director. I asked for that information to be provided separately for the period following the issue of a transfer notice and the period following its withdrawal. The answer which has come back states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Director was, in fact, issued with notification on 16 October 1987 for a fixed term of 3 years from January 1988. The transfer was indefinitely postponed on 8 January 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount paid for travel including travelling allowance for the respective periods is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Period 16 October 1987-7 January 1988-$940.84</PARA>
<PARA> Period 8 January 1988-18 October 1988-$22,299.69. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, that is an unconscionable expenditure of public moneys. Quite clearly, and on the evidence given, there was a dissatisfaction with the arrangement expressed by the current head of the Commission. Nonetheless, this arrangement was entered into as early as October 1987 and allowed to drag on to date. </PARA>
<PARA> I have further questions: is this arrangement still in place? What is the future of the arrangement? Do any other people have this arrangement? At a time when people are being told that it is necessary to tighten the belt, to make sacrifices, how can the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) possibly sanction the expenditure of $22,299.69 because somebody does not want to move from Canberra to Sydney when he is given a further posting? What sort of scrutiny, what sort of ministerial responsibility, is taken in this matter? We are yet to see whether it is still on foot. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter to which I refer is one that is raised not in the Opposition senators' dissenting or minority report, known as a reservation, and in which the matters to which I have already referred have been raised, but in the body of the report itself. It relates to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and in particular to the offsets and partnership for development programs, a matter which has been the subject of discussion in this chamber on a great number of occasions for the simple reason that there seems in this respect to have been government by press release rather than government by substance. Several things were drawn to the attention of the Committee and came out in fairly strong cross-examination of people who appeared before it. One of the things of concern, which is dealt with in the body of the main report, relates to a practice which seems to have been allowed to develop whereby senior officers from the Department who have been the originators or the instigators of these programs have gone into the private sector taking with them the expertise that they may have gained in the Department, and perhaps specialised knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Without imputing motives either to future employers or to the people concerned, the important point to be made is this: if the offsets and partnership for development programs are to have any place and are to be of any value, they must been seen as fair dinkum policies, not simply as methods of favouring, or in any way appearing to favour, people who export goods from this country which are purchased by government. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to stress is this: the offsets and partnership for development programs-which I have to say are suspect in themselves in that there seems to be no initiative on the part of government to make people comply with their offsets commitments, and one could be excused for saying that the partnership for development program might be a mechanism for allowing people to find a way around being involved in the offsets commitment-must be administered scrupulously. There needs to be one set of rules, one set of criteria. To have people leaving the Department and going straight to the private sector-in one case a person was held out as having expertise and having come from that source-so that in some way someone might get a competitive edge, I think, is unacceptable. Attention was drawn to this in the report, and it was pointed out that perhaps some way of preventing such transfers should become part of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I want to mention-I will be brief because I hope that at some stage in the future we will have an opportunity to have some sort of full-scale investigation-relates to the Australian Bicentennial Authority (ABA). In the reservation report Opposition senators have set out in some detail the consequences that flowed from hearings concerning the ABA that took place on 19 October 1987 when, in answer to a question that I asked of Mr Kirk, the Chairman, about efficiency audits being carried out on the ABA, Mr Kirk advised in evidence that such an efficiency audit had in fact taken place. It was not until the beginning of 1988 when I received correspondence from the Auditor-General's Department informing me that no such efficiency audit had ever taken place, that a rather sad story started to unravel. That simply is this: the ABA has been structured in such a way that the Attorney-General's Department has interpreted that structure as placing the ABA outside the ambit of the Auditor-General to conduct an efficiency audit unless he has permission of the auditee. This is a legal opinion which the Attorney-General has twice given in the sense that he has said that the ABA is not controlled by the Commonwealth. His rather tortuous opinion goes precisely this way: it says that because a majority of the directors of the ABA have not been appointed as individuals by the Commonwealth, somehow the ABA itself is not under the control of the Commonwealth. Prior to the restructuring of the Board it was under the control of the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth appointed all the directors, but when the restructuring took place some of the directors were in fact representative directors of groups and therefore could not be said to be under the direct control of the Commonwealth. That is a spurious argument, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA> The same argument was used in respect of the freedom of information (FOI) legislation when, for the same reasons, the Attorney-General said that the ABA was not to be subject to that legislation. That story went even further. Because of that spurious opinion, the Government then sought to table a regulation which took the ABA off the schedule of the freedom of information legislation. That was meant to mean that no applications for FOI could be entertained. When a fuss was made the Government said it would introduce remedial legislation to ensure that the ABA was subject to freedom of information legislation. Having done that, it then made a regulation to take the ABA off the schedule and in its wisdom this Senate disallowed that regulation. Guess what! We have seen no remedial legislation. The ABA is still on the schedule, but it is very selective and very cost-efficient-or rather, cost-officious-as to who shall get information from it and who shall not. </PARA>
<PARA> Many sorry stories have emanated from the ABA. Perhaps the most notorious is the story of the First Fleet re-enactment which was denied support and yet miraculously still sailed into Sydney Harbour on Australia Day and made that day in terms of the emotion, the spectacle and the wonder of Sydney Harbour crowded with boats, people and celebrators. But there are more sad and sorry stories. Every day one encounters the dictatorial way in which the ABA has acted towards small people who had a contribution which they thought was worthwhile making. At the beginning of the next century we will celebrate Federation and, again, some sort of body will administer that celebration. There is a need to have some sort of accountability of the ABA in a forum that this Senate may consider suitable. That matter is yet to be determined. </PARA>

It has not been satisfactorily accountable. The regulatory audits which the Auditor-General can and does carry out are not enough. An efficiency audit was needed and it was first asked for in 1986. Only by having efficiency audits and by seeing the manner in which decisions were arrived at, whether they were the right decisions, will we have a satisfactory blueprint in place so that we do not make the same mistakes again. The Estimates committees offer members of this chamber the opportunity to see behind the decisions of government. They are a very important part of the democratic process. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak on some of the matters that were important to me and to my fellow senators when we took evidence in this last series of hearings. I look forward to the committee stages of the Appropriation Bills when, perhaps, we can look at other things in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the initial stages of the World Heritage listing we received a number of commitments from the Government, from various Ministers, that the World Heritage listing would not take place unless it had the support of the Queensland Government. In 1984 the Australian Heritage Commission suggested that Australia should nominate the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland for World Heritage listing. In July 1984 State and Federal Government Ministers agreed on future procedures for the listing of World Heritage sites at the meeting of the State Council of Nature and Conservation Ministers. That agreement stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government has indicated that it will not take unilateral action to nominate areas for World Heritage listing without the agreement of the State or Territory concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first broken promise. Only two or three months later, on 12 September 1984, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to the Queensland Premier reinforcing the statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the intention of my Government to take unilateral action to nominate the region for World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another broken promise, not only by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) but also by the Prime Minister of this nation, in writing. On 11 February 1986 Senator Ryan, speaking on behalf of the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Environment, told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has made it clear that the wet tropical rainforest of north-east Queensland will only be nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List with the agreement of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Never at any time was any agreement given by the Queensland Government to allow the listing of the north Queensland rainforests. For nearly two years the Queensland Government has been saying that it will not accept World Heritage listing, only for it to be pursued by Senator Richardson who is determined to go ahead and list 900,000 hectares of Queensland's rainforests. In a spirit of compromise the Queensland Government said to Senator Richardson that it would accept allocating 60 per cent of the rainforest area for World Heritage listing. Forty per cent was to be under State Government control, and 28 per cent was to be in national parks and timber reserve areas. Only 13.2 per cent of the national rainforest estate would be logged. That was the Queensland Government's compromise, but this was not sufficient for the Federal Government. The recommendations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) to the World Heritage Commission were:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . future management arrangements for the area. The Bureau noted that consultations were under way on the establishment of a joint Commonwealth/Queensland management authority to administer the site which were expected to be completed in September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendations also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . revision of the delimitation of the nominated area in order to make the nomination more coherent. The Bureau considered this revision was required in order to trim the boundaries to make the site a more manageable conservation unit, and to exercise areas where human modification was judged unacceptable and to omit areas which did not contribute significant natural value. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That compromise resulted in the Federal Government trimming the boundaries by one per cent. The compromise certainly was not in the spirit of the recommendations. The Federal Government was prepared to offer only one per cent as a compromise to the Queensland Government. Despite the fact that the Queensland Government did not wish to go ahead with World Heritage nomination it made a significant compromise to allow 60 per cent of the World Heritage area to be listed, with 28 per cent to go into national park and timber reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> The boundaries were trimmed by one per cent; 31 pieces of land were excised; and eight new areas were included in the boundaries. Those boundaries have never been before this House of Parliament. Those boundaries have no protection under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. I have continually asked Senator Richardson to bring before this Parliament, and to allow for debate, the listing of those boundaries. Senator Richardson has not done that. He is now going to the World Heritage Committee in Paris seeking to nominate boundaries that have not even been before this Parliament. Those boundaries have no protection whatsoever. Only a matter of two or three weeks ago logging was taking place in that unprotected area. Those boundaries have never been before this Parliament and have never received Executive Council approval; yet between 5 December and 8 December the Minister will be seeking in Paris to include those boundaries on the World Heritage List, completely ignoring this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We in Australia have a proud record of parliamentary democracy. Yet Senator Richardson is usurping our authority and is seeking to have the World Heritage Committee endorse those boundaries. How can he bypass this Parliament? How can he guarantee that those boundaries will be accepted by the Parliament? Clearly, he is stepping around this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important recommendation of the IUCN to the World Heritage Bureau was that it was essential that a joint management authority be established between the Federal Government and the Queensland Government to manage the 900,000 hectares that were to be listed. No joint management authority is in place and there is no plan to take before the World Heritage Committee. Since 30 September this year there have been no negotiations between the State and Federal governments. Since then negotiations have broken down, despite the fact that the Queensland Government suggested in its submission that the nomination cover only 60 per cent of the land and that only 13.4 per cent of the total area be logged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, with Senator Richardson leading the charge, will present a plan to the World Heritage Bureau in Brasilia. But there is no plan, there is no joint management authority, to manage that vast area. There are no boundaries in place. Senator Richardson should have been forced by his own Party-certainly by Senator Reynolds, who is supposed to represent north Queensland but who is not very effective-to bring the matter before this Parliament so that those boundaries could have been discussed. If the Queensland Government was not prepared to join the Federal Government in submitting a plan to the World Heritage Bureau, legislation should have been brought before this House to give to the Federal Government power to manage that vast area of Queensland under Commonwealth regulation. It should have been debated in this House. It should have been allowed to come into this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question I asked Senator Richardson only on Friday, he said, `Of course, the Queensland Government will submit. When we get back, World Heritage will be a fait accompli and, if it does not submit and join us in managing that area under a joint management authority, it will not get $75m'. By any criterion that is blackmail in its worst form. When the Queensland Government delegation goes before the World Heritage Bureau in Brasilia, it will show the Bureau a copy of the Hansard to show it what sort of compromise, what sort of spirit of joining together, Senator Richardson showed to allow a joint management authority to manage that vast area. The Bureau will see in that record that Senator Richardson held out $75m and said, `If there is no joint authority, Queensland will not get $75m, and we will not give the people of north Queensland $75m worth of job and industry assistance'. That is blackmail. It cannot be termed anything other than blackmail. I believe the World Heritage Bureau will see it for what it is: the bully-boy tactics of Senator Richardson, trying to ride roughshod over a democratically elected government and, worse than that-if there is anything worse than that-over a democratically elected Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Richardson had any honesty about him, he would have brought the issue of the boundaries in here and we would have had the chance to disallow them after 15 sitting days. But no, we were not able to do that. I suspect the reason is that Senator Richardson has been under so much pressure lately from Caucus that he was not game to open the debate in this Federal Parliament again. People on the other side of the chamber are so embarrassed about the loss of 2,000 jobs, the loss of a $33m industry, and the loss of people's homes. Fourth generation, proud forestry workers, people who have the experience and skill to log, are now reduced to picking up papers on the side of the road. I do not believe Senator Richardson had the courage to bring those boundaries before this House and have them debated. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to World Heritage Bureau recommendations, the Government submitted a report called The Wet Tropics of Queensland-A Report to the World Heritage Committee Secretariat in which it said clearly:</PARA>
<PARA> If the State Government is unable to participate in co-operative arrangements, the existing interim arrangements will be adapted to provide long-term Federal management arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>In that report a diagram shows how the federal management structure for the wet tropics will work. It shows at the top the Federal Minister responsible for the environment and under him the Director of the federal rainforest agency. Under that is the staff of the federal rainforest agency, with the Community and Scientific Consultative Committee to the left. If Senator Richardson is going to use that federal management structure to manage the 900,000 hectares of rainforest, and if he is not prepared to bring that structure before parliament and have it debated by the democratically elected members-I represent the State of Queensland and I should have a vote on this; Senator Reynolds represents the State of Queensland and she should have a vote on this-he is denying the people of Queensland an opportunity to have a say through their democratically elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to say that this federal management structure will not be accepted by this Parliament? Senator Richardson is clearly pre-empting the decisions of this Federal Parliament. I hope that the World Heritage Committee will take those two facts into consideration before it makes a decision. In effect, this Government is usurping the decisions and the power of this Parliament if it allows that World Heritage nomination to go forward without the decision being made in this Parliament. That, I believe, will not reflect kindly on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or on any other committee. I know that UNESCO is embarrassed about the decision to nominate this area for the World Heritage List. It has sent back notes that have come out in publicity saying, `For goodness sake, we are not here to decide Australia's domestic problems'. It is embarrassed about this, and well it should be, because it has been put in the terrible position of one elected government having been overruled by the Federal Parliament of Australia. There is a big power play between Senator Richardson, who will crash or crash through, and the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put it clearly on the record that the Queensland Government has managed its forests and its rainforests with great skill. That has been acknowledged by some of the best scientific brains in the world. It has been able to sustain the yield of timber coming from the rainforests to provide 2,500 jobs, to provide a $33m industry, and to provide a decent lifestyle for many people, many towns, and many shires.

So out of the $180,000 that Senator Reynolds is going to distribute around north Queensland, $120,000 will end up in the Chisholm Institute of Technology in Melbourne. That is perfectly correct; I have checked that. So, out of the $180,000, $60,000 will go to the workers of north Queensland to identify business opportunities. I say to Senator Reynolds that if she knew the first thing about business she would know that if there were business opportunities in north Queensland they would have been taken up by enterprising north Queenslanders who would have established businesses there. Senator Reynolds is going to try to put artificial jobs in place, and that will not work. So the $75m that has been promised as compensation to the people of north Queensland, the first shot to have been fired, has been a dismal failure. Out of the $180,000 that was to go to the people of north Queensland they will end up with $60,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other area I want to address in my contribution tonight relates to the World Heritage Committee. One of its recommendations was that land owned by Aboriginal people and private citizens and land used for military training should not have World Heritage listing. There is an Aboriginal community just south of Cairns called Yarrabah. Half of the land of that community is going under World Heritage listing. I have received assurances from Senator Richardson that the Aborigines will be able to maintain that land for traditional uses such as cutting timber for their artefacts, housing and so forth. But the Queensland Government is trying to encourage these people to be self-sufficient, to grow things, to run cattle and dairy herds, to use that very good land to develop their own industries. Those people have 8,000 hectares out of their 15,000 hectares locked up. They will never be able to use that land except for traditional purposes. That is not in the best interests of our Aboriginal people. They should be encouraged, as the Queensland Government is encouraging them, to go out and do something with that land-to run cattle, to grow things. But the Government has made sure that 8,000 hectares of that land will never be touched. It will not be able to be used other than to provide a bit of timber to make Aboriginal artefacts. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole story of World Heritage listing is very sad because there has been so much misrepresentation; we have compromised the World Heritage Committee. I can understand its having said to Australia, `Please do not send any more of these troubles over for us to sort out. Please do not send your domestic problems over here'. In the last few minutes available to me I say to the World Heritage Committee, as forcefully and with as much enthusiasm as I can, that the Queensland Government has made a compromise: 60 per cent of 900,000 hectares is to be locked away forever under World Heritage listing; 28 per cent of the 900,000 hectares is to go into national parks and timber reserves; and 13.4 per cent is to be logged to sustain 2,000 jobs, to sustain a $33m industry. That is a great compromise by the Queensland Government, in direct opposition to what the Federal Government has done. It has reduced the 980,000 hectares by one per cent. That is the compromise that Senator Richardson has offered. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again to the World Heritage Committee: `Do not usurp the Australian people's Parliament. If Senator Richardson wants World Heritage listing let him go to you with boundaries that are accepted by this Parliament. If he wants to manage the World Heritage listing area of 900,000 hectares of north Queensland rainforest, let him go to you with a plan that has gone before the two Houses of Parliament. For the World Heritage Committee to do anything else is clearly usurping and taking away the rights of the Australian people. If those boundaries and the management plan go through the Parliament the Australian people, through their democratically elected representatives, will have had their say and Senator Richardson can go to the Committee fairly and say, `We have put this through the democratic process of the Australian Parliament'. But Senator Richardson can make no such claim. He has bypassed this Parliament. He has squibbed it on the boundaries and on the management authority. He is not game to bring before this Parliament again an open debate on this very contentious issue because the Australian Labor Party is running scared. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see the embarrassment when I speak on this issue. People opposite hang their heads in shame, as well they might, when we say to them, `You have taken away the jobs from your fellow unionists, those people who have paid $180 a year to send you here to represent them. You have reduced these people to picking up papers on the side of the road'. Honourable senators opposite hang their heads in shame, and if I were in their position I would be very embarrassed. Senator Richardson has tried to crash through. He has embarrassed his fellow Labor Party colleagues. He has certainly lost two seats in north Queensland for them. Senator Reynolds has sat here and listened to the debate. I have never heard her say one word in support of her north Queensland constituents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased tonight to participate in this debate on the Appropriation Bills before the Parliament, which are the very important Budget Bills of this Government. In addition, I want to address a number of comments in the course of my speech to the amendment that has been circulated by Senator Chaney. That amendment pays particular regard to just how out of touch the Hawke Labor Government is, its failure in the areas of economic policy and in particular the maladministration in areas such as Aboriginal affairs and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The amendment that Senator Chaney has distributed on behalf of the Opposition highlights an issue of major concern to me and the constituency of the Northern Territory that I represent; that is, the issue of this Labor Government raising, then dashing, Aboriginal expectations with unrealistic and divisive promises of national land rights and a so-called treaty and the appalling mismanagement, at both ministerial and bureaucratic levels, of Aboriginal affairs. Senator Chaney's amendment, quite rightly, reflects upon community values, the delivery of government services to guarantee improved living standards, and the fact that the Hawke Labor Government is totally out of touch with the general hopes and aspirations of Australian citizens and, in particular, Aboriginal citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last day or so the media has reported that a new Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-Mr Bill Gray-has been appointed. I know Mr Bill Gray, and I am very pleased with his appointment. I believe that he will bring to this position a reputation of not only being, as one newspaper report said, a shrewd, behind-the-scenes operator with a low public profile but also certainly having a great wealth of experience in this portfolio. I know that Mr Gray will be mindful of the events of the last month or so when this issue has attracted such public attention. It has attracted public attention not because of Mr Gray's role but because of the inadequacies of the administration that he has now inherited and because of the lack of control in this area by the Hawke Labor Government and, in particular, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. I will be pleased to work with Mr Gray. I trust that he will take up the mantle and address the very serious problems that have been raised in the last month. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a wealth of correspondence and contact from all over Australia in the last month. I have not counted the number of phone calls, letters and representations that I have received, but they would be in the order of several hundred. Just about everyone has been encouraging the stance that the Opposition has taken in seeking to expose the inadequacies and the maladministration of this portfolio. I refer to one letter from a person I thoroughly respect. He expressed the conviction that some housekeeping was certainly needed and said that he hoped it would go far enough, as earlier inquiries by the Hawke Labor Government had certainly not done so. He went on in his letter to speak of a `new paternalism' that avoids tough action in dealing with Aboriginal administration. That is what I hope Mr Gray will be able to address, particularly as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has now-at last-taken an interest in this portfolio. He has seen the inadequacies that exist in the portfolio. The Prime Minister must now share the concerns about its maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to guarantee that in the future we develop Aboriginal leadership within Australia that gives to Aboriginal people qualities that we would want in our leadership. Without good leadership, the goals that anybody sets-Mr Gray, as the new departmental head, Mr Hand as the Minister, or the Government-cannot be achieved no matter what their resources are. The leadership that emerges throughout the Aboriginal bureaucracy of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs must reflect sound values. We do not want alcoholics and embezzlers. We are looking for people with sound family backgrounds who are confident in themselves and who have the motivation and commitment to bring total Aboriginal advancement-not just to a particular family clan group, as has so often been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to address the fact that a multiplicity of services and their delivery have caused the very problems of lack of government control and past maladministration. It has been reckoned to me by one of the people who have written to me during the month that in the Northern Territory there are some 70 agencies promoting Aboriginal development, and often Aboriginal communities have to face up to 15 of these agencies in any one week. As my correspondent said, how would we get on with a marriage guidance counsellor living with us in our lounge room? He said, `I reckon we would be divorced in no time'. That is what has happened in the last month or so. In the Senate Estimates Committee D hearings we have been able to divorce, at last, some of these issues from the Minister, Mr Hand. He has acted as the marriage guidance counsellor with a paternalism whereby he has sought to sit in the lounge rooms, or the humpies, of Aboriginal people living in remote communities. It is this paternalism that I was attacking. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Senate Estimates Committee hearings over a month ago, I put some 400 questions on notice. During the hearings of the Senate Estimates Committee, I tackled 250 additional questions. My colleagues Senator Durack and Senator Short also took up a number of other issues just as I know you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator Boswell, in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, have also been actively pursuing these issues, issues that need to be addressed. What has been the final Government response? We now have seven inquiries in place into the administration of Aboriginal affairs. The Government did not have the guts or the courage to face up to the judicial inquiry that the Opposition called for and felt was most needed. Instead, it put in place four Public Service inquiries. It called in the Auditor-General. It called in the Public Service Commissioner. It called in the Department of Finance special investigator. It called in a Mr Menzies to look at the other issues. All of these inquiries will be fine. They will flow through, I hope, with public reports to this Parliament early next year. The issues that have been raised are so serious that they must be debated here subsequently. We have not yet been given that assurance. Anybody who wants to make submissions to any of these four inquiries does not enjoy the protection they could have enjoyed had there been a judicial and independent inquiry. Again, the Government is resorting to a camouflage. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are three parliamentary inquiries under way. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and Senator Boswell, as I have said, serve on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. This Committee was brought about because the Labor Government was attempting to bulldoze through this Parliament proposals for a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) that were totally out of kilter with the Australian community and certainly out of balance with the Aboriginal community. A special Senate inquiry is now necessary into several matters of privilege that have arisen from the Estimates hearings. In addition, the House of Representatives, through its Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, has in place a committee that is looking into the infrastructure of community services for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Seven inquiries are currently necessary because of the total inadequacy in addressing this portfolio by Mr Hand and the Labor Government. Is it any wonder that staff are resigning in droves from Department of Aboriginal Affairs offices throughout Australia and from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC)? How can these senior public servants, who have given a lifetime of commitment to the Australian Government, look back on their careers and plan for their futures and the contribution they want to make when they are aware that this Government has had absolutely no confidence or any record of achievement in this portfolio in the last five years?</PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) have continually taken the line that Senator Short and I, by being very active in our questioning on this issue in the Estimates Committee, were abusing our position of privilege. Mr Snowdon said on 24 November:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few weeks he-</PARA>
<PARA>he was referring to me-</PARA>
<PARA>has undertaken a campaign, along with his colleagues, deliberately to belittle people and has demonstrated a clear lack of integrity by using his position of privilege in the Senate in a way which I can only describe as jumping into the gutter of racial division and character assassination for cheap and cynical political point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA>What utter, absolute, blatant rubbish! At no time has Mr Snowdon or Mr Hand attempted to come in with constructive and proper reactions to those issues that we were raising. There was no attempt to create racial division or to engage in character assassination whatsoever. If people got caught up in the maladministration and were named, they have to live with the consequences. It is for this Labor Government to walk away from its racist attitudes because it has set out on a policy of separatism, of separate development of Aboriginal people, out of kilter with the rest of Australia. When some of us jump and say, `Hey, this is the line you are taking', what does the Government do? It says that we are smearing all Aboriginals. What utter and absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Hand's response has been a weak cover-up of only part of the problem. It is still a national scandal. The fact that Mr Hawke, behind the Minister's back, has had to resort to four Public Service inquiries, plus of course the three parliamentary ones, highlights the particular problems. The lousy and inefficient administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs by the then Secretary, Charles Perkins, is still suspiciously overlooked. Where is the support or the loyalty for the genuinely hard-working staff-the great majority-throughout the portfolio? What this Government has failed to do is to see the poverty, the illiteracy and the poor health of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. Instead, it has been concentrating on political power games and not fixing the very desperate needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports of the Senate Estimates Committee highlight this problem in great detail. The majority report identified many of the areas where there needed to be savings. It identified areas in departmental administration where there also needed to be an improvement in recruiting and staffing practices. It also identified areas where there is abuse of departmental resources. The Committee recommended that a number of issues that were raised, most importantly, by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association (ACOA)-the major Public Service union of Australia-needed to be addressed. Mr Hand had flippantly picked up the ACOA letter and responded to it without referring it properly to the Department for corrective action. That ACOA letter-I am sure my colleague Senator Short will refer to it in more detail when he speaks in this debate-referred to recruitment and staffing practices; the malpractices which were not regularly disclosed; the alarming loss of morale that is claimed by some officers to lead to conspicuous inefficiencies; the recruitment by unconventional means of public servants who were not competent to perform their duties; the misuse of travelling allowances and financial provisions; and the issue of patronage. </PARA>
<PARA> They were all issues raised by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. We addressed them in a Senate select committee, which is the proper and appropriate place to do it. What do the Minister, Mr Hand, and Mr Snowdon do about it? They get up and say we are smearing Aboriginals. How far from the truth can one go? They cannot see what they are looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues have been raised and there is no reason for any group, Aboriginal or otherwise, to resort to excuses. We drew attention to a whole series of scandals and rorts that reflected on the maladministration by Mr Hand and, to a certain extent, by Mr Perkins. Of course, Perkins took the chop because the Minister did not want to face up to the embarrassment of what he should have done and publicly resign. Mr Perkins took the chop as a result of what had happened at the Woden Town Club in terms of poker machines. Certainly that major scandal was a factor. But Mr Hand was also totally involved and had been briefed on it from day one. He could not tell the difference between a loan guarantee and a grant. He kept hiding behind the fact that he thought a loan guarantee was not going to be called up. Of course we all know that it was called up. In the end the Government, through the Aboriginal Development Commission, put over $900,000 into its Aboriginal social club in Canberra. What lousy, rotten priorities when there are people dying in outback Australia, when there are people living in dreadful housing conditions and when the illiteracy of Aboriginal children still has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other scandals have been made public over the last month. Directors of various companies have been playing ducks and drakes in respect of the Nardoola property. The Oasis Hotel was given away as a result of action by Mr Perkins. I have spoken previously in the Senate chamber about the Charleville Housing Association in Queensland. The Association was directed by Sugar Ray Robinson, a most unsavoury character and a confidant of both the Minister, Mr Hand, and the Secretary, Mr Perkins. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middair company in Western Australia, which was involved in the promotion of Aboriginal dance, is again another unresolved issue. Tranby College in Sydney, into which $500,000 of taxpayers' funds was channelled, was used by the Government to sell a treaty around Australia. This is another scandal. I have just received in recent days answers to a number of questions raised. One of the questions I put on notice was:</PARA>
<PARA> In legal terms under the ADC Act, is Tranby College a body with which the ADC could have dealings:</PARA>
<PARA>What is the answer? The answer is:</PARA>
<PARA> In legal terms, no. The College does not meet the Aboriginal objects clause required under Section 4 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet half a million dollars has been committed to enable that organisation to go out and promote a treaty. Of course Tranby College has had dubious connections with the left wing union politics of Australia. It has tenuous octopus links with Cuba and Nicaragua. </PARA>
<PARA> The network of mates and cronies run by Mr Perkins and Mr Hand defies description. Undue influence was certainly used continually in the administration of this Department at the expense of the Aboriginal people who are being denied housing, health and proper education. The recent sit-in at the ADC office after Mr Perkins was sacked, of course, highlighted the problem. What did some of Mr Hand's acquaintances do? They went out and bought cheese, biscuits and cakes for the people who were engaging in an illegal demonstration in a government office. They also gave them open access to telephones. Is that any way to carry on?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I have received dozens, if not hundreds, of submissions, the vast majority of which I am passing directly to the Auditor-General because I cannot trust the Minister, Mr Hand, to deal with them properly. I am passing them straight to the Auditor-General for investigation. To give an example of just how serious this involvement is, let me quote from one of those submissions. A 69-page submission concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>We have made this submission as private citizens and due to the potential threat of violence to our immediate families we trust that you will ensure that the source of this information remains confidential. </PARA>
<PARA>I tore the names and addresses of those people off the bottom of that document before I passed it on to the Public Service Commissioner and the Auditor-General. These people, who feel so seriously about this issue, are employees of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission was functioning very well before May 1988. Minister Hand did not like the way in which it was putting up alternative views about a particular thing. He was saying that he wanted Government and community consultation with Aboriginal people. So he walked in and he sacked all of the commissioners that he had the power to sack. He threw them out. What happened? The eight new commissioners that were appointed did not file their pecuniary interest forms until after the Senate Estimates committee hearings in the last month. In fact, Mr Perkins did not even file his until after he was sacked-and that became apparent through the questioning. </PARA>
<PARA> These people operated totally unprofessionally and without any regard to their position. At the Senate Estimates Committee hearings it was obvious to us that they operated without proper paperwork and without looking at things in detail. There was a great deal of intimidation of the Chairman, Mrs McPherson, who is one of the most outstanding Aboriginal leaders in Australia. She has had the courage to stand up to Minister Hand, stick by her principles and hold her position. What has she copped in return? She has copped nothing but denigration, lack of support and in fact smear. The General Manager of the ADC, Mr Mick O'Brien, has been pushed around. He has been accused of all sorts of unsavoury and unnecessary actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only were there peculiar circumstances surrounding the board meetings for the last six months but there were also very suspicious circumstances with regard to the appointment of the new Acting General Manager, when a crony of Mr Perkins, grabbed out of the Perth office, was pushed into that acting position as part of the duckshoving. Of course, it is very questionable who knew what and whether involvement in this matter reached right into the Minister's office. There are just so many interesting revelations that we should be looking at in this whole area of waste and maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I continue to say, the people who are missing out because of the wastage and the duplication of funds are the Aboriginal communities. Of the 230,000 Aboriginal people around Australia, some 60,000 live traditional lifestyles in outback Australia. The balance, of course, are to a large extent urbanised. There is, of course, a very big inbuilt conflict between the traditional and the Aboriginal administration of this port- folio. That is what the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner was all about. It was a power grab for left wing political control-and let us not ever try to camouflage this. One has only to look at the new system of regions and zones that was to be created in the new ATSIC. They were out of kilter with every principle that the Australian Labor Party has ever stood for and has ever put forward in this place and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government went to a referendum earlier this year on one vote one value. There is nothing like that, of course, for Aboriginals. The discrepancies in the size and control and the vote rigging that would have taken place had ATSIC proceeded in the form in which it was put forward would have meant that Mr Hand and his left wing union mates had total control of $800m that was to be pushed by the Labor Government off the Budget out to a statutory authority and controlled in a very different manner. So it would not have mattered whether Australia had a right wing Hawke Labor government or whether we subsequently had a Liberal-National Party government in its place; Hand was out to ensure that that $800m to $1,000m was pushed off the Budget and out to totally independent control. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should read the various submissions that were made since last December, when Mr Hand first put up a study document called Foundations for the Future. Two options came forward in the early part of the year. In May the Minister decided he had to get rid of the alternative Aboriginal voice that was emerging through the Aboriginal Development Commission and he sacked eight proper Aboriginal leaders around Australia and put in eight cronies that he could totally control. To take it one step further, in June at the Burunga festival near Katherine in the Northern Territory the Prime Minister had a ring put in his nose, he was led around the circus ring and the promise of a treaty was made. A week later at the ADC meeting one of Mr Hand's new appointees on the ADC, Pat Dodson, was appointed by Perkins, another new Hand ADC commissioner, to control the distribution of $500,000 for the purpose of negotiating a new treaty with Aboriginal people. What has happened to that treaty? All we know is that about $200,000 of that money seems to have filtered away and disappeared through Tranby College, through a couple of community meetings. Where is the rest of it? Where is the commitment to Aboriginal people around Australia? What is standing in line? It is only the lefties that have gained any advantage at this particular time. There was a total sham of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators take the time to read a series of questions that I put on notice through the other Senate Estimates committees they will see that this new ATSIC was being forced through by a Labor government, or by a couple of Ministers. Obviously Gerry Hand and Bob Hawke had walked into Cabinet and said, `Trust us. We've got the goods; we'll do it'. Senator Reynolds, Senator Walsh, Senator Richardson and all of the other Ministers sat back and said, `Yes, we trust you, Gerry; we trust you, Bob'. What has come out in the answers to all of those other questions is that even the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Local Government and so many other government departments were not aware of the fundamental principles of ATSIC and how things were going to change. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that in recent days the Prime Minister has said that the Government is rethinking its position. It is rethinking its position only because the voice of genuine Aboriginal people out there in outback Australia is at last being heard, and not in a paternalistic way. Gerry Hand may have walked around and consulted with more people than any government has ever done before, but he spoke at them; he did not speak with them. He did not listen for replies; he did not wait for the alternative view. He sacked the people who gave him alternative views. That was probably the most crucial thing. Of course, this Hawke Labor Government does not consult with the other interested parties, such as the State and Territory governments and the industry groups that would be affected by such a major proposal involving the shifting of $800m to $1,000m off Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also very pleased to note that in very recent days alternative land councils in regions in the Northern Territory are seeking to break away from those stacked groups that are already there in the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. Maybe the one good thing the Hawke Labor Government has done is to make sure that Imparja Television got mobile through Alice Springs, because the Aboriginal community throughout Australia is now seeing what this Government is up to. It is now seeing the debate between traditional and urban Aborigines, the debate between authority and autonomy, and the debate between proper decisions and the gangs of four, whether they are in the Minister's office, the ADC, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> These gangs of four lefties seem to be in place everywhere. The suspicious networks that Hand and Perkins have set up have now meant that Aboriginal people themselves are demanding alternative breakaway land councils. The Aboriginal Cultural Foundation is singing out on the traditional issues of northern Australia, and community government, which is local government by Aboriginal people closest to the people, is emerging. The South Australian Government, the Northern Territory Government, the Queensland Government and hopefully the Western Australian Government will shortly address this matter. Community government is the way to go-not these fancy, biased proposals of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading debate on the Appropriation Bills has been very protracted. The debate was preceded by very detailed questioning of each department's appropriations in the hearings of the six Senate Estimates committees. This second reading debate will no doubt be followed by further detailed consideration when we are in the Committee of the Whole. In my remarks tonight I want to spend much of my time on the subject of the Government's policy towards and its administration of Aboriginal affairs. I fully acknowledge the magnificent speech made by Senator Tambling tonight. The work that he has done in this area, in particular during Estimates committee hearings over recent weeks, has been of enormous benefit to this Parliament because of the very great importance of the matters that primarily he has raised, with the support of many other people, including Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell, who are members of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I was pleased to join Senator Tambling in the discussion of these matters by Senate Estimates Committee E.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pay tribute to Senator Tambling for the work that he has done in this area. The work was not done just to make a political point; indeed, the contrary was the case. What we are really talking about is how best we as a nation can further the progress and development of a section of our community which we all-whether we are Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal-regard, accept and know is amongst the least privileged and the most deprived. The sad thing that has been happening in Australia over many years, particularly under the policies and administration of this Government, has been that Aboriginal communities have suffered very grievously. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to direct most of my remarks tonight to this area. It was the major issue considered by Senate Estimates Committee E, of which I was a member. That Estimates Committee also considered the appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and the Department of Administrative Services. I will reserve most of my comments on these departments to the committee stage. However, I wish to touch on some aspects of these departments in tonight's debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to refer briefly to the economic environment in which this debate is occurring. The current state of the Australian economy is one of grave concern to us all-or it certainly should be. However, the more that I hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other senior Ministers pontificating, the more I doubt whether they appreciate this quite fundamental point. To listen to Ministers Hawke and Keating and Senators Button and Walsh, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Australian economy was on the right course. Nothing could be further from the truth. The basic parameters around which the Budget was framed just three months ago are now fatally flawed. I refer in particular to Australia's inflation rate, the balance of payments deficit and the level of interest rates. These are, of course, all interrelated. The Budget forecast for inflation in 1988-89 was about 5 1/2 per cent for the year as a whole, and there was a projection of an annual rate of 4 1/2 per cent by the June 1989 quarter. In fact, on the latest figures, inflation is running at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent. It is more likely to rise than to fall in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way that the Budget Papers forecasts will be met. They will be exceeded, in my view, by at least 2 per cent. In other words, inflation in 1988-89 will be two-fifths higher than forecast. Similarly, with regard to the balance of payments deficit on the current account, the Budget forecast a current account deficit of $9.5 billion this year. Already, after only four months, the deficit is $5.4 billion-an average monthly deficit over those four months of $1.35 billion. For the full year figure to come out at the forecast of $9.5 billion, the monthly deficit over the remaining eight months would have to average almost one-third of that figure-$510m per month. Even allowing for seasonal and other factors, that figure is impossible to achieve. The current 1988-89 current account deficit will exceed the Budget forecast by at least $2 billion. On this basis it will be as large as it was in 1987-88, and quite possibly a deal larger. </PARA>
<PARA> On any objective assessment, the Australian dollar is overpriced. In fact, its value is rising rather than falling. There are several reasons for this seemingly perverse performance. One, of course, is the weakness of the United States dollar; but the overriding reason is the level of interest rates in Australia. The Government has deliberately engineered a large rise in rates in recent months. It sees this as one means of cooling demand in the economy. Also, the authorities fear a cost-price induced increase in inflation if they let the Australian dollar fall back to a level more in line with our underlying competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy is fraught with danger and is totally inequitable. It hits every home buyer in the country, particularly young couples striving to buy their own homes. Repayments on an average home loan have gone up astronomically under this Government, by 70 per cent and more in many instances. Higher interest rates also hit productive enterprises and investment, because they increase costs. This will have a damaging effect on the structure of the economy and on the rate of inflation. The effect on inflation could well be more severe than would be the case if interest rates were lower, thereby allowing the Australian dollar to fall. At the same time, of course, exporters would not be disadvantaged-some very grievously-as they are at the moment with the current high level of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing high interest rate monetary policy is being imposed at a time when the overall economy is not as strong as the Government would have us believe. Today's national accounts figures for the September quarter clearly indicate that. A rise of only 0.3 per cent in real gross domestic product in the September quarter and a fall of 3.2 per cent in private fixed investment in equipment are hardly signs of a booming economy. The latest retail sales figures released yesterday support this view. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say any more about the economy at this stage, other than to say that the Government's ill-conceived economic policy is simply a product of the Government's failure to take the tough economic decisions to get this economy going and growing and internationally competitive. On those grounds, we are going backwards and our actual productivity is declining. In the last year it declined by approximately 1.4 per cent in absolute terms. Against the rest of the world, of course, our productivity is down much more than that. Until the Government reduces its own avaricious demands on goods and services, and therefore on taxpayers, who now face a crippling taxation burden; until it takes measures to increase our productivity by tackling the real problems of an inflexible wages policy and other labour market rigidities, gross inefficiencies on the waterfront, and the freeing up to greater competition and privatisation of government owned businesses, the Australian economy will continue to limp along while the living standards of all Australians continue to decline especially in comparison with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now say something about two other issues which I believe are of great concern in their very different ways. These two issues, together with that of Aboriginal affairs, on which I will conclude my remarks, although different, sum up very cogently one of the basic weaknesses of this Government. That weakness is a total inability to develop and administer a coherent set of priorities geared to the real needs of this nation as we approach the end of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the two matters to which I refer is the Government's proposals to introduce a new War Crimes Act. During the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee E I was appalled to find an apparent lack of appreciation amongst departmental officials of the sensitivity of this issue and of its scope to cause massive division within the Australian community. I was also appalled at the lack of concern shown by both the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, and departmental officials. I am concerned that there is a dangerous cloak being thrown over the activities of the special investigator, Mr Greenwood. Denials are being made that people have been interrogated, but I actually know people who know people who have been interrogated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the Government come clean about just what is going on. The number of people being investigated seems to vary day by day. We were told in the Senate Estimates Committee that the figure was now 414. I have seen reports in recent days that the investigator says it is about 550. No-one is prepared to tell us when the special investigator will complete his investigations, whom he is talking with or what arrangements he may be making with other countries. Instead, the office of the special investigator was not even represented at the Estimates hearings. Many grave doubts are increasingly being held by an increasing number of people in the community about these war crimes proposals. It is essential that the Government come clean about all the details. Instead, it spends a very large amount of taxpayers' money on the preliminary investigations, while average Australians grow poorer daily because of the inept management and policies of this Government-a government incapable of setting priorities in accordance with the needs of this nation and its people, a government still hell-bent on financial profligacy and socialist directions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I want to raise briefly concerns the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). Again, the treatment the Government is according the NCSC is a classic example of just how out of touch this arrogant, tired Government is with the real needs of Australia. The NCSC is our corporate watchdog. It was established by the Fraser Government in the late 1970s as the linchpin of the cooperative arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States to promote commercial certainty, to reduce business costs, to improve efficiency and to maintain investors' confidence in our securities markets. That is an enormous task. It is also enormously important, particularly at the moment. The NCSC has a huge workload on its hands, as it has had for the past year or so. It has looked at such matters as the Bond group takeover of the Bell Group Ltd, the IEL takeover of Woolworths Ltd and the share dealings by the Bell Group and Elders in relation to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. It is now conducting inquiries into Rothwells Ltd, into that scandalous situation concerning the whole of the Western Australian Government now known, and appropriately so, as Western Australia Inc. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or Western Australia Red Ink, as Senator Michael so rightly says. It is a scandal which has involved taxpayers' money by the squillions. There is no doubt that, as those investigations go ahead, the corruption that will be found to exist in Western Australia will make the situation in other parts of Australia look like chickenfeed. The NCSC is also conducting inquiries into Ariadne-again a very complex inquiry-yet it is starved of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year-in 1988-89-there is a budgeted fall of 4 per cent in real terms in the amount of funds available to the NCSC. The Executive Director of the NCSC, Mr Ray Schoer, when I asked him at the Estimates hearings about the Commission's resources compared with those a year earlier, said that it was having difficulty then in keeping up with the range of things it was supposed to be doing, and that its workload had increased massively since. He said in response that the situation `has deteriorated, the situation is worse'. That is an extraordinary sense of priorities by this Government. Why is it acting in this way in relation to the NCSC? I believe it is acting in this way to cause the denigration of the NCSC in a desperate and quite unscrupulous bid to win support for its huge package of centralist, socialist proposals to establish a new raft of regulatory arrangements for the management and regulation of securities industries in Australia, where the real power would reside in bureaucratic hands in Canberra. There has been a complete lack of consultation between the Government and industry on this matter. Fortunately the Senate has had the good sense to set up, along with the House of Representatives, a joint select committee to examine this huge package of proposals, the largest ever seen in Australia's legislative history. The Senate is going to have a very important role indeed in the examination of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to speak about the Hawke Government's policy towards, and its administration of, Aboriginal affairs in this country. I acknowledge at the outset that this is not an area in which I have been closely involved in the past. Members of parliament cannot get across each and every area of involvement by the Federal Government. My attention has tended in the past to be focused on matters other than Aboriginal affairs. My present interest and involvement in Aboriginal affairs has been occasioned by my membership of Estimates Committee E. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crichton-Browne; I acknowledge that. It has the responsibility for exercising and examining the appropriations for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). As I said at the outset of my remarks, I pay very high tribute to the work of Senator Tambling on Estimates Committee E, and to the work of other senators on my side of politics who have been involved over many years in the examination of, and policy towards, Aboriginal affairs. In particular I pay tribute to Senator Peter Baume and Senator Fred Chaney, both of whom have been Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs in coalition governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am dismayed at what was revealed at the recent hearings of the Estimates Committee. Since then I have read more widely. Had I done so earlier, perhaps I would simply have been dismayed earlier, because the policy direction and the administration of Aboriginal affairs have been in an appalling state for years under this Government. Of even greater concern, the situation has deteriorated progressively and rapidly over those years. I do not place all the blame on the shoulders of the present Government. The Fraser Government was not blameless. Aboriginal affairs is an extraordinarily difficult area to administer and in which to find a proper basis for policy direction. The Fraser Government did not get it totally right, nor, of course, did the Whitlam Government. Indeed, that Government in many ways put us on the fatal path on which the Hawke Government has built. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember in the second half of the 1970s having to examine, along with Senator Michael Baume, the disasters that occurred in the Aboriginal affairs area under the administration of the Whitlam Government. People will remember such things as the turtle farms that never had a chance of economic viability, the promises that were made to the Aboriginal people that were broken before the ink was dry, and so on. Many aspects of the present situation concern and dismay me. They fall into two categories: firstly, the policy framework, and, secondly, the administration of that framework. The two are interrelated, but I will try to separate them for the purposes of exposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy framework is obviously wrong. One can say that categorically by just looking at the facts. In the five years since the Hawke Government came to office it has allocated $3.3 billion to Aboriginal affairs. That is a huge amount of money by any standards. Its enormity is even more apparent when one considers the relatively small size of the Aboriginal population in Australia. I am not certain what the claimed Aboriginal population in Australia is, but on rough figures that outlay of $3.3 billion would have to constitute for every Aboriginal man, woman and child a minimum of about $10,000 over that period. Different people have different views about the result but I do not know of anyone in the community who would say that the Aboriginal people are in a better state than they were at the start of this Government's administration. In that sense I draw support from the answer given by the Aboriginal Development Commission to a question put on notice by Senator Tambling in Senate Estimates Committee E. When it was asked about the disparity in the economic status of Aboriginals and other Australians, the Aboriginal Development Commission responded in writing. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>ADC concerns that the disparity between the economic status of Aboriginals and other Australians is continuing to widen is supported by the fact that:-</PARA>
<PARA> National average weekly male earnings (NAWMEs) of the two groups has continued to widen marginally. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal NAWMEs includes a higher element of dependency on unemployment benefits and CDEP payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of unemployment among Aboriginals decreases more slowly than for other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In certain areas unemployment among Aboriginals is increasing because of:</PARA>
<PARA> continuing decline in employment opportunities as a result of mechanisation and structural changes in primary industry</PARA>
<PARA> the inadequacy of education and training resulting in a higher percentage of Aboriginals being dependent in lower paid, less-skilled or unskilled employment</PARA>
<PARA> employment opportunities for Aboriginals being fewer because of this and the limited employment available in areas, particularly rural, where most Aboriginals live. </PARA>
<PARA> ADC experience-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Commission is right at the grassroots of the Aboriginal communities in this country-</PARA>
<PARA>is that Aboriginals need greater access to finance, professional assistance, and commercial guidance. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are some answers from the ADC as to what is happening as a result of the policies of this Government. Recently, a study was completed by Professor Malcolm Treadgold, who is the professor of economics at the University of New England. After a very detailed study of the period from 1976 to 1986 he produced a report which came to certain conclusions. In a radio interview Professor Treadgold said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . hundreds of millions of dollars which have been poured into promoting Aboriginal welfare and employment have not improved their relative economic position in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>He gave the reasons for that but I will not go into all the details, other than to reiterate the basic message that, despite the huge amount of funding that has gone into Aboriginal affairs over the last five years under this Government, the position of Aborigines within the Australian society has deteriorated rather than improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The same is so in relation to health. Just recently a study was concluded by the Australian Institute of Health and included in its biennial report. It found that the mortality rate of young and middle-aged Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has improved only marginally in 10 years and is now comparable with mortality rates in places such as Haiti, Ghana and India. The study said that the mortality rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is double the national average. It also said that all these figures were of particular importance because Aboriginal health programs had been fragmented and poorly coordinated. That is a criticism that must be levelled fairly and squarely at the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The direction of policy has been wrong in the whole area of Aboriginal affairs. If the Government gets its way and abolishes the existing Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission and puts in their place a huge new bureaucratic structure known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), that wrong direction will be compounded. This would mean the creation of something like 58 to 60 new regional councils, and the administration problems would be absolutely horrendous. At the same time, though, the new structure removes some checks and balances in the administrative procedures and gives the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) a veto over the activities of the Commission in a way which would completely remove the need and the basic desirability of Aboriginal people being responsible for their own decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there were opposing views to the creation of this new monstrosity virtually all the directors and the commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission were sacked by the present Minister in May, and the reason they were sacked was that they dared to express views about ATSIC that were contrary to those of this Government. In the construction of the ATSIC proposals there has been a complete lack of consultation between the Government and the Aboriginal communities around Australia; so the attempt to establish this Commission has been lamentable. The worst thing about the proposal is that it divides Australia. The Government believes that having this new Commission is good because it represents the first major attempt in our history to provide a formal framework through which Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders can influence government decisions which affect them and their interests. If and when the Bill becomes law, it will mean one thing above all others. Professor Colin Howard, Professor of Law at Melbourne University, said that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>aims to set up an organisation closely resembling a miniparliament for the sole use and advantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. What this will mean is that a section of the Australian population will have been singled out by reference to race for separate representation based on a separate voting roll. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues that the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>if it becomes law, will have revealed us as being as racist as anyone else. We should not be in the business of deliberately creating a sub-nation with a sub-parliament with enormous powers to claim land and other property as its own. Whatever the motives, this is a recipe for racial disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly agree with the view of Professor Howard on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission has been very well explained and set out tonight by Senator Tambling. I will not go over his words other than to repeat that the waste and inefficiencies that have been shown up in the administration of this Department are quite scandalous. I believe that Charles Perkins was sacked as a scapegoat for the preceding and present Ministers of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding and Mr Hand. They have a great deal to answer for to the Australian community. That was made clear in part by a letter forwarded last year to Mr Hand, which was not properly replied to, from the President of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association (ACOA). I seek leave to incorporate that letter and the reply from the Minister in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letters read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hand,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you to express ACOA's concern about aspects of the administration of your Department. This concern derives from formal resolutions of meetings as well as from individual representations from members. When these are considered in the light of correspondence and meetings between ACOA and Departmental management, their seriousness is compounded. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold issue of consultation with ACOA has, I think, been resolved with the Secretary's undertaking to be responsible for such consultation at the National level. (It is inappropriate for the Secretary to consult local workplace representatives on other than purely local matters.) I have no current complaint about the adequacy of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, fundamental issues which I believe require Ministerial attention. This need is emphasised by the projected over-run on the salaries vote this year, by the new APS structure and associated changes described in the 2nd Tier Wages agreement, and by the impending establishment of an Australian Aboriginal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue from which most others derive, as I see it, is that of recruitment and staffing practices. I have no hesitation in asserting that people have been recruited to the staff of the Department by a number of processes not provided for even in the special provisions established to facilitate entry of Aboriginal personnel. Further, my understanding is that some people so recruited have no unique position number, and some have no ASL cover. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from my unsuccessful attempts to quantify this problem that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) malpractices are not regularly disclosed by other officers of the Department either because they themselves may be compromised or through fear of reprisals, or because they do not wish to appear to be, or be identified as, racist, or as betrayers of the Aboriginal cause. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) the existence of such malpractices is widely, if not universally, acknowledged within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) these practices have led to an alarming loss of morale which is claimed by some officers to lead to conspicuous inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) some people recruited by unconventional means are not competent to perform the duties they have allegedly been recruited to perform. Some do not even attend work on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) many people recruited to clerical assistant or basegrade clerical jobs are given positions where they are acting in higher duties in the clerical administrative structure without competitive assessment of their suitability and without training to provide the requisite skills. It is claimed that some are even acting on a partial-performance basis whilst being paid for full performance. Along with most other officers acting on higher duties in the APS, these people will become substantive at the level at which they are acting when the 2nd Tier Wage agreement is ratified in the near future by the Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) there is a widespread desire within the Department to have the recruitment/promotion/higher duties situation cleaned up and conducted on a proper basis. The current situation brings the Department and its officers into disrepute with the communities it is supposed to serve efficiently and effectively. The very many competent, hard working and dedicated officers, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, who care about the quality of service provided by the Department are having their efforts and their career opportunities undermined while these unconventional practices continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation seems to me to require thorough internal but independent investigation before loyalties are stretched too far and a wider more public investigation becomes necessary. Tensions have been raised a significant amount by the current requirement to find $1-$1.5 million dollars to be saved on the salaries bill by 30 June 1988. In this climate, the conduct of Aboriginal-only staff meetings is most unfortunate, and I trust you will put an end to this practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Also arising from the current discussion throughout the Department on the salaries over-run question, a number of cases of alleged misuse of the travelling allowance and other financial provisions have been reported to me. I am reluctant to specify these as I am not aware that they are of the same widespread and general nature as the recruitment/promotion/HDA situation, and hence the locations of my informants may be identifiable. There is genuine concern about reprisal action being taken against complainants. However, in general terms, there is concern about the use of accommodation paid for by the Department by people not entitled to it, the acquisition by the Department of one or more camper-trailers not available for general Departmental use, the provision of travelling expenses including TA to people not on necessary Departmental business, payment for consultants who have not delivered an identifiable service, and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I do not argue that the Department ought not make payments of the kind referred to, I most strongly do argue that such moneys should be separately identified in the Department's financial estimates and records and be processed in an open and proper manner. It is unacceptable to ask public servants to do their jobs in ways they know or believe to be wrong, and designed to mask the purpose for which public moneys have been spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of patronage is raised by some aspects of the matters raised in this letter. Whilst I recognise that is a very difficult question for any and every Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I must insist that it cannot be resolved by removal from the political arena, to be placed on the shoulders and the consciences of public servants. Some at least of those public servants have had enough. The practices of DAA must be brought into line with the requirements of legislation, regulations and other government directives and awards of the C&amp;A Commission. Where these are incompatible with the practical requirements of administering this difficult and sensitive portfolio, then special provision must be made by Government to resolve the problem. This already happens in some areas, such as recruitment, in which instance even these special provisions are not adhered to. The creation of an Australian Aboriginal Commission presents an opportunity to make a fresh start in respect of the fundamental issue of accountability. It also presents an opportunity for issues involved in the current crisis to get right out of hand, to the great detriment of the Aboriginal people. I look forward to an early opportunity to discuss this and related matters with you. </PARA>
<PARA> Should you wish to be briefed on the special provisions which apply to the recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people to the Public Service, I strongly recommend that you seek such a briefing from the Equal Employment Opportunity Unit in the Public Service Commission, the Director of which is Ms. Gail Radford. The unit is able to provide the most expert and authoritative advice available on this matter in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Please contact me if you wish to discuss any matter with me, whether raised in this letter or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Ms Forward</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 6 November, which makes a number of serious and disturbing allegations about my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed your letter with the Secretary of the Department. He rejects the allegations. He points out, however, that, where evidence of what you have alleged can be provided, the matters will be thoroughly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the allegations go to matters of staff recruitment. I am advised that the Department's recruitment and other staff administration follows the procedures laid down in the Public Service Act and regulations. It follows, therefore, that any suggestion of patronage is out of order. </PARA>
<PARA> As for allegations of financial improprieties, I am told that my Department, along with all others, is regularly subject to audit, both internally and by the Auditor-General. The latter made his most recent inspection in February this year and his findings make no reference to matters of the kind mentioned in your letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Here again, however, any concrete evidence you may have will be most carefully examined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reflect upon and discuss some aspects of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which, very sadly, has been the matter of debate by Senator Tambling, Senator Short and now me. The great tragedy is that the real losers are the Aboriginal people-not those in the game of politics, the game of power, the game of manipulation. Sadly, this Department now reeks of politics. There is corruption and theft in the Department, and at the lowest levels there is even thuggery. One has only to look at a report by Mr Miller, the First Assistant Secretary, Corporate Services Division, to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in which he chose to comment upon the explanatory notes prepared by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). He makes the point that the ADC's explanatory notes were produced with little regard or sensitivity towards the government of the day. I would have thought that that was hardly the first priority of departmental officers preparing notes which are a fair reflection and an explanation of the expenditure of the Department. Mr Miller stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . with little regard for sensitivity towards the Government of the day and the DEET portfolio in which the Aboriginal affairs function is included. Whereas at times veiled remarks are made some other remarks are quite blatant. For example, a veiled remark appears on page 8, viz. Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged group in Australia in regard to housing and are often obliged to live in conditions which are a disgrace, particularly to a nation celebrating its bicentennial. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that that is not political; that is factual. Will officers now be criticised and condemned because they objectively state the facts? Commissioners were criticised because they clearly set out the position as they saw it and, I assume, as the vast majority of Australians see it. In regard to page 50 of the explanatory notes, Mr Miller noted:</PARA>
<PARA> Under `Performance 1987/88, for Land Acquisition', it appears from the performance indicators that the ADC did not spend all of the ADC funds of $1.2m provided last year. If that is the case then it is the first time we have been informed of Commonwealth underexpenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Miller noted:</PARA>
<PARA> This would be of particular concern as the Minister has been publicly critical of the WA Government for not spending all of its $10m last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Is the first brief of these departmental officers to make sure that the Minister is okay and that he can reinforce the criticisms he has made of State departments? Of course it is not. That really only sets the tone of the style of politics that is pervading the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I wish to refer to a letter by Brian Wyatt. If I recall, at one stage Brian Wyatt worked in the office of the Western Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Bridge. I am not certain where he is now. He wrote a letter to Mr Cedric Wyatt, who was then the Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia and who is now the Manager of the ADC. Mr Brian Wyatt wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Cedric</PARA>
<PARA> Attached for your comment are proposed amendments to the State Platform on Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Committee reports must be in by 8th July 1988 for the State Conference in September. </PARA>
<PARA> The next meeting is set for 5.30 on Tuesday 14th June 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Please advise of your availability. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the platform of the Australian Labor Party on Aboriginal affairs that the director of the Department in Western Australia, living high on the hog at taxpayers' expense, is asked to comment upon, and he is asked to be at the meeting at 5.30 in the afternoon to redraft the platform for the Labor Party. We wonder why the Department is crumbling around us. To start with, it is because of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to go through a couple of audit reports that I have referred to before. On the last occasion that I wrote to the Department and asked for a refund of the cost of obtaining the audits under the Freedom of Information Act the Department wrote back and said no, because it did not consider it to be in the public interest. One of the criteria on which members of parliament can seek documents and apply for a refund is that of public interest. The Department wrote back and said it was not in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. The audit shows corruption, theft, mismanagement and misappropriation, but it is not in the public interest for Australian taxpayers and Australian people to find out about it! Let me start with the Wangkatjunka community in Western Australia. The auditor's report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I report to members that I have audited the financial statements set out in pages two to seven in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The auditor referred to Mr Peter Ross, a project officer. I will come back shortly to that thug. In my view he is a thief yet he is still employed by the Department. The auditor stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It appears to have been the practice for your project officer, Mr Peter Ross, to book up personal motor expenses to the Association when on visits to Derby. Mr Ross claims that he arranged with your accounting agents, Marra Worra Worra . . . to deduct these expenses from his wages. However, this has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it has not been done because there has been no request for it to be done. That was Mr Ross's explanation when he was found with his fingers in the till. The auditor continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Association paid for two charter flights to and from Derby on 2/5/85 and 18/2/86 carrying Mr Ross. I have not been able to confirm that these expenditures were for the benefit of the Association and authorised by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The expense item `Store Purchases' includes various expenditures which do not relate to store purchases. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>Food items used by Mr Ross in entertaining visiting officials, personal items for Mr Ross which Mr Ross maintains should have been deducted from his wages by MWW but were not deducted. </PARA>
<PARA>They were not deducted because he did not ask for them to be deducted until he got caught with his fingers in the till. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Store purchase control was therefore impossible. This system is open to abuse. No control existed over store purchases or sales. The store enterprise showed a gross profit-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Cook to listen to this; this is the sort of private enterprise that he has referred to-</PARA>
<PARA>of only 8% on sales indicating that goods were:</PARA>
<PARA> paid for but not received. </PARA>
<PARA> stolen from the store. </PARA>
<PARA> not correctly paid for and the monies banked. </PARA>
<PARA>The auditor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I carried out a detailed analysis of the use of generator fuel and found that consumption varied between 146 litres/day to 551 litres/day-the latter being during the cool months of the year when airconditioning should have been at a minimum. The figures suggest that diesel fuel is being used for purposes other than generating electricity or fuel paid for is not being delivered to the generator tank. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about wages:</PARA>
<PARA>Wages records show that an amount of $180/wk was paid to Mr Alan Lawford as power-house operator during March, April and May. Mr Lawford was not residing at Wangkatjungka Community during these months. </PARA>
<PARA>He must have been a very clever operator. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>I am informed that the power-house was operated by the principal of the Christmas Creek primary school during that time and a cash payment of $80/week made to him. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows from the above comments that some consideration should be given to the process of authorising payments. I saw no indication of any formal process of authorising payments during 1985/86. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the significance of the above qualifications, I am not able to express an opinion on the financial reports of the Association for the year ended 30th June 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not selective quoting; that is in full and verbatim. Mr Ross, of course, would not like that report, but it happens to be an audited report-audited for the Wangkatjungka community and paid for and provided to the Wangkatjungka community. Let us go on a little further. </PARA>

<PARA>Concern has been expressed to us by various Aboriginal communities in relation to Mr Peter Ross Project Officer Junjuwah community. We have been informed that on a number of occasions he has accompanied mining companies on visits to other communities in an advisory capacity to the mining companies. He has also visited communities advising them not to have dealings with the Kimberley Land Council. We do not consider that these activities would fall within the normal duties and responsibilities of a Project Officer. It is our understanding that Project Officers are funded to assist communities in mechanical and practical day to day tasks. We are concerned that Mr Ross is using his position in Junjuwah community and that he is maintaining his position by unacceptable practices. We feel that the community may need assistance from your Department to deal with a situation which is detrimental to the interests of the community. The KLC is concerned that all Project Officer positions be reviewed regularly by DAA, and representatives of other Aboriginal organisations, particularly where reports of improper conduct have been alleged. </PARA>
<PARA> We require urgent action to investigate Mr Ross's conduct and interference in the affairs of other communities. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter, read in full, was written by Mr John Watson, Chairman of the Kimberley Land Council, to the then Minister, Clyde Holding. It is not I who makes the judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook is not satisfied with that; he provokes me further. I have a letter from Ben Oolararni to Clyde Holding, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Ben is the Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra-Fitzroy Crossing community. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>RE: PROJECT OFFICERS POSITION-WANGKATJUNGKA COMMUNITY-XMAS CK. </PARA>
<PARA>An extremely serious situation exists at Xmas Ck whereby the outgoing Project Officer from the Junjuwa Community, Fitzroy Crossing, has been lobbying intensively-with another Community's resources-for the Xmas Ck Job 503 9 in the course of this lobbying Aboriginal organisations and resources personnel have been maligned and slandered. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what is being said about Mr Ross. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In the best interests of community development, we are hopeful that all the applicants for this job will be given an equal chance to present themselves to the Community so that an informed decision can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peter Ross has been telling Wangkatjungka people that he already has the job-seriously jeopardising people's sense of power in the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> His Junjuwa job has been neglected while this lobbying has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious discrepancies occurred at previous Junjuwa elections whereby young children were rounded up and encouraged to vote for Mr Ross' candidate. Rifles and cars were used to curry favour with key people. </PARA>
<PARA>I assume that he is referring to rifles and cars as gifts and not as sharp points aimed in their direction. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> At one night meeting called by Mr Ross, it appears that an attempt was made to install a new Community Chairman without many key Community members being present-including the existing Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The feeling in Fitzroy Crossing is that the Community has been divided up, confused and exploited for this individual's personal gain. </PARA>
<PARA> It also appears Mr Ross is associated with a Western Australian company called Can Aussie which offers a consultancy service for mining companies. Old men are taken up in planes and asked to sign releases for mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious errors have been made using this method. Kim Akerman or Mr Peter Bindon of the Museum of Western Australia can be contacted for details. </PARA>
<PARA> John Clark-Liaison Officer, Department of Mines, can be contacted for confirmation of his mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA>This is Mr Ross, presumably. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Community morale is very low at present. Please give this matter your urgent consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ross has been waging a concerted and highly public campaign to thrust himself in the community in recent times, in the course of which I have borne the brunt of his criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this campaign, I would not be surprised if Mr Ross makes a direct approach to the Minister as he has threatened to do and has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I have complete confidence that my past work has been in the support of Community aspirations, and in regards to Ngaratjadu, there is a wealth of documentary evidence showing the Community's integrity is establishing the outstation. </PARA>

That letter was from the Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra community to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I am not privy to the correspondence, of course. I have no knowledge that the Minister ever bothered to write back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk for a moment about two or three communities. I am so sorry I have so little time, because there is so much to be said about the incompetence and dishonesty that have taken place in some of these communities, to the detriment of the Aboriginal communities themselves. We can look at Balgo Hills as an example. That is a community in the north-west of Western Australia where the nurses have been pulled out because they fear for their lives. They are flown to the community on a daily basis at great expense to the taxpayers. I understand that last week the white administration was also pulled out. The auditor says:</PARA>
<PARA>The internal controls over the cash float system were not adequate to ensure that all transactions were correctly recorded or accounted for. This resulted in discrepancies between the Bulk Cash figures and amounts actually paid in wages. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Grant expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>Various payments made from the CM &amp; S Account were not legitimate charges against that account. This aspect was noted during an inspection by DAA staff and was the subject of a letter to the Balgo Community dated 13 April 1987, pointing out particular discrepancies, which were noted during the course of the Audit. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of these payments were of a minor nature, but it was considered that the payment of audit fees of $2,500 from the CM &amp; S Account, which pertained to the General Account was excessive and this amount was adjusted in the final accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Road Grading amounting to $13,870 was charged against Casual Labour. This amount was transferred from Casual Labour to Road Grading. </PARA>
<PARA>And so the audit report goes on. It shows us, in the income and expenditure statement for the year ending 30 June 1987, that there is outstanding $105,509 unexpended from 1983-84 grants. The community is still being given grants and has not spent its 1983-84 grant. The 1984-85 grant was also unexpended in 1986, and that amounted to $69,534. If we go to the profit and loss appropriation account of 30 June 1987, under `Less Unexpended Grants' we will see that the 1984-85 community development employment program (CDEP) grant was unexpended by $148,634. The 1985-86 CDEP grant was unexpended. The 1986-87 CDEP grant was unexpended. The 1983-84 CM and S grant was unexpended. The 1986-87 CM and S grant was unexpended. The 1985-86 housing grant was unexpended. That totalled slightly less than $1m. I take it that there was some expenditure. My guess is that it was improper expenditure against matters which should not have been included. So it is still shown as unexpended. In 1985-86, for instance, the Aboriginal Development Commission pensioner unit grant of $70,000 was unexpended. I assume that the $70,000 was given for the pensioners in 1985 because it was needed, yet it is still shown as unexpended as at 30 June 1987. Under `Grants Income', in the note which forms part of the account, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Grant monies received whether for recurrent expenditure or capital works, are deemed a normal and continuing item of revenue attributable to the ordinary operations of Balgo Hills Aboriginal Community, although the amounts received may vary from year to year. </PARA>
<PARA>We find under `Note 4-Community Loans':</PARA>
<PARA>The loans are interest free and have no fixed terms of repayment. </PARA>
<PARA>It says that currently $13,000 is still outstanding. I assume that that is just $13,000 worth of taxpayers' money or chuck-in money that has been given away by somebody in the community. We are told under `Notes to and Forming Part of the Account (Continued)':</PARA>
<PARA>The internal controls over the cash float systems have not been completely adequate to ensure that all transactions have been correctly recorded and accounted for, final result being a cash deficiency loss of $454 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is Balgo Hills in brief. As one goes through all these reports, one finds exactly the same situation. Just for the record, for Senator Cook, between November 1986 and March of 1987 at Wangkatjungka $7,355 was drawn by Peter Ross and paid to Peter Ross as a loan, to my knowledge without authority. As at 30 June there had been a total repayment of $800. Further cheques were drawn by the same Peter Ross, amounting to $12,192. It is very hard to determine what happened to that money. One cheque was clearly made out to himself in the amount of $750. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not making an allegation; I am stating what the auditor says. If Senator Cook does not like it, he can choke on his own microphone. I refer to the report of Hendry, Rae and Court, the auditors for the Oombulgurri Association. It is an interesting association because its books went missing at the same time as did the bookkeeper. I was told at an Estimates committee two years ago that the Commonwealth police had been called in and were investigating him. I have since been told that the Department paid him $35,000 or thereabouts in some form of compensation. Almost every one of these organisations, sadly, is tainted by failings. What did the auditors say about the Oombulgurri people? They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the first few months of the year ended 30 June 1987 the internal controls over cash payments were not sufficient to ensure that all payments were made for bona fide community purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> A list of payments made for which we could find no supporting documentation for whatsoever is contained in Note 7. </PARA>
<PARA>Cash float</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The internal controls surrounding the cash float system were not adequate to ensure that all outgoings could be accounted for or that transactions were correctly recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> Because no daily reconciliations were performed we were unable to quantify the financial effect of the weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Wages</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Due to the cash control weaknesses noted above, we were unable to accurately reconcile wages paid with the wage records. Scrutiny of selected wage records revealed that there was an overpayment of wages during the period, however, it was impractical for us to ascertain the financial extent thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>That reminds me that at Wangkatjungka the books showed countless occasions when wages were overpaid. Those wages were paid to the Aboriginal community by Mr Ross in cash. Those poor Aboriginal people do not know what the books say; they know what they get in their hot little hands. So let Senator Cook tell me the difference between the overpayment and the cash they received. It is not unreasonable to assume it was misappropriated somewhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I have had complaints to me from people in Fitzroy Crossing that they have been threatened. I had one case of an Aboriginal man who claimed that his pension cheque had been stolen and he had subsequently found it cashed. In whose possession was it? There is no prize for guessing. Let me talk about the Kalumburu Aboriginal Corporation. It put the creditors in Wyndham in such a situation that they were almost bankrupt because it could not pay its bills. But that did not stop the Department of Aboriginal Affairs investigating whether it was appropriate that it buy the Corporation an aeroplane to fly back and forward with goods it could not afford to buy. Let us deal with the Corporation's accounts for a moment. The report on Kalumburu states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Cash Payments</PARA>
<PARA>The internal controls surrounding cash payments and the ordering of goods were not adequate to ensure that the goods were for bona fide community purposes. In addition, several instances of suppliers being paid twice were found. However, it was not possible to determine the financial effect thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>Cash Receipts</PARA>
<PARA>Cash receipts were not adequately recorded and, as a result, we were unable to properly ascertain the true reason for the money being received in many instances. </PARA>
<PARA>Cash Float</PARA>
<PARA>The internal controls surrounding the cash float system were not adequate to ensure at all outgoings could be accounted for or that transactions were correctly recorded. </PARA>

<PARA>Wages</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the cash control weaknesses noted above, we were unable to accurately reconcile wages paid with the wage records. Scrutiny of selected wage source records suggested that there was an overpayment of wages during the period. However, it was impractical for us to ascertain the financial extent thereof. </PARA>
<PARA>There are pages of the report but time prevents me from going through them. In the brief time left to me I wish to touch on one other document. It is a document signed by Ross McLarty, who at that time was Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra Community, and written to the Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He complained about a number of matters. He complained first-I do not know whether it was legitimate or not-about the conduct and the actions of a Victor Hunter, the senior project officer in Derby. He complained:</PARA>
<PARA>Also Marra Worra Worra feels it is being ignored by Victor Hunter because of their protests some time ago at the fact that he picked up a hitch hiker and took him to Wangkatjungka Community and told them they had to employ him as a mechanic, and the fact that the hitch hiker (Joel Slater) then absconded from Wangkatjungka with the community vehicle and over $5,000.00 in cash and it cost Wangkatjungka $2,000.00 to have him extradited from Sydney and to stand trial in Perth where he received 3 months jail and a $500.00 fine. No one knew anything about him and the day after he was caught by the police he had a ticket booked to go to America. He is a Canadian and was in Australia on a tourist visa. </PARA>
<PARA> Victor Hunter at the same time replaced Richard Scutt at Bayulu Community for 3 months, and since that time there has been nothing but trouble at Bayulu, and Richard Scutt has also drawn up his own contract which he has repeatedly asked the Chairman to sign. </PARA>
<PARA>This is really pathetic in the true sense of the word. In a pleading way the Chairman notes:</PARA>
<PARA>We also do not think we should have to pay the excess of $200.00 on the new bus we purchased that Victor Hunter drove up here at Christmas time and rolled over, as he has never told the Executive what happened he just arranged it all in Port Hedland and told us nothing, and we did not receive the bus until March. </PARA>
<PARA>What is important about that is that there seems to be a lack of discipline, control and input by the Department in relation to those sorts of matters. But the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' Cedric Wyatt wrote back-it is moving to read this-relating to the bus rolled over by the project officer in Derby:</PARA>
<PARA>The questions relating to the bus are I understand a private matter between yourselves and Mr Hunter and do not involve the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA>As regards the future funding of MWW I must register my serious concern after the discrepancies and inefficiencies pointed out by your auditor and which have apparently yet to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>It took that organisation to complain about some very serious matters to which the Department was very sensitive before the Department sent back a letter of abuse threatening it with a withdrawal of its funds because it had complained about one of the project officers. That is the problem with this Government and with the Department at present: there is no management, there is no efficiency, there is no accountability, there is no concern, there is no care-and least of all is their compassion for the Aboriginal community. They are pawns in this game of black politics. These poor Aboriginal people are used in the long term for the benefit of these project officers, in some cases, and of the community officers, and at the end of the day they are lined up and convinced, because they know no better, to vote for the Labor Party. I find it sad and depressing; but more than anything else I find it an indictment of this Government, which shows no care and no compassion. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the Eleventh Report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing,</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reaffirms the resolution of 2 December 1985 concerning the determination of the estimates of expenditure for the Senate to be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) requires the Minister for Finance to process the Senate Department's estimates as early as practicable to enable any differences between the Minister and the Committee to be resolved in accordance with the resolution; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expects that the resolution will be adhered to in determining those estimates in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>We have just heard, at the end of the second reading debate on this Bill, an example of the typical standover tactics employed by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who has told the Senate that he does not care what resolution is carried by this chamber, that he has no concern about what the wishes of this chamber of the Parliament are, that, as far as he is concerned, we can pass this motion over and over again and it will have no effect on him. I am not surprised that it will have no effect on him because he treats this Parliament with utter contempt. He treats the people of Australia with utter contempt. In the arrogant attitude he has expressed tonight he is simply maintaining a continuum of his normal style. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister asserted that only the Executive can make a request of the Governor-General to appropriate money. That is no great, flashing blast of brilliance. The Opposition is well aware of that. The Minister will certainly recognise that this motion is not making a request of the Governor-General. We are requiring the Minister to process the Department of the Senate's estimates as early as practicable to enable any differences between the Minister and the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing to be resolved in accordance with the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is good enough for there to be a resolution of 2 December concerning the determination of the estimates of expenditure for the Senate to be included in this Bill, then surely it is good enough for the Senate to require one of its members to do the Senate's bidding. I am very concerned indeed about the nature of the arrogant assertion the Minister has made in this place on this matter. I certainly encourage the Australian Democrats to examine very closely what the Minister has said. I believe that this is a far more serious matter than, clearly, the Minister considers it to be. I believe that the threat he made to this chamber at the end of the second reading debate and his expression of contempt of the wishes of this chamber, if they are so expressed, are not simply a matter, as I said earlier, of arrogance but an attempt to take a view of the role of the Senate which is unacceptable to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the Senate believes that he is not bound by any requirement by it is a matter that he can look to, but if he believes that he has the right to dismiss entirely, to reject without discussion or any intellectual input, the desires of the Senate, he is setting off on a course which will bring about a serious collision between the Executive and the Parliament. I do not believe that the Minister has thought through his position. Any Minister in this place who decides to ignore a requirement by this chamber is adopting the sort of confrontationist approach which we keep hearing criticised by members of the Australian Labor Party who claim to be the great supporters of consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am suggesting is that there are serious problems involved in the proposals about the parliamentary departments. Serious concerns have been expressed on our side-I think they are quite widespread-about the nature of the restructuring and so on. The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89 gives us an opportunity to discuss these concerns. It seems vitally important that differences between the Minister and the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, as evidenced in the eleventh report of the Committee, should be resolved in accordance with the resolution referred to in my motion. Is the Minister saying that these matters should not be resolved in accordance with that resolution? I think it is vital for us to know whether the Minister--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister interjects that decisions about expenditure will be made by the Executive. I wonder why we go to the trouble of meeting in this place to approve the Estimates if in fact the Minister is saying that he does not give a damn what the view of the Senate is. As far as he is concerned, the all-powerful Executive will do whatever it wants to do. Quite frankly, this crystallises the attitude that has developed in this Government, that is, that it does not matter what the Parliament and the people want; it is what the Executive wants that dominates everything. This attitude dramatises the fact that this Government is out of touch. We have already seen in by-election results the extent to which the people of Australia are now regarding this Government as being out of touch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government is going to persist with this view that it does not give a damn what the Parliament says or thinks and it will do what the Executive wants in all matters, I can only say that, to a degree, the Opposition welcomes the evidence of such arrogance because it will speed the end of that Executive. The Minister's approach here tonight is simply a reflection of the style of government we have learnt to expect from a government that is certainly out of touch, from a Prime Minister who seems to take more notice of his rich mates than what the Parliament has to say and from a Minister for Finance who seems to run out of friends not only in Australia but certainly within his own Party. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am asking the Minister to do, and all this motion is asking the Minister to do, is to process the Senate Department's estimates as early as practicable to enable any differences between the Minister and the Committee to be resolved. What is wrong with that? I ask the Minister to approach this matter in the spirit of consensus that he and his Party have continually suggested is the basic motive behind all of their political activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved on behalf of the Opposition by my colleague and cousin, Senator Michael Baume. I do so with not much fire. When we raised this issue a year or so ago on the occasion of the establishment of a select committee by the Senate, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) asserted that the Executive controlled expenditure and put forward the same argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put to the Committee that there has never been a resolution of the problem of the proper relationship between the Parliament and the Executive in relation to the funding of the Parliament. It seems that the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which led to the development of a basis for modern constitutional practice, failed to address this question. It did not resolve the question of the funding of parliament by the Executive. Australia, which has adopted the practice of the British Parliament, has not resolved this question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated that the Parliament in regard to its funding is subservient to the Executive. He has given us the reasons why. The Minister is correct in saying that only the Executive can initiate a message to the Governor-General. But to state that as a fact does not resolve the problem. The problem is one of what should be the proper relationship between the Parliament and the Executive for the funding of the Parliament. I have said before in this place that there are several possible scenarios. One could have an unreasonable parliament that demands from the Executive too much money. One could have an unreasonable Executive that sought to bring a difficult parliament to heel. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to avoid what could be potentially a constitutional crisis of the greatest magnitude, some mechanism needs to be established to resolve once and for all this question of how the Parliament should be funded by the Executive. The Minister has stated accurately the position at the present time. I suggest to the Committee that that is an unsatisfactory position. It is only because of the commonsense of all parties that there has not been a crisis in the 88 years since Federation. It seems to me an absolute certainty that at some time in the future the Executive and the Parliament will have a major confrontation on this matter. I therefore join my colleague Senator Michael Baume in saying that we need to find a cooperative solution. If the Minister says that this is not the time to look for such a solution, I urge him to say to us that he will try to take on board the need to examine this question and establish a way in which this can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have left, I want to raise one other matter which relates to the Executive and the Parliament. I intend to say very little during this debate on the appropriations legislation. I might take this opportunity to raise a matter that, to some extent, involves the Parliament. The provision of art works for the Parliament was raised during the consideration of the parliamentary departments. In fact, our Clerk, who is sitting in the advisers box, wrote a very important letter to the Committee indicating that the advice that had been given on this matter by the Parliament House Construction Authority was wrong in several quite important respects. Again, this is a problem created by executive practice. The Government withdrew some money from the budget provided for the furnishings of the new Parliament House. The Government made a judgment about the appropriate level of funding, and I do not question that decision. That was a decision for executive government. As a result of that funding withdrawal, the commissioning of art works had to be cut back and fewer art works were available for the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the very point I want to come to. The Executive, having decided that the art acquisition program should be cut back and that there should be fewer art works available, did not share in the consequences of that decision. It was awkward to obtain information because a couple of departments were involved. But during the examination of the estimates I asked for the list of art works that have been provided to Ministers and office holders. Of course, after they were provided with art works honourable senators were then allowed to choose two art works for their own offices. Some might say that that is more than we are entitled to, more than we deserve or more than we can usefully appreciate. But let us put that question to one side.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to him, Mr Chairman, not as the Chairman but as the occupant of the suite which received 25 art works. Many of the Ministers received 15 art works or more. I just want to make the point that the Executive, having made the decision to reduce the program-it may have been a perfectly correct decision-should have shared more obviously, visibly and publicly in the consequences of that decision. It did not do so. Not only that, but certain of the art works were not to be made available to private senators and members. If one goes to the offices of some of the most senior people in the Parliament, one sees not only works on the walls of their offices but some very nice ceramics in their offices as well. I can advise the Committee that private senators and members are not to be allowed to be issued with ceramics. No doubt people are concerned that, while they may be safe in the offices of Prime Ministers and leaders, they are not safe in the offices of private senators and members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that I am extremely grateful to a Canberra potter who, having heard of this plight on radio, came in and provided my office with two splendid pots. Of course I will provide my own art works to make up the number, and I am able to cope. But we have these two problems which involve the relationship between the Executive and the Parliament. Senator Michael Baume raised the first issue. I just remind the Minister that this is a continuing problem and sooner or later it will cause a constitutional crisis of the greatest magnitude. I suggest, in a spirit of amity really, that we establish a mechanism for trying to address and resolve this problem. I invite the Minister to consider that next time the Government cuts some program of provision for the Parliament the consequences might be shared equally. </PARA>

I was sorry to see that he did not take advantage of my point of order and continued in the second reading debate to address himself to the motion proposed by the Opposition in respect of the Appropriations (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89, the motion which is now before us. Had he ceased to make these comments it would have enabled Senator Michael Baume to move this motion and advance his arguments in support of it. I think that they were perfectly reasonable arguments, couched in conciliatory terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not one of us in this chamber who is not seized with the importance of cutting down on expenditure. As a member of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, I can assure the Minister that that is the fact. The Minister does not need assurance from me; presumably he has the assurance of the Government representatives on that Committee. They know as well as I do that we really carve the expenditure right down to the bone. In fact, extreme difficulty is likely to be experienced if a further adjustment is not made to the finances available for essential services to senators. Of course I cannot speak for members of the House of Representatives, because that is another area and it would not be appropriate or proper for me to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go into the correspondence that has presumably been the basis of this motion. As matter of fact, I did not know that this motion was to be moved, I must say. But, having read it, I am in favour of it and will vote for it. I hope that the Minister sees his way clear not to retract but somehow to smooth over the words that he has uttered tonight. That statement is constitutionally correct, as has been indicated, but whether or not it is constitutionally correct is beside the point. If we are committed to parliamentary democracy, surely the Minister for Finance, who holds the purse strings, must be the first to recognise that, and he must recognise it publicly by way of a statement to this chamber. Unless he does so, I am afraid we will be on a collision course with the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 October 1987:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How many ex-regular Defence personnel are there in the community who: (a) have at least six years regular Defence Force service; (b) are under the age of 35; and (c) have left the regular Defence Force within the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Would not such people be the most effective reinforcements for our regular Defence Force in the event of an emergency.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) What obligations do regular Defence Force personnel have to continue to serve in the reserves on completion of their regular Defence Force contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What incentives are given to them to join the Reserve Forces.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the present time some 5700 ex-regular Defence Force personnel would fit these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Such people would be a valuable source of reinforcements in a defence emergency. For this reason personnel completing their service in the regular forces are actively encouraged to join the Reserves even though they are under no obligation to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Like the Regular Forces, the Reserves are all volunteers and there are no specific incentives for ex-regular Defence Force members to join. The tax-free salary is an inducement to all the community to join the Reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Reliable, long term records of the proportion of ex-regular Defence Force personnel who join the Reserves on completion of regular service are not available.</PARA>
