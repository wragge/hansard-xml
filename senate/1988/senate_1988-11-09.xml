<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1986 and the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. The amendments contained in this Bill include measures to address the reports of the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee and to implement decisions provided for in the 1988/89 Budget. The Bill also contains a number of minor non-Budget measures. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is primarily aimed at giving effect to those major recommendations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee accepted by the Government and requiring legislative amendments to implement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Monitoring Committee was set up on 18 May 1987 to determine the extent to which the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 met the stated intentions of the Government at the time of its passage through Parliament. The Report of the Monitoring Committee was presented to the Government on 23 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the Government's initial response to the Report were set out in a response booklet sent to all Members and Senators in September. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted 28 of the Monitoring Committee's recommendations in full, four have been accepted in a modified form and another 20 are receiving further consideration. I will advise of the outcome in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Nine of the 32 accepted recommendations are considered to require immediate legislative amendment and are presented in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first initiative arises from a Committee recommendation which the Government accepted in full. The Bill provides for the introduction of an Extreme Disablement Adjustment (EDA) to assist those frail, aged veterans who are not adequately compensated by the present disability pension structure. These are veterans who are receiving the 100% general rate disability pension, are severely incapacitated by their war or defence-caused disabilities, have passed the normal retirement age and are not eligible for the intermediate or special rate of pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The EDA will be an addition to the maximum general rate pension received by the veteran and will be equal to 50% of that rate. It will mean an extra $42.15 a week for eligible veterans at current rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A major focus of the Monitoring Committee's Report was the eligibility criteria for intermediate and special rate pensions. The criteria for these higher rates of disability pension were changed by the Government in 1985 when it became clear that the outmoded terminology in the old Repatriation Act was enabling these pensions to be paid to veterans who had completed a full working life, often retiring on good superannuation payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Committee was critical of these criteria, arguing that the requirement for war-caused disabilities to be the sole cause of a veteran's inability to work was too harsh. In arguing this way, the Committee was perhaps overlooking the original intention of the intermediate and special rate pensions. This was to provide a higher level of pension to compensate those severely disabled veterans who could not work to support their families on their return from service. These pensions were never intended to be retirement pensions. That is why the Government took the steps it did in 1985 and why the changes to the eligibility criteria for these pensions were carried through to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Government does not agree with many of the views expressed by the Committee about those changes and in particular with the Committee's assessment of the intention behind the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could not, therefore, agree to recommendations made by the Committee for major changes to the eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has not rejected the Committee's recommendations on the intermediate and special rate provisions outright. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes major changes to the first of the eligibility criteria for such pensions and to procedural aspects of the scheme of the Act for assessing rates of pension. These changes will be of significant benefit to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the first of the criteria for eligibility for an intermediate or special rate disability pension is that the veteran be receiving or be eligible to receive a disability pension at 100% of the general rate. The Monitoring Committee had recommended abolition of this requirement altogether. This was not acceptable to the Government as the requirement for a high degree of incapacity has been an intrinsic part of the intermediate and special rate pensions since their introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government recognises the Committee's argument that a veteran can be unemployed and unemployable due to war or defence-caused incapacity when the incapacity is as low as that attracting a disability pension at 70% of the General Rate. The Bill will therefore provide for a reduction in the required degree of incapacity from 100% to 70%. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also criticised the `application day' provisions which were inserted in the legislation in 1987. The Government does not agree with many of these criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, as interpreted by the Federal Court, the day on which a veteran's eligibility for the special rate pension is to be determined has always been the day of his or her application. However a decision of that Court (McGuire) would have permitted decision makers to examine the right of a veteran to continue to receive pension at the special rate even though the eligibility criteria had been satisfied on the earlier application day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acted quickly by introducing amendments to overcome the effect of that decision. The effect of the 1987 amendments were twofold. The first was to confirm the application day as the relevant day on which to examine a claim. This prevented factors occurring after the application date, such as deterioration in non-war-caused disabilities or increasing age, from being taken into account as reasons why the veteran would have not been working at that later point in time. Such factors would have had a disentitling effect on the eligibility of any veteran for the higher rates of pension. The second was to ensure that, subject to certain exceptions, once granted on the basis of eligibility at the application day, a pension could not be taken away on a subsequent review. That is, the special rate pension was preserved for life. </PARA>
<PARA> A veteran who was not eligible for intermediate or special rate pension on the application day was precluded from being granted a pension prior to the 1987 amendments and continued to be so precluded after those amendments. Where a veteran became eligible for a higher rate of pension after the application day, the Act required the veteran to lodge a fresh application for increase in pension. Many veterans for a variety of reasons failed to lodge a fresh application. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure to follow this procedure has had an adverse effect in some cases and has meant the issue of a fixed `application day' assessment has continued to be a contentious one. Even recent decisions of the Federal Court indicate a misunderstanding of the scheme of the Act and the intention behind the application day provisions. Due to its contentious nature, I specifically requested that this issue be considered by the Monitoring Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the confusion and misunderstanding and the views of the Monitoring Committee, the Government has decided that the application day provisions will be amended. The new provisions would enable a veteran to qualify where he or she meets all the eligibility criteria at a date between the date of lodgment of the claim or application and the date of the decision of the Commission or any review body. While this will not have the effect of altering the existing eligibility criteria under the Act, it will mean that it will no longer be necessary to lodge a further claim or application for increase between the date of application and the date of determination of the claim when circumstances change during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee cited the example of a veteran who is employed at the time when his or her claim is lodged, who expects to and who subsequently does retire due to war-caused disabilities before the claim is determined. This veteran would not be required under the new scheme to lodge a fresh application upon retirement. Such a person will be entitled to special rate pension for life, provided of course that all the eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied in all respects at the date of his or her retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will allow decision makers to take into account significant variations in the degree of incapacity a veteran may suffer from his war-caused disabilities during the assessment period. At present, review bodies see themselves as restricted to looking at the veterans' situation at the time of the initial decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these amendments will allow a commonsense approach to be taken in the consideration of pension assessment applications and will have a significant beneficial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes a number of minor amendments arising out of recommendations made by the Monitoring Committee. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> clarification that the determination of the required degree of incapacity of at least 70% need not be made by a previous decision maker before the Commission, VRB or AAT proceed to consider eligibility for the intermediate or special rate of pension;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988 and the Privacy Bill 1988. I want first to say something about the tax file number proposal. As honourable senators are aware, that proposal has had a long gestation period. In 1986 the Senate debated a much wider proposal which the Government chose to call the Australia Card but which most members of the Australian community came to describe, after some time, as the ID card. Without dwelling upon the history of that proposal, it is a matter of record that it generated the most enormous public protest and was, incidentally, the trigger for the double dissolution which was granted to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by the Governor-General last year and which led to the Federal election of 11 July 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was in the course of examining the earlier Australia Card legislation that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, while expressing the gravest doubts about the Australia Card proposal, went on to say that in any case a much better alternative, a less intrusive and threatening alternative, would appear to be available in the form of what was then described as a high integrity tax file number. The Committee, of which I was not then a member, because I was not then in this place, so reported to the Senate and indicated that if appropriate proposals for a high integrity tax file number were to be brought forward by the Government, the members of the Committee from both sides of the chamber, at least, were unanimously favourably disposed towards such an alternative. It was some time after that, in fact this year, that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in his May economic statement, actually proposed the introduction of the enhanced tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the earlier debates in this place in October 1987, at the time when the Australia Card legislation was withdrawn, the newly reconstituted Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-you know, this, Madam Acting Deputy President, as we both have the honour to be members of it-was given on 8 October 1987 an extensive reference which arose out of the defeat of that Australia Card proposal. That reference ran to, I think, some 15 separate terms. I think it would be fair to summarise those terms by saying that, whilst they had nothing to do with the tax file number as such, because that particular proposal at that time was no more than a suggestion floating in the air, they had a certain relevance to the proposal as it finally emerged, because those terms of reference were very much concerned with the whole question of privacy in our society, and particularly privacy in so far as it concerns the amassing of large amounts of data of individuals by government databanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Treasurer's announcement in the May economic statement that the Government proposed to introduce an enhanced tax file number, the Senate gave its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs an additional two terms of reference which did indeed, on that occasion, relate specifically to the tax file number proposal. Those terms of reference were given to the Committee on 1 June this year, and it may be worth my very quickly quoting them. The first was to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the taxation file numbering scheme announced by the Treasurer in the May Economic Statement and, in particular, whether the scheme is likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and to eliminate fraud and abuses in the taxation and social security systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the possibility of that scheme developing into a de facto national identification card system with unacceptable impositions being made upon privacy and civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>As you are aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs began holding a series of public hearings on this matter on 11 July in Melbourne, and concluded those public hearings in Canberra on 26 September this year, having meanwhile visited a number of other capitals and, of course, held other non-public hearings. As honourable senators are aware, the Committee presented its report to the Senate recently, and I hope to come back to that towards the conclusion of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, a number of other things had been happening with the tax file number. In particular, on 22 June this year the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the then shadow Minister for Health, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and I met with the Commissioner of Taxation and his relevant Deputy Commissioner, Mr Carmody, here in Canberra for discussion of the proposal of the Treasurer. As a result, the Opposition issued a public statement which, while in no way accepting the tax file number proposal more generally, stated quite specifically that there were two aspects of the proposal as unveiled by the Treasurer in the May statement which the Opposition would not accept under any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the Treasurer's initial proposal was that citizens who were unwilling to quote their tax file numbers when opening or seeking to operate their existing bank accounts would have the penalty applied to them of having those bank accounts frozen. We made it clear that such a draconian measure by the Government-in passing one can only express one's astonishment that such a measure should ever have been contemplated-was totally unacceptable to the Opposition. Similarly, we also made it clear that the Treasurer's original proposal that people seeking to buy or sell shares or other securities would also be required, when placing orders for these purposes, to quote their tax file number to their stockbroker or whatever other agent was involved was totally unacceptable to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those two developments not merely because they form a necessary part of the recitation of the long drawn out history of the proposal we are discussing today but also because those reactions were to two specific and particularly offensive provisions of the Bill. In my own case, at any rate, they were also symptomatic of a more general reaction to the tax file number proposal. Having looked initially at the proposal, so far as the use of the tax file number was directed to the requirement for employees to quote the number when seeking employment or for that matter when persons were seeking an unemployment or equivalent form of benefit, which as far as the tax law is concerned is actually treated as wage and salary income, I had little real objection to the proposal in that narrow and confined form. I emphasise those last words `narrow and confined'. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, under the existing income tax law all wage and salary earners, even before the passage of this legislation, are asked to include their tax file number when each year or whenever they change employment they fill in their claim for the personal rebate. It is true that some taxpayers do not do that. As far as I am aware, the Commissioner does not pursue them for failing to do so, but most taxpayers comply with the request and provide to their employer, and through him to the Commissioner of Taxation, their tax file number. It seemed to me, and it still seems to me, that in that narrow respect the proposal contained in the tax file number Bill was little more than a formalisation of the situation which already exists. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns with the tax file number proposal, from the beginning, therefore, focused not on the proposed use of the file number in that way but on the other aspects of the Bill: in general terms, what one might call the proposals to link up individuals' tax file numbers with their bank accounts or other financial dealings, stockbrokers' records, if they happen to be in the category of people who deal with stockbrokers-I do not happen myself to be in that fortunate situation-or any other transactions which, so to speak, took the proposals into people's private lives or which could, at any rate, be seen as doing so. Let me repeat: it was that aspect of the tax file number proposal to which I therefore personally paid the greatest attention as we have moved along with its examination. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, that approach raises several questions. Firstly, should those other uses of the tax file number be approved at all? That is the threshold question. Should the use of the number go beyond that narrow use in respect of employment and social security, or a particular range of social security benefits? Secondly, if a wider range of usage were to be approved, should there be some means provided whereby those who have a deeply held and what one might almost call conscientious objection to these proposals could avoid them, provided, of course, that in doing so they did not avoid tax as well? It never has been any part of the Opposition's attitude towards this proposal that we should in any way look favourably upon the activities of-I was going to say tax avoiders, but the more correct term in this case is-tax evaders. Thirdly, and more generally, whatever the final shape of the tax file number Bill should prove to be-if it were to be enacted at all, that is to say-it was clearly of the greatest importance that, first, there should be safeguards against improper use of the tax file number within the tax file number Bill itself, and that those safeguards should be strengthened as far as possible; and secondly, that more general privacy legislation should be enacted to provide taxpayers with assurances of an even wider kind that their personal privacy would be respected. </PARA>
<PARA> In that last respect, the matter of privacy, I have to say that I do not think we have been well served by the Government and that indeed until very recently, I think the gravest doubts continued to exist-and certainly that includes in my own mind-as to whether the Government's proposals in the privacy area would be sufficiently reassuring to the Opposition, and to myself personally, that we would be able to actually give approval to the tax file number proposal as amended. For one thing, although privacy legislation had been promised during the Australia Card debate-I think I am correct in saying that a Bill was actually unveiled at that time-that earlier Bill was, in a great many respects, defective and, more importantly for the current debate, no new or revised Privacy Bill was produced by the Government until a few weeks ago, notwithstanding that, as I noted earlier, the tax file number proposal itself had been formally unveiled by the Treasurer in the May economic statement and that, of course, we know it to have been in gestation within the Government for some time before that. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when the Privacy Bill was produced it was not formally published. It is true that a copy of the draft Bill was provided, as I understand, by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, to the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, MHR, on a confidential basis so that he would have advance knowledge of what the Government was proposing and be able to react to the form of the draft Bill and to form, as indeed things turned out, the basis of discussions on the draft legislation between him and the Minister for Justice. However, I have to say-I do so with great respect to both gentlemen concerned-that I do not think that a procedure which involves publishing the Bill in a formal manner to attract the wider comments from the public at large-is something which a publication procedure would have enabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be the first to assert that there is much wisdom in the shadow Cabinet, particularly in the person of Mr Neil Brown himself. There may be a little less wisdom than there was until recently; but I will let that point pass. But, as a general rule, proposals of this kind are best handled by exposing them to the more general and public light of day. That was not the course taken by the Government. In what might almost be described as the Government's usual secretive manner, it sought to suppress knowledge of the details of the draft Privacy Bill from the public more generally until after that prior consultative process with the Opposition had been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking personally, that of course puts me under some disadvantage. I am sure it put other non-members of the shadow Cabinet on the Opposition side at a similar disadvantage in assessing for themselves the adequacy of the privacy proposals. Perhaps more seriously, I believe that procedure helped to prolong the wide-ranging and, in some cases, quite passionately held fears which had been expressed about the whole tax file number proposal itself. Let me say a little more about that. I have said, ever since the tax file number proposal was first unveiled, that the final view of the Opposition towards the proposal would, no doubt, have to be arrived at after weighing two clearly conflicting considerations, seeking to balance one against the other and to determine where the balance fell. On the one hand, we have the clear public benefit of intensifying, through the introduction of this proposal, the crackdown against tax cheats and, to a lesser degree, welfare fraud perpetrators. A measure-not the only measure, but a significant one-of the effectiveness of the pursuit of those universally held objectives, held on both sides of the chamber, would be given by the estimates of the net revenue gain to be had from the proposal. Obviously, if the net revenue gain was to be only a very small amount, by that test the proposal would not be very effective in pursuing the objective of cracking down on tax cheats and welfare fraud perpetrators. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, and to be weighed, therefore, against that public benefit, there has been all along the question of the private cost which would be involved in any further intrusion into personal privacy which the introduction of the tax file number proposal might involve. I would say to the Government-the point is perhaps no longer material, but one should seek to learn from what I believe on this occasion to have been a past error-that the more that we in the Opposition and, indeed, the public more generally could be assured about the adequacy of the promised privacy legislation, the more likely we should have been to find ourselves balancing those two conflicting objectives in what one might call the Government's favour, and the more successful the Government would have been in banishing the fears in the community, in many cases genuinely held fears, about the potential threat to privacy which the measure was believed, particularly initially, to involve. </PARA>
<PARA> The holding of this draft privacy legislation as confidential until virtually the last moment was a thoroughly counterproductive method of proceeding, and I hope that the Government will not follow that course on such occasions in the future. Indeed, as a consequence of that we had a reliance by the Government on the Opposition-virtually the Opposition only, because the non-publication of the draft privacy legislation meant that almost nobody else was in a position to comment on it-in the Senate in particular, to fix up the errors which the Government's legislation in this case, as, unfortunately, in so many others, has involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of what I have to say is largely history. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), after a series of discussions with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) put to him finally a series of very significant amendments to the proposed Privacy Bill, in particular an amendment which would have the effect of including in the draft Bill provisions which were addressed specifically to the tax file number proposal. In that respect and in a number of other detailed respects, which will no doubt be covered by other speakers, we have seen a major-a really major-improvement in the quality of the amended final version of the Privacy Bill, which is now before the Senate. In light of that development and in light of the fact that in the course of deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs it clearly emerged that there would be a significant increase in net revenue arising from the tax file number proposal if that system were to be enacted, the final view of the Opposition was that it should accept the tax file number proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It should do so by assisting the Government, in this case, to fix up its own defective legislation. That having been done and a great deal of additional assurance having thereby been built into the Privacy Bill in particular it was felt that the Opposition should not stand in the way of what, taken by itself, is undoubtedly likely to be a quite effective means of pursuing further crackdown on tax cheating and welfare fraud. I repeat that the latter is an objective which is shared on both sides of the chamber and one from which certainly the Opposition has never swerved. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concerns about this proposal from the beginning have been particularly in the area of the privacy legislation. We now believe that both through our repairs to that legislation and through the introduction of what I might call the conscientious objection clause-the voluntary element whereby if people do not wish to provide their tax file number to an agent they can agree to having their income taxed at the top marginal rate-the measures have been sufficiently improved to allow us to approve of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the Government's Tax Summit three years ago it decided that having a national identification system with a national identification card complete with photograph and a magnetic strip or maybe even a smart card with a computer chip on the front of it was a good way of catching tax cheats and the social security defrauders that the Government claimed were littering Australia in their hundreds of thousands. The hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australian citizens who pay their tax, do not get unemployment benefits when they are holding down a job, and do not get age pensions when their income is over the prescribed amount, supported the senators who stood out against the Australia Card proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More by good luck than by good management we managed to foil the Government's proposal, not because we were able to defeat the legislation because the Government had the capacity for a joint sitting after the double dissolution but because it was revealed that the whole thing hinged on a regulation which could be disallowed in only one House of Parliament and the numbers were in the Senate to disallow it. That much is history. The legislation was proposed, it was opposed and, to all intents and purposes, it was defeated. The Government's reaction was predictable. It screamed that it was being denied vast amounts of lost revenue. It screamed that those of us who oppose the legislation were friends of tax cheats and organised crime and social security defrauders, if not actively taking part in all or any of those activities ourselves. It made all of these claims following the defeat of the original legislation despite the fact that in the period between 1985 and the defeat of the legislation the Government had, through a variety of legislative and administrative means, recouped something like $800m of the $1,000m that it claimed it had been losing. I recall on a number of occasions, most recently I think in October of last year, listing the legislative measures, the administrative actions taken by this Government to recoup revenue lost previously through people who were able to rort the tax and social security systems. In 1985 the Government was quite accurate in its assessment that $1 billion was being lost. Where it was wrong was in believing that introducing an Australia Card was the only way to recoup that money. The Government proved that itself by introducing those measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out, too, that the charge of being friends of tax cheats can hardly be levelled seriously at the Australian Democrats, no matter to whom else it may be directed. I remind the Senate that we-not the Liberal and National parties-supported the Government's major tax reforms in its first few years in government. The capital gains tax legislation and the fringe benefits tax legislation covered two areas where often extremely well off people were able to pay less tax than they should have by getting benefits in kind instead of in cash, by avoiding the speculative capital gains prohibition in the tax legislation, but nevertheless making unearned gains, windfall gains, which until 1985 were not taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also supported this Government's main attack on the cash economy, a very real problem in the community whereby people were willing to pay small builders, for example, less for cash than they would have had to pay by cheque. We supported the prescribed payments system and did not resile in any way from doing so. However, what we can be accused of doing is being concerned that tax collecting zeal, well meant and justified though it may have been, could have led to a big brother society in which a centralised databank contained all financial, health and other details about every one of us. If this sort of thing had occurred with an Australia Card or if it occurs in the future-I believe it may well do so as a result of the passage of this legislation, the only difference being that, instead of being given a new number, an existing number, namely, the tax file number (TFN) will be used-it will make it very easy indeed for governments to control, manipulate, if not actually tyrannise, groups and individuals in society. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are those-there are plenty of journalists among them-who say that if people have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear. They say, `I do not care who knows what my tax file number is. I will put it at the top of this article that I am writing on this legislation'. That is fine. I suppose that if one has nothing to hide one has nothing to fear, so long as the situation exists where one knows what it is that one has to fear. If one does not know that, I guess one does not really know what it is that one ought to be hiding. Our society is not based on a system of legislation hinged on the idea that if one has nothing to hide one has nothing to fear. Our system is hedged about with protections of people's privacy. Would those people who say, `Of course we need this sort of legislation' or `Of course we need an Australia Card' and `If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear' feel happy if a State government changed its laws relating to police search warrants so that at any time of the day or night the local constabulary could knock on their front door and say, `Excuse me, but we are looking for some stolen goods or drugs or illegal firearms; can we just rifle through your bedroom cupboards'? This is what we are talking about when we say that we should base society on the idea that everybody should know everything about everybody else and have access to all sorts of private information because if one has nothing to hide one has nothing to fear. That is not the sort of society I want to be part of. </PARA>
<PARA> Letters appear regularly in newspapers from people who object to having their bags searched at supermarket checkouts, on the ground that they are being judged potentially guilty from the minute they walk into the store with a bag. How much more intrusive is it, then, to give a government the capacity to search our financial dealings, Medicare rebates, family assistance benefits and so on? I accept that the remaining areas of revenue loss-the remaining $200m to $300m a year that is lost, the remaining 26c a week per person that is being lost-needs to be recovered. We need to attend to the problems that are causing that loss. The major problem is undeclared interest on invested money, and that can be fixed up without going through this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse is that this legislation will not stop tax fraud. Let us look at what has to be done. People commencing employment with an employer after November 1988 must quote their tax file number on an employment declaration. All employees-including recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits for the purpose of defining what an employee is-must lodge a fresh instalment declaration with each employer on 1 April 1989 and quote their tax file number. By April of next year everybody will be quoting their tax file number to their employer, and there are other areas where the number has to be quoted, such as bank accounts, building society accounts and so on. All employees, all those who open and run bank accounts, must lodge an instalment declaration and quote their tax file number. We all know that there are people in the community who have several jobs. They operate them, if they are smart, in several names-and if they are even smarter, they have several tax file numbers to match those several names. They will go on operating in the same way under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> My younger daughter entered the work force and paid tax for the first time last year. I said to her when she was filling out this year's tax return, `How did you get your tax file number?'. She said, `I filled out the form and they sent it to me'. She filled out the form in absolutely correct detail, but it is possible that someone in her position is also working at night with another name and another tax file number, handed out when that person filled out the first form. Such people are getting two tax-free thresholds and paying a lower marginal tax rate than they should be paying. I doubt very much whether this system would pick that up. The criminal elements, of course, will go on getting away with murder, real and metaphorical, because they have access to all of the false documentation that they need anyway to prove that they are the people or the several people they claim to be-or indeed that they are no-one in particular, if it comes to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst of it all is that, since the original Australia Card legislation met its doom, the Australian Taxation Office appears to have done nothing of any consequence to improve the integrity of the tax file number. The integrity of the tax file number does not mean spreading it around to all and sundry. It means improving its credibility. At the moment it has less credibility than a passport number. The cosy deal that was done between the Opposition and the Government to pass this legislation has achieved nothing except to get their rich mates off a hook. They come into this chamber and say, `Look what we have done-aren't we clever? We have said that it is no longer illegal for people not to quote a tax file number to their employer, bank or whatever. However, the sanction will still apply: 50.25c in the dollar will be deducted from their interest, taxable earnings, and so on'. That is a terrific help to the people you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I are usually most concerned about, people on average weekly earnings or less! People on $100,000 a year can afford to wait until the end of the year to get back from the Tax Office overassessed tax paid. People on $25,000 a year or less, with a couple of kids and a spouse at home, are not in that position. The Opposition cannot walk into this chamber and say that they have made this scheme voluntary. It is voluntary only to the extent that people may be wealthy enough to be able to afford the top rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The two pieces of legislation before the Senate today, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill and the Privacy Bill, which is supposed to protect everybody from infringement, are both still massively flawed and both need amendment. As I have said, tax file numbers are to be used for both employment and investment purposes. The Opposition's agreement with the Government on the non-compulsory quotation of the number is a convenience only for the wealthy. The Australian Democrats intend to move an amendment which will genuinely give all people, whatever their income, a choice about whether to supply their tax file number to the relevant private sector institutions. We have said to the Government, `Yes, create a nexus between the employee or the investor and the institution where people are employed or investing and the Tax Office. If you want that little triangle, you can have it, but don't make it go clockwise all the time. Don't insist that people have to give the number to an institution so that the Tax Office knows they are on the level. Give those individuals a choice. Give them the opportunity within, say, 30 days to let the Tax Office know that that is where they are working and what their name and tax file number are. Then let the triangle be completed anti-clockwise so that the Tax Office gives them the Good Housekeeping seal of approval in regard to the investing institution or employing institution'. That way people will not face the choice, which is not a choice, of either giving their number over to the institution and paying the correct amount of tax or not giving it over and having over half their assessable income deducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading which attacks both Government and Opposition. Indeed, increasingly we have been criticising both sides in this place in the last five years. Indeed, I now move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: `, but the Senate notes that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Government's tax file number system is unacceptably intrusive in that the tax file number will be given to a range of private sector institutions which will not be adequately covered by the Government's privacy legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Opposition parties' amendments to the tax file number legislation are meaningless to the ordinary taxpayer in that they only provide wealthy people with a real option not to supply the tax file number to private sector institutions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Government and Opposition parties are both to be condemned for their failure to support an alternative system which would have caught people who were cheating the tax system and protected the privacy of Australian taxpayers and would not have laid the foundations of a national identification system'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Bill is a piece of legislation for which we have been arguing for as many years as we have been members of this Parliament. It is long overdue. However, in the form in which it is presented to us today it is still very deficient. Worst of all, it will not be an effective protection against misuse or abuse of the tax file number or the legislation behind it. A number of areas require improvement and to at least some of those we will move amendments at the committee stage. The legislation should apply to the private sector. Most of the problems that are occurring with regard to the invasion of privacy come from the private sector. Certainly, they also come from the public sector, but there is no justification for the private sector being omitted from coverage in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The information privacy principles (IPPs) need to be strengthened and there needs to be a provision to sue for damages for breach of privacy. I understand that the Opposition will move an amendment concerning the right to sue for damages for breach of privacy and we will support that amendment. I understand that it will also move an amendment regarding the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's review of a decision of the Privacy Commissioner and we will support that amendment also. However, it is a pity that previous actions by the Opposition parties, in conjunction with the Government, have put this appeals mechanism out of the reach of an awful lot of ordinary people. It is a very real pity that the Opposition supported the Government's increased freedom of information and Administrative Appeals Tribunal charges and costs, because the information that many people will need and the appeals they may wish to take will probably become prohibitively expensive, again, for everybody except the well off. I will detail the amendments more fully at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the information privacy principles are still of concern. Principle 2 deals with the solicitation of personal information from the information subject. One would have thought that the collector of information would be obliged to advise the subject-I love the terminology that draftspeople use-of the purpose of the collection in specific terms. That is not just something we have dreamed up to be difficult. It is, of course, as per Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations and indeed the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. According to the principle, advice should be in specific terms-not just making people generally aware of what is happening, as is the requirement in the current draft. </PARA>
<PARA> Principle 3 relates to solicitation of personal information generally. Again, the collector should be obliged to take reasonable steps-indeed, in some cases even unreasonable and extraordinary steps-to ensure accuracy of information. Again, that is the Australian Law Reform Commission's approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Principle 5 deals with information relating to records kept by the record keeper. The Australian Democrats believe that agencies should be required to disclose additional matters, including purposes for obtaining categories of sources; purposes for which they will be used; purposes of disclosure to third parties; policies and practices with regard to storage; the record keeper's authority for maintaining the system; and whether the information is exempt from access. </PARA>
<PARA> Principle 6 deals with access to records containing personal information. As it is drafted, application of the Freedom of Information Act could be used to deny corrections to inaccurate information. That is simply not good enough. Heaven knows, the original Freedom of Information Act has become what used to be called laughingly in the early days the freedom from information Act. This will only make matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Principles 10 and 11 deal with limits on the use and disclosure of personal information. There are far too many and far too broad a series of exceptions to this. For example, they permit the use and disclosure of information for purposes other than simply its collection by most agencies for most purposes. That certainly needs to be tightened. Information privacy principles 10 1.(d) and 11 1.(e) permit the use and disclosure of personal information where it is reasonably necessary to do so for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty. I guess nobody will quibble about the first of those and, quite possibly, the second, but they also extend to the protection of the public revenue. I cannot think of too many things that we do in this world that are not somehow or other connected with public revenue-giving it or not giving it or getting some of it back. Talk about a catch-all clause! It covers every purpose for which information may be used by all tax collecting and benefit providing authorities of the Commonwealth. No information will be safe. It would, in effect, make most government departments exempt from the two most important information privacy principles contained in the legislation for most of their activities. So I do not know why the Government bothered. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem relates to the non-regulation of information contained in law enforcement databases. This type of information unquestionably can be the most damaging information compiled by governments on individuals. Sometimes the compilation is not necessarily accurate or in context. There is no doubt that both arbitrary and systematic matching of this sort of information occurs at present and this Bill will not impose any review or control by the Privacy Commissioner. We have only to look at the United States or listen to stories from friends in Australia about the problems that arise out of inaccurate computer information being used to accuse individuals falsely. Sometimes that is just information taken out of context; sometimes it is information being maliciously misused; and sometimes it is just because two people with similar names have been confused with each other. Numbers are not a great deal different from names. It is quite possible to see transfers of letters and it is just as possible to see transfers of numbers that are not really there. The need for public disclosure review and assessment of these programs is overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that law enforcement agencies already have adequate powers to obtain information. The legal processes of search warrants and subpoenas include privacy protection by virtue of the prior requirement that an independent judicial officer must be satisfied that the invasion of privacy is justified. That is why we do not have knocks on the door at midnight by the local constabulary wanting to search for a missing stereo unit or the video that disappeared from the house next door. The approach taken in IPPs 10 and 11 removes that protection and that is quite unsatisfactory. IPPs 10 1.(c) and 11 1.(d) are too broad. The only laws which should be included are those which refer specifically to the category of documents or information concerned. We will be moving amendments to cover those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note, on an academic level, that, unlike most Commonwealth laws, the Privacy Bill does not contain an objects clause, even though the Privacy Commissioner's powers are constrained by reference to purposes in clause 29. I am not sure whether it is a matter of irony or a matter of suspicion, but some of those purposes-the general desirability of a free flow of information, for example-cut right across the presumed privacy protection purposes of the Bill. This apparent conflict is going to present the courts with a massive problem of interpretation and contrasts adversely with the Freedom of Information Act, which clearly expresses Parliament's intention that the right of access to information should be the dominant value except to the extent necessary for the protection of essential public interests and personal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> An objects clause should have been included in the Bill. This clause should include provisions such as `personal information acquired for one purpose should not be used for other purposes' and `a national identification scheme should not be established'. Other matters could also have been included, but those are the two major ones. The interpretation section in clause 6 is also deficient. `Personal information' is inadequately defined in that unique identifiers other than names are not included. For example, numbers or symbols can also be used as identifiers. Nor, of course, is information which is computer linked to personal information included. Again, the full privacy protection elements seem not to have been thought through thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of tax file number information, crucial to the workability of the legislation, is an interpretation problem. As it stands, the definition means information `that records the tax file number of a person in a manner connecting it with the person's identity'. This excludes information associated with the TFN or information not directly connecting them with a person's identity. Clause 7 excludes the National Crime Authority from the Bill. I will have more to say about that at the committee stage because there are some concerns in that respect. Clause 15 deals with the application of the IPP but could well prove to be destructive of personal privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, we acknowledge that the Bill is an improvement on the 1986 version on the grounds that any privacy is better than none. I suppose one would have to say that. But it is not sufficient to cover the needs of the tax file number legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, which is part of the Government's program to clear up the tax system. I do not think anyone in this chamber or, for that matter, most people in the community at large can have any doubts whatsoever that this Government, from the day it was first elected in 1983, has been sincere about ensuring that the tax system not only works fairly but also is seen to be working fairly. All members of this House will recall, some vividly and some less vividly, that the tax summit was an attempt by this Government to bring together all the groups in the community-from business to unions to consumer organisation-and to get their views about what should be done to make sure that the tax system in this country works fairly and is seen to be working fairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is in a unique position. We are a young country which so far does not have an entrenched minority of people across the nation who accept that they have certain privileges with regard to taxation or any other part of government activity and who feel that they are above the law. So far, this is the ethos of a very small minority in the community-that is, the rich, the wealthy, the powerful, the greedy and the cynical. So far that group has not been able to dominate the scene in this country as has been the case in a number of other countries. If we examine the tax compliance record of countries such as France, Italy and the United States of America we will see that they have a whole subculture of non-compliance with taxation laws which most people take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> As yet, we have not got to that stage. But the danger signs certainly began to be apparent during the Fraser period with bottom of the harbour schemes, cherry picking schemes and a variety of other schemes drafted by tax accountants and sought by the smarter people in the business community-and I use the word `smarter' in the pejorative sense-to the point where taxation was becoming a laughing matter. I know that John Howard, as Treasurer, was given proposals by his Department and was in the position of discussing options with the business community. For example, he had before him a Cabinet submission relating to a consumption tax which he examined and discussed with some of his colleagues but never brought to fruition simply because it was too hard. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that at various times Prime Minister Fraser was given advice by high level public servants that the tax problem was about to get out of hand. The bottom of the harbour issue made the front page headlines of many newspapers around Australia for a very long time. The unfortunate sequence of events, for Malcolm Fraser, which emanated from the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union suddenly brought home to the average Australian just how deep and widespread tax cheating was throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to power, this Government has followed through some of the minor and half-hearted reforms that John Howard was forced to bring in. We have looked not only at some of the issues raised by the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union but also at the whole issue of tax reform. We accept that in a Federal system it is not possible for a Federal government totally to reform the tax system and the company system without the cooperation of the States. That is, of course, the great difficulty. A fair tax system has two prongs. The first is to ensure that the tax regime itself is appropriate and fair and is seen to be fair. The second, of course, is the reform of the company law itself. We can assume that individuals in the community who wish to evade their tax obligations and responsibilities can manipulate the company code and corporate affairs legislation in various States. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, there will not be complete and effective tax reform in this country until we are able to bring together the States and the Federal Government in pursuit of more effective corporate affairs legislation. I will give the Senate one example. The case for penalties for non-compliance with corporate law in this country, relating especially to annual returns of companies, is very much a problem primarily because the penalties themselves are so weak and because investigative bodies, the corporate affairs organisations around this country, are usually understaffed and there are difficulties in pursuing and prosecuting cases in the courts. As I said, much of this comes back to the establishments of corporate affairs commissions or the various corporate bodies that carry out State responsibilities. The second reason is the law itself relating to companies. To this point I have dealt with this matter with a broad brush. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has already begun the process of tax reform. We have examined the consumption tax proposal to see whether such a tax would bring in some fairness and equity, but in the end we have looked at clamping down on the rorts and the ramps that existed in the system. We examined, for example, the capital gains tax. We looked at Australia in comparison with overseas countries. We saw, for example, that a capital gains tax existed in virtually every Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country. Yet, such a tax did not exist in Australia, except in terms of section 26aaa of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which even for business was an intolerable tax in terms of the way it could be interpreted and operated. So, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Cabinet and this Government, despite enormous protests orchestrated by the Liberal Party and the National Party, brought in a fringe benefits tax and substantiation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, they brought in the principle that people should not have a lifestyle which is tax deductable. One should not be able to drive a Jaguar which is used primarily for private purposes and expect the taxpayer to pay for it. One cannot drive a Mercedes-Benz or a Porsche and write it off as a tax deduction in the way that people were doing in the past. One cannot offer a brilliant young manager the opportunity to have his house totally paid for by the company without any tax being paid on it. One cannot offer a young executive the opportunity to go out on a Saturday night with a dozen people and write the whole lot down on his bill in order to have it as a tax deductible night out. One cannot send one's children to private schools and expect the company to pay for it and then have it tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> All those rorts and ramps had to be brought to an end, and this Treasurer, Paul Keating, did that. He is a politician who has looked at the long term future of this country and said that fairness and equity must be brought into the tax system, that there cannot be one law, one system of practice in terms of tax deductibility, for one group of people and another law or system for ordinary pay as you earn taxpayers. Nor, for that matter, can we have one system for companies which rort the law and another system for companies which try to compete with them but which do things honestly. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience one of the strongest protests about the tax system that existed before we came into government came to me from people in the business community. Admittedly, they were in Tasmania and probably were not used to some of the schemes that operated in a wide open town such as Sydney, where the ethos may be different. These people said to me over and over again, in letters, interviews and discussions we had when we were discussing industrial relations matters, `How can we compete as an honest company, as an honest business, against our competitors who are prepared to use and rort the system in every possible way, who can afford the best tax lawyers, who can afford to argue with the Australian Taxation Office over a two- or three-year period and cop the penalties, but at the end of the day accept the compromises that the Tax Office, understaffed as it is, inevitably has to agree to?'. The loudest complaint coming to me was from those honest people in the business community who did not want to be involved in the twilight and shadowy systems that some of their competitors were involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say by way of anecdote that my first experience with tax rorting was when I first went to work in Sydney in the middle 1960s as a storeman and packer. I worked in an extremely big store in Botany, which was full of woollen and nylon waste. All it did was pick up the scraps from industry and resell them to countries in the system. The company chose us by simply asking us to lift a series of weights, and if we were strong enough we got hired. I am much older now, so I do not think I would pass the same test now. The interesting thing was that my job for the first five weeks was simply to move a quarter of the contents of that wool store from one end to the other and to re-label bales for no other purpose than to allow that company to write off stock in an appropriate way which gave it what I saw as an enormous tax advantage. When it discussed the system with me I was quite surprised that people in this country somehow operated a business on that basis, a complete rorting of the tax system with total impunity. It considered that that was the only way it could compete with the people up the road. There were about 14 or 15 companies in that area which were operating in the same type of business. </PARA>
<PARA> I have progressively watched Australia change as more and more people have sought the advice of tax lawyers and tax accountants and have practised that advice, to the point where in 1983, when this Government came to power, there was a growing discontentment on the part of business, pay as you earn taxpayers and ordinary householders about the way the tax system was working. I believe that we reach a point at which confidence in the system goes completely and the general ethos in the community as a whole is one of `I'm all right, Jack; I will look after myself. If I can rort the system, I will'. When we reach that point, when sufficient people in the community start to believe that, we are in real difficulties. As I have said, some OECD countries have already reached that situation. From discussions I have had with some French and Italian people, I believe that the French and Italian systems are beyond improvement. They will never have a fair tax system. They will simply have to accept the existence of a black economy. They will have to accept that a significant part of their gross national product simply goes out the back door to people who operate in an illegal manner. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has begun the process of tax reform. I have indicated that that process cannot end until we change company law in this country, and that involves a very long and complicated series of discussions being put into operation not only now but also in the future. It means that we genuinely have to believe that company law in this country has to be reformed. But that is down the road. At this stage the Government has looked, first of all, at a consumption tax. We decided that we could not go ahead with that. I think the general feeling in the community was that there were too many questions about the proposal left unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA> We looked at the Australia Card proposal. As we all know, that did not pass the Senate for various reasons, partly I think because people were concerned about alleged attacks on civil liberties and privacy. I think the Government learnt from that exercise. I do not think it was a failure. I thing that on the whole everyone in this Parliament was forced to examine those three issues of tax equity, civil liberties and the protection of privacy much more closely than they had done before. The Opposition can say, `We won. We got someone to find a loophole in the Australia Card legislation. It died in the Senate and therefore we won'. But it is not as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that on the whole the debate had enormous value, as did the work done by the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card, in the sense that it forced at least a minority of this Parliament to examine the issue in depth, to call in people who otherwise would not have been consulted and to put before the Senate a significant body of information, ideas, options and alternatives which is valuable and has been valuable for the Government as it has drafted its tax file number legislation and which has been valuable for the Tax Office and also for the community at large. It is very significant that an option proposed in a minority report, which was partly agreed to by the majority as at least a second-best option, has now appeared before us as Government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats may have some problems in remaining consistent, but then no-one has ever really expected the Democrats to be consistent through their political life. They are the pimple on the backside of politics in that sense. They are important in the process of getting debate going in this chamber, but no-one in the long term expects them to be consistent on matters such as this. They will always find a way out because they appeal to a special interest group out there. They calculate it to be as high as 20 per cent of the electorate; I would put it at about 11 per cent and diminishing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was diminishing even more quickly than at any other time when Senator Vigor was around. Senator Vigor may have been responsible for the massive decline in the membership of the Democrats in this country. He ought to be thanked by this Senate. The Democrats will always find problems with legislation such as this. They will always, like a dancing partner, take one step backwards and keep taking one step backwards until ultimately, I suppose, they are out the door. I can see that Senator Lewis is smiling; when he sees the last of the Democrats walk through that door it will be a dream come true. He has often said that in this chamber. However, we do have to take seriously some of their concerns. We certainly did as a result of the report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card. We looked at the protection of privacy and civil liberties, and for the most part I think their concerns are met in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to the question of civil liberties and privacy. Many countries are attempting to examine that issue not just in relation to tax laws and corporate laws but in general. How does one protect ordinary citizens of this country against autocratic and insensitive actions on the part not only of government but also of bureaucrats-public servant bureaucrats as well as bureaucrats of large private enterprise organisations? I ask the Democrats: which is preferable? Is it preferable to have sections such as 263 and 264 operating in the current tax Act, under which tax officers can search a house or premises without a warrant, enter that property and take records and documents, invade the privacy of individuals, or do they wish to move to another system where the Tax Office does not have to rely upon those sorts of methods to pull back revenue that has been forgone through tax cheating?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be a logical approach to say, `Yes, let's have a tax file number system; let's have a universal identifier which works in the interests of honest taxpayers, which makes it easier for the Taxation Office to do its job', rather than say to the Tax Office, `We don't want a tax file number system. We don't want an Australia Card system. We don't want anything which enables you to do your job effectively and efficiently. We want you to use sections 263 and 264 to invade people's privacy, to rely upon those particular sections', which I have always regarded as very dangerous in terms of civil liberties. Are the Democrats telling us to rely upon those sections or do they want to get back to the legislation which the Government is bringing forward today?</PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make about civil liberties and privacy is that I have heard very little from the Democrats about privacy per se; that is, privacy across the board. It is not just a question of what governments do to restrict or to invade privacy. What sort of system do we want? Do we want proper protection of civil liberties across the board, starting with government, or do we want to be like the Democrats, who raise only the question of invasion of privacy by government and neglect what is happening out there in private enterprise?</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone who has an American Express card or other credit cards such as that knows that at the bottom of the application one signs to get a credit card there is a line which states that the person applying for credit agrees to allow that organisation to share the information provided with other organisations. I am sure that half the Democrats have credit cards and have signed those forms, yet I have not heard one Democrat in this chamber raise the question of uncontrolled invasion of privacy by those credit organisations. Where were the Democrats when the Australia Card and civil liberties and the invasion of privacy were being discussed? We brought to that Committee information which showed that around four million people in New South Wales and Victoria alone are on some form of credit register and do not know that they are on that credit register. They just assume that somehow or other banks know about them. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has been involved in the subpoenaing of individuals in civil matters will know that banks can be required under subpoena to give up to a court all their notes about particular individuals. There is really not much protection of privacy there. I will take Senator Michael Baume as an example--</PARA>

So the problem then is, I suppose, one of unctiousness for the Australian Democrats: that if a government moves to protect civil liberties and privacy, we will never do well enough; just as if we move on conservation issues, we never do well enough. They are after a certain constituency. I will at least give members of the Liberal Party praise in this area. They were prepared to discuss our privacy legislation; they were prepared to propose amendments; and they were prepared to talk about the tax file number and our privacy legislation accompanying it. I believe that out of those discussions this Parliament will be presented with legislation which will take us a long way down the track of having a fair taxation system in this country, a taxation system which is seen to be fair by everyone, and a system of privacy protection which will be the equal of those of most countries in the OECD.</PARA></TALK.START>

If this Government is starting to satisfy the community in terms of fair taxation, if this legislation goes through the Senate as part of that process, the Senate can be commended for once taking a positive view in the interest of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us recognise that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill is being supported by the Opposition only because it has been radically changed. It is now acceptable, whereas when it was first introduced by this Government it was an appalling, offensive, intrusive, badly drafted Bill which gave excessive powers to the Australian Taxation Office and had a hidden agenda of information-seeking which was far removed from its stated purpose of providing additional revenue. That Bill was a disgrace. It showed that, in fact, the Government had learnt nothing from its experience with the ID card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I was intrigued to hear Senator Aulich-I commend him for much of the sweetness and light, particularly the part where he praised the Opposition and attacked the Australian Democrats-and I was interested in his rewriting of history where he commended the Senate for what proceeded from the ID card debate, the Senate inquiry and so on. I remind Senator Aulich that the Australian Labor Party took a negative position on those matters. The Labor Party wanted to ram the ID card through the Parliament and impose it on Australians. It was thwarted in that objective, and now Senator Aulich seeks to rescue something from that mess by saying, `Isn't it wonderful that out of that mess has come much better legislation?'. I say to Senator Aulich: it is no credit to the Labor Party that this has happened. It tried to ram through the ID card and it proposed legislation which was oppressive and intrusive. We have come to this situation we are now in, where we have an acceptable and reasonable Bill, only because of an inquiry that the Labor Party did not want and of amendments to this Bill that the Labor Party was forced to accept because it would have been shown to be even more crooked and dishonest in its approach had it rejected our proposals. This is a vastly different Bill from the Bill that originally came to this House, not simply in relation to privacy but in relation to what the Bill actually does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Messner says, it is a far better Bill; it is a dramatically changed Bill. We had a couple of options when this son of ID card was first presented to this place: we could either reject it as another example of this Government trying to get in through the back door what it failed to achieve with its intrusive and anti-democratic ID card, or we could set out to fix it up. Fixing it up involved an immense effort. We took the view that it was worth trying to fix it up and we have succeeded in doing so, not only on the score of privacy but by removing Labor's hidden agenda from this Bill. That hidden agenda was to make the tax file number not simply an instrument of collecting tax but a universal identifier. It was at that point son of ID card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition took the responsible and decent course. Of course, there were many people who said, `Look, you are in opposition; why should you try to fix up the Government's legislation so that it is acceptable?'. We took the view that oppositions have not only a duty to oppose; they have a duty to try to ensure that the people of Australia are not harassed and oppressed by improper legislation; and we also wanted to ensure that this Government could not dishonestly use rejection of this legislation as yet another excuse for yet another double dissolution, another early election, from a Prime Minister who has consistently said, `We will, of course, allow governments, under the Hawke Ministry, to run their full course'. None of them has yet; of course, they probably never will. This is the last one and presumably the Prime Minister will go early-probably at the end of next year-provided the economy is capable of sustaining such an approach to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government has shown itself to be so dishonest on this matter. For example, on the double dissolution last year, on the ID card, it has shown itself to be so dishonest that this Opposition took the view that it was far better to prevent that dishonesty and to fix up this legislation. As I said, that took a great amount of effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not deal with the privacy elements-Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Minister in the other place, did an outstanding job in ensuring that Labor's hidden agenda in that area would be defeated-but I want to concentrate on the Bill itself and how we fixed that up. We fixed it up in such a way that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says that it is now a much better Bill than the one he introduced. When Mr Keating said that I began to wonder whether we had made a mistake, but this may be one of those occasions on which the Treasurer was not speaking with a forked tongue and maybe he has recognised, as Senator Aulich has, that the Opposition has created through its amendments a most acceptable flower. I suppose one can say that a flower always requires some manure to bring it to fruition. We have produced the flower; the Government has produced the fertiliser. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting rid of Labor's hidden agenda was done very simply with this Bill-it was to make the tax file number totally optional. I believe that that was an essential and saving element. It is no longer compulsory for people to provide their tax file numbers. The upgraded tax file number will now be required only in the relationship between the Australian Taxation Office and the taxpayer. Just as we now have a tax file number, this new system will represent an improvement on that tax file number but the only people who will have a requirement to use that number will be those in the Taxation Office and the taxpayer; just as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer will a taxpayer have to reveal his tax file number to an employer. No longer will he have to reveal it to anyone with whom he invests or does business, as under the original proposal. That is simply dramatic. It prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from building up a profile of all taxpayers-a profile which would be available to other departmental sources. It is all very well for people to say that maybe the Taxation Commissioner could not do that. There is no doubt in the light of experience around the world that function creep goes on. In every country in which there is this kind of identifier there is clear function creep. Despite assurances and even legislative restraints, the tax file number and the information backing it slowly become a passport. For example, in Canada, in order to get a duck shooting licence, one has to quote one's tax file number, or Social Insurance Number as it is called. This sort of nonsense is simply unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Making the provision of the number totally optional destroys the capacity of any government to build up a coherent information pattern, a base of information, or to use the tax file number as a passport for all sorts of other purposes. Of course, we believe that it is absolutely vital not to give more power to the Tax Commissioner at the moment because, as I have said here before, we believe the present Tax Commissioner has stepped over the bounds of being an independent public servant into becoming a spokesman for government policy through things such as advertisements, signed by the Taxation Commissioner, instead of the Treasurer, advertising and promoting controversial matters that are still subject to political debate. That is simply intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much discussion about the nature of raids on various private enterprise organisations by officers of the Taxation Office. It was admitted in one court hearing that the object of the raid, with its drama, its huge backup of people and the refusal to allow the private sector people involved to get appropriate advice, was to create an `atmosphere of terror' under which people would be very reluctant to be involved in any devices which may or may not involve tax evasion. It is no wonder that one of the many serious problems we faced in deciding whether we should fix up this legislation, concerned the behaviour of the Tax Commissioner himself. That added to our difficulty in convincing many people that it was worth while fixing up the legislation. In other words, the behaviour of the Tax Commissioner himself prejudiced our chances of convincing many people in Australia that we should do anything that would give an appearance of adding to his powers. This legislation does not add to the Tax Commissioner's powers. It does one simple thing: it catches tax cheats without in any way adding to the bureaucratic information base, unless the taxpayer chooses to provide his tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is another benefit involved in fixing up this legislation rather than rejecting it outright. It prevents the Hawke Government from using the shabby sort of excuse that it would have inevitably used and now will not be used when next year it fails to deliver its promised tax cuts. We have already seen signs of it. The Government tried to suggest that if this Bill does not go through-at its peak it will raise something like $300m-the proposed tax cuts, which would have to be something like $3 billion to $4 billion to be meaningful, would be in jeopardy. This Government has the capacity and the dishonesty to pretend that if this legislation does not go through it will have been prevented by the swinish Opposition from providing the money for the tax cuts that the people of Australia deserve. That is totally dishonest, but it would not prevent the Government from doing it. We have already heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) threatening to use that kind of rhetoric, accusing the Opposition of being a friend of tax cheats and making other offensive and dishonourable attacks on us, as some kind of precursor to an attempt next year to blame us. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government cannot blame us for anything. Under the massive changes we have proposed to this legislation revenue will be collected, but it will be collected in an honest and honourable way, not by using a device with the hidden agenda of compiling secret banks of information against the wishes of individual taxpayers. The Government has been deprived of an excuse for failing to supply next year's tax cuts. It will be interesting to see how this Government will now explain its failure to provide anything meaningful next year in accordance with its promises. No-one should be surprised that the Government will break its promise yet again; but at least it will no longer be able to blame us. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that had we rejected this legislation instead of radically fixing it up there would have been a double dissolution. It does not take a genius to work out why the Australian Democrats are opposing the legislation. It is absolutely essential for that Party to have double dissolutions. The Australian Democrats look to situations in which they can create a double dissolution by getting the rejection of important legislation twice in this Senate. I say to the Australian Democrats that they will have to try a little harder for a double dissolution because we are strongly of the view, as is Senator Aulich, that they have not contributed in a positive way to the democratic process in Australia. As one of my colleagues recently said, the Australian Democrats are so unreliable these days that it appears from the Labor Party's criticism of them that they can no longer be bought but have to be rented by the hour. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it will be to Australia's benefit if we get out of the habit that seems to have developed in recent years of having double dissolutions whenever a Prime Minister feels like it and whenever the Democrats seek to have one. The reason the Government wants so many double dissolutions is that it prefers to deal with a large number of Australian Democrats because it feels that it can horse trade with them rather than rely on the vote of Senator Harradine if the Democrats are wiped out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course. The Deputy Whip would understand because he is the man who has to try to deal with the Australian Democrats and tie them to deals in this chamber. I can understand his frustration. Let us get back to the question of how massively the Opposition has improved this legislation. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this legislation clearly pointed out that there is a danger of any widely dispersed tax file number becoming a de facto identification number, notwithstanding provisions which prescribe penalties for improper use of the number. An examination of overseas evidence supports this view. That simply cannot happen under the alterations we have made. Under the original arrangements, tax file numbers would have had to be quoted. For example, a person who became an employee would have been required to make an employment declaration stating his or her tax file number. That simply will not happen now. We recognise that there is a consequence of no longer quoting that tax file number, and that is that tax will be withheld at the source at the maximum rate. Of course, the object of that is simple: it means that those people who have multiple jobs, who work under false names, will not have a tax file number, will not be able to provide one and therefore will be taxed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those honest taxpayers who simply do not wish to reveal their tax file numbers will initially have tax withheld, but when they put in their tax returns they will receive rebates, so they will not be worse off except, of course, in terms of timing. Many taxpayers in Australia regret that in recent years their rebates have been so small. Many taxpayers prefer receiving a reasonable tax rebate-particularly if it comes in September or October-to help them over the Christmas holidays. So honest taxpayers will hardly be affected by this situation. Many will prefer to provide employers with their tax file number because, now that the amendments moved by the Opposition to the privacy legislation have been passed, there will be no major disadvantage to a taxpayer in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, tax cheats who cannot provide tax file numbers because they do not have them since they are working under false names will be taxed at source. This means that the Australian Taxation Office will not have to divert hundreds or even thousands of people, computer time and heaven knows what in trying to chase employees who may be working under two or three names. All that bureaucratic nonsense will be cast aside, as will the collection of so much information. It will be simple now. If someone is working under a false name, his or her tax will be deducted at source at the maximum rate. We have shown the Government how to proceed without huge bureaucratic waste; without huge intrusions into the privacy of Australians, and that is why I say we have dramatically changed this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are doing involves raising just about the same amount of tax. There could be some leakage, but there will be very little. It may well be that the tax is raised earlier than it would have been under the Government's incompetent and intrusive system, because those taxpayers who prefer not to reveal their tax file numbers and have the tax withheld at source will be giving the Government a free loan for a while, although those people who pay provisional tax will not be greatly disadvantaged because their withholding tax could no doubt be applied against their provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that some people may still try to cheat, but they will have very little chance of getting away with it. One could find a situation where a taxpayer who did not give a tax file number put in his tax return and, having had the tax deducted at the full rate, claimed a return of the withholding tax, but a false declaration of that kind could be so easy for the Australian Taxation Office to chase that there would be very little prospect of it happening. When a person applies for a rebate, having not quoted a tax file number and having been taxed at the maximum rate, he is almost signalling to the Tax Office that it should at least make a quick check to ensure that the rebate being claimed is correct. So the legislation targets a matching capacity which, I might say, the Tax Office has had for a long time and has simply chosen not to use. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons we are getting this kind of legislation, particularly as it was in its original form, is that the Tax Office has taken a conscious decision not to use the information that every Australian taxpayer is required to provide on his or her tax return. That may startle a lot of Australian taxpayers, but when people fill in their tax forms and those who have investments quote their investments and where they come from, that information is ignored by the Tax Office except for an occasional spot audit. The only thing that is taken into account is the total. Clearly, if the Commissioner of Taxation chose, he could feed all the information taxpayers provide into his computer, match it against the list of dividends paid by the companies that are named on the tax returns and find the names of people who have not filed tax returns. Facilities are available to the Commissioner of Taxation to do all this anyway. The reason it is not being done is that it is too expensive, and I accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has strongly taken the view that it does not want to see excessive spending on bureaucratic devices and that there must be a cost benefit. One of our objections to the Government's initial tax file number proposal was that it was not cost effective in collecting the tax. Frankly, we do not believe that the figures that have been delivered to us are accurate. In fact, the Tax Commissioner has almost an unenviable record of being wrong in his forecasts about what various taxes will provide. So we did not believe that it would be cost effective to have a big bureaucracy. This will be avoided by using the withholding tax system that we have provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does not effectively eliminate tax fraud because the black economy-the cash economy of $3,000m or so-will not be touched one bit by the legislation. What we have fixed up is a peripheral bit of reform-because we have certainly reformed the legislation. The other requirement we had was that the legislation should not unreasonably intrude upon personal privacy and civil liberties. On those three scores we felt that the original legislation was simply defective. It did not effectively eliminate tax fraud; it was not cost effective in so doing-certainly on no evidence that the Commissioner gave-and it did intrude unreasonably upon personal privacy. We have fixed up those criteria so that tax fraud will now be eliminated in terms of employees' and investment income by use of the withholding tax if people choose not to provide their tax file numbers. It is cost effective because it will prevent the enormous growth of the bureaucracy prying into taxpayers' personal information, as would have been the case under the tax file number arrangements as originally proposed. We made certain that it did not unreasonably intrude upon personal privacy and civil liberties by our massive privacy legislation amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that the Government is pretending that the Opposition's amendments are only minor, that they are of little consequence. When we made our first request for an amendment some months ago, which the Government accepted-this was when there was a major change-we said, `You cannot have those terrible penalties for not providing a tax file number'. The Government agreed and said, `Okay, we accept your position that there should be a withholding tax if you do not provide your tax file number'. I stress that in the Bill that recently came into this place it was illegal, according to this Government, for a bank or investment institution not to get a tax file number. A bank or investment body was required under the law to get that tax file number. It is all very well the Government saying, `That did not matter because the only penalty was that the taxpayer had to pay withholding tax'. Can anyone see banks and investment companies happily breaking the tax law even though there was no penalty against them? Obviously they would have demanded from people their tax file number or else refused to open their accounts. What we have done has made this totally optional. </PARA>
<PARA> Our dramatic changes to this legislation not only have made this workable and made it certain that tax cheats will be caught but also have got rid of Labor's hidden agenda. We have got rid of its capacity to use the tax file number as a universal identifier. We have done the right thing by Australians. By stopping those tax cheats, those pay-as-you-earn taxpayers who have formed the bulk of the Australian population will be grateful to us not only for protecting their privacy but also for ensuring that this legislation will collect revenue from tax cheats without being intrusive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988 and the Privacy Bill 1988. As a Government senator I support this very important taxation legislation. There has already been extensive public debate and negotiation on this particular matter. This is an indication of the importance of the legislation. The extent of public concern, especially regarding civil liberties and the right to privacy, has been noted by the Government and absorbed into the legislation for the tax file number. The particular legislation we are debating is the culmination of countless hours of hard work, fine tuning, redrafting and ensuring that all concerns expressed in the community have been met adequately. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, as the Acting Attorney-General, for his efforts in this particular field, particularly in relation to the question of privacy. I would also like to commend the Opposition for its constructive input on this occasion and the bipartisan approach it finally adopted in respect of the tax file number system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the wake of the defunct Australia Card proposal this legislation has generated confusion, scepticism and even hysteria in the Australian community. Initially allegations were made by some members of the public and by the Opposition that this legislation would be a back door method of obtaining a national identification card system. But the Government has repeatedly stated that this is not the case nor was it ever meant to be a national ID system. There is to be no card. There is to be no requirement to carry or even quote the tax file number. At all times the Government has given careful regard to civil liberties and privacy issues whilst looking at this particular legislation. In the past the Australian Taxation Office has been scrupulous about protecting the private information of taxpayers made available to it. The safeguards that are already in place-those that were there beforehand-are very stringent. They are sufficient to ensure the integrity of the tax file number and to protect the rights of the Australian people. However, the new safeguards for this legislation will become even more stringent. There will be severe penalties for abuse or breach of confidentiality. There will be new privacy provisions. These will provide maximum protection of people's rights to privacy in the Australian community. I believe that these new safeguards will meet community concerns about interferences with privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will not give the Australian Taxation Office more information than it presently obtains under existing laws. It will not involve a new data base. It is simply a logical extension of a system already established and in operation. Tax file numbers have been used by the Australian Office since the 1930s. The majority of Australian taxpayers already have one. The principal aim of the new legislation is to enable the Tax Office to more easily match information it already receives from employers and financial institutions with the actual details displayed by individuals in their tax returns. In that way it will help ensure that assessable income is declared to the taxation authorities. The current reliance on matching names and addresses of taxpayers on their tax returns with the names and addresses applied by financial institutions is ineffective, inefficient and full of holes. For example, more than four million reports of interest earned cannot be matched by the Tax Office each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to some allegations which have been made to me as a senator for South Australia by a tax agent in my State who is in favour of the upgraded system. He came to me to ensure that we go ahead with it. In his professional capacity he recently had a client in his office in South Australia who asked him to do his tax return. When the tax agent said, `Fine, I will do your return, this is my fee', the person pulled out not one but six different tax file numbers. This one individual in a tax agent's office in South Australia produced six different tax file numbers and asked the tax agent to do his tax returns for him. This is a stunning case of what has been going on under the existing system where fraudulent names are presumably attached to particular tax file numbers. In all probability in this particular case five numbers were in false names. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure you would agree, Madam Acting Deputy President, as would most honourable senators, that this sort of behaviour is completely antisocial, criminal and cheating on the rest of the community. When looking at that particular individual who had six different tax file numbers-that is, the first $5,100 of income which is exempt from tax-and assuming a 40c in the dollar tax rate, which is a conservative assumption, being applied to that $5,100 of income then that particular individual was saving a minimum of $2,000 per annum on every fraudulent name. Presumably, with five fraudulent names he has picked up a cool $10,000 otherwise payable by him and dumped it onto the majority of honest taxpayers in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent, the tax agent, refused to proceed with this particular gentleman's tax return. He showed him the door. In conveying to me his concern about this matter he pointed out that he had people in his office in Adelaide in the past with three or four different tax file numbers. This apparently is a fairly common occurrence in the community. It was nothing new to him to see somebody with three or four different tax file numbers. He felt that the situation was totally outrageous. As most honourable senators would agree there are cheats out there who are ripping off others in the community. They are not paying for vital public services. After all that is what taxation is about. It is not money that is given to the Government. It is a way of paying for vital public services such as roads, hospitals and schools. These people who are not paying their tax are simply preying on the rest of the community and forcing other members of the community to pay for the provision of these vitally important public services. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent investigation of the cleaning industry, an industry with many casual after hours employees, by the Tax Office at Chatswood in Sydney gives some idea of the problems faced by the current tax file numbering system. A random check of five cleaning contractors in the industry revealed that an average of 68 per cent of group certificates issued, over two-thirds, were not claimed for tax returns. A total of 3,468 group certificates were not lodged. Most were found, on investigation, to include false names and addresses. In this way a substantial sum of income tax revenue is being lost each year to the detriment of honest taxpayers. The majority of people-honest taxpayers-are being ripped off by these cheats and forced to pick up the bill for the payment of important public services. It is estimated that in the next decade some $2,000m will be picked up by this legislation-and that is a conservative estimate. That will ease considerably the burden on ordinary taxpayers and will consolidate the underlying objectives of this Government's tax reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is not intended to increase the total taxation burden in the community, but to ensure that it is more fairly and more equitably borne by taxpayers. These measures will further broaden the tax base, and the Government has given an unequivocal commitment that all revenue raised will go to reducing personal income tax. The next instalment of those reductions will occur probably around the middle of next year. I am sure that the majority of Australians who are pay as you earn taxpayers will welcome these income tax cuts and I am sure there will be substantial reductions in tax which will lead to significant increases in the disposable incomes of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the legislation it will be a lot harder for tax cheats to continue to leach off honest taxpayers in the community. The upgrading of the tax file system will be a major deterrent to tax evaders. An employee who chooses not to provide a tax file number will be taxed at the top marginal tax rate of 49c in the dollar, plus the Medicare levy. The individual who chooses that course of action will receive a refund only when submitting a return at the end of the financial year. It is unfortunate that such stringent measures are necessary to deter tax evasion in the community. It is unfortunate that many people in our society consider that cheating the tax system is fair game. They see it as cheating the Government and do not regard it as cheating their neighbours-which it is. </PARA>
<PARA> People working under false names and welfare fraud have become all too common in the community. This new system of upgraded tax file numbers will make those devices harder. Anybody starting a new job or applying for unemployment or sickness benefits will be asked to quote their tax file number or, if they choose, will initially pay tax at the highest marginal rate, plus Medicare levy, and seek to obtain a refund at the end of the financial year. The tax file number will not have to be used by those persons receiving age or other social security and Veterans' Affairs pensions and benefits. Children under 16 who do not earn enough income to have tax taken out of their pay will not have to quote the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> The upgraded tax file number legislation builds on the unprecedented tax reforms this Government has undertaken since coming into office. Under the Hawke Labor Government reforms of the Australian taxation system, and the personal taxation system in particular, have been unprecedented in Federal history. The Hawke Government has continually demonstrated that it is willing to place tax reform on the political agenda and to make substantial and long overdue reforms to the tax system. For too long successive governments have left tax reforms in the too hard basket. The state of affairs we inherited in 1983 was that for the extraordinarily wealthy income tax had become voluntary. I understand that some members in the legal profession in my home State arranged their affairs at that time to pay the tax they thought was fair. They did not pay the tax that was required of them, but arranged their affairs and determined what they thought they should allocate to pay for vital public services in the community. Substantially we have stopped that sort of behaviour in the community. The Liberal Opposition knew that it had to be done, and yet failed to do so in government. The Liberals knew that reform was urgent. They knew that pay as you earn taxpayers were bearing the burden of tax avoidance schemes designed for and only accessible to the very rich. Instead of reform, Mr Howard, as the then Liberal Treasurer, let tax avoidance and evasion become a national scandal and a permanent disgrace to the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> When in office Mr Howard ignored tax evaders and burdened honest taxpayers with an increasing share of the Australian tax burden. Instead of killing tax avoidance, the coalition government up to 1982-83 nurtured it. In fact, the tax avoidance industry was the only growth industry in the dying days of the Fraser Liberal Government. The economy stagnated, but the tax avoidance industry surged further and further ahead. Mr Commissioner Costigan said in the first report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in 1982 that the tax avoidance industry was the fastest growing industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the coalition Government's professed concern to crack down on evasion and fraud, that Government did the opposite. The truth is that the Liberal and National parties have a shameful record of tax reform. In government they failed to introduce any reforms to the tax system at all. They presided over the most scandalous deterioration of the tax system ever. The former Treasurer never brought a tax reform package to this Parliament. All he achieved was an increase in taxes or the imposition of more taxes. That Government did not reduce taxes as the Hawke Government has done. I refer to the subject of sales tax, which points to Liberal priorities when that party is in government. In Mr Howard's last two Budgets, in 1981 and 1982, he increased sales tax rates across the board by 2.5 per cent. The result was a 66 per cent increase in revenues collected from sales tax-a massive rise in tax on commodities in just two Budgets. No wonder inflation surged ahead in the early 1980s, because of the boost to prices as a result of the sales tax levied by the then Federal Government. All that the then Government achieved was an increase in taxes and the imposition of more taxes. The 1978 Budget introduced by Mr Howard taxed the South Australian brandy industry to the brink by increasing brandy excise by 80 per cent in that one Budget, his first. Under the Fraser coalition the top marginal rate of tax was 60c in the dollar. Under the Hawke Labor Government the top marginal tax rate has fallen to 49c in the dollar. Under Mr Howard the lowest marginal tax rate in any tax bracket was 30c in the dollar. As a result of Labor's tax package the bottom rate is now 24c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals still have the cheek in the community, in the face of that evidence and of those reductions in marginal tax rates, to talk about the need for incentive in the community. Liberal Party rhetoric about tax cuts was highlighted by broken election promises and increased taxes. I well recall the fistful of dollars in the 1977 election, which were taken back within months of that Government's re-election. In the very next Budget, in 1978, not only were those so-called tax cuts taken back, but Mr Howard and the Liberals, who now run around the country parading themselves as the friends of the elderly, took away pensioners' cost of living rises. Despite the fact that they now say that they support the aged and the elderly in this community, in 1978 when Mr Howard was Treasurer and brought in his first Budget he suspended cost of living rises for the aged on their pensions for 12 months. That is the record of people opposite when they get into government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Liberal's speakers' notes come from their secretariat in Barton because they all seem to be saying the same thing. From what I have heard Senator Parer, Senator Panizza, Senator Puplick and Senator Messner say, my name seems to figure prominently in the speakers' notes. Their claim that Labor is a high-tax government is nonsensical. When one boils it down one has to look at the expenditure side of the Budget, the revenue side of the Budget and the Budget deficit. To look at this claim we must go back to the last Budget that Mr Howard brought in in 1982-83 and its outcome. Despite the claim by honourable senators opposite that the Australian Labor Party is a high-tax party, we find that Mr Howard took the easy road. He did not want to do anything about taxation. He took the easy road and ran up a massive Budget deficit. That is what those opposite prefer to do. In 1982-83 they had a Budget deficit outcome equivalent to 2.7 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. Their record was a Budget deficit equivalent to 2.7 per cent of this country's national income. They were not prepared to do anything about covering their expenditures by their revenues. They took the easy way out-the Liberal way out-which is to run up massive Budget deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Budget Papers show very clearly that despite the bleatings on Monday night by Senator Panizza and Senator Parer, who attacked me, and the bleatings today by Senator Puplick and Senator Messner, those people in government were not prepared to do anything to make sure that government expenditures were covered by revenues. They were prepared to run up deficits. That was their record. In 1982-83, the last financial year in which the Liberals were in government in this country, they left a Budget deficit equivalent to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product. Let us not have any more nonsense about Labor being a high-tax government. Those opposite ran up very high expenditures. They were not prepared to fund those expenditures by revenues and they left a legacy of substantial Budget deficits. The Budget Papers show very clearly that they were totally irresponsible financially. They were not prepared to do anything about taxes. They took the easy road by running up very large Budget deficits and simply left it to other governments to clean up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. I gather that he was over the road at, I think it is called, Treasury Place-the building across the way where the Department of the Treasury is headquartered. Of course, Mr Stone would have been the Secretary to the Treasury at that time, advising the Government. The Liberals' record in Government leaves them with no credibility at all on taxation. While in opposition for 5 1/2 years-they are looking at another 1 1/2 years in opposition at least-they have repeatedly opposed every major measure taken by the Hawke Labor Government against tax avoidance and evasion. From the fringe benefits tax to the abolition of the free lunch, they have opposed every measure brought forward by this Government to crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion in the Australian community. On many occasions in late 1985 and early 1986 in the previous Parliament I debated legislation to knock off the free lunch-the so-called free lunch enjoyed by the pinstripe business brigade in Sydney and Melbourne and the big cities at the expense of the Australian community. Week after week, month after month, the Liberals came into the former Parliament and defended that outrageous rort. Despite all the evidence that it was an outrageous rort, they said that the restaurant industry in Australia would be on its knees and that the end of the world as we knew it was nigh. In effect, what they were really saying was that people would stop eating. That is what their arguments really boiled down to. When we took them to the barrier on the abolition of the free lunch they were saying, in effect, that people would stop eating as a result of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened as a result of that crackdown? We saved honest Australian taxpayers substantial revenues. While the Opposition made various claims about this rort-for instance, that the revenue saved would be insignificant-we are now saving about $330m every financial year. I am not talking about $3m or $33m: I am talking about $330m which will be gained every financial year simply by abolishing the rort that those opposite still seem to defend to this day. When the next election comes around I will be looking very carefully at their taxation policy, as I am sure all honourable senators on this side will, because I want to see what they say about the free lunch. Would they bring back the free lunch and penalise honest Australian taxpayers, ordinary people, who do not have the ability to go and have big lavish lunches in expensive restaurants in major cities? Would they bring back the free lunch and take away $330m from government revenue? I will be waiting to see what those people do when the next election comes up. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Opposition has decided to support this legislation. But, of course, it would have lost even more credibility in the Australian community and would have been labelled as being hypocritical had it not done so. It has been brought to my attention that the Western Australian Division of the Liberal Party, which is in your State, Madam Acting Deputy President, still opposes the legislation. While Mr Howard and the Opposition front bench support the legislation to introduce an upgraded tax file number in the tax system, the Western Australian Division of the Liberal Party, populated as it is by nouveau riche speculators and other sorts, still opposes it. I have before me a letter from the Western Australian Division of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia signed by Mr Simon Ehrenfeld to a person who is, presumably, a Liberal Party member of parliament. It begins `Dear James'. I am not sure whether that means Mr James Porter: I do not know whom it is addressed to. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax file numbering proposition being put forward, we feel, is totally repugnant to the people you claim to represent. </PARA>
<PARA>So obviously it was sent to a member of parliament. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Our policy of opposition to this threat has been unanimously supported by the Liberal Party's Western Australian Division, who further supported the view that the proposal represents a gross invasion of civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter is not old; it is not something from the dark ages. It is dated 26 October 1988, only two weeks ago. That is a further indication of the cracks and divisions in the coalition and the Liberal Party in Australia. While we have a united Labor Government bringing in reforming legislation of this sort, and while Mr Howard and his front bench are on the record as supporting the legislation to introduce an upgraded tax file number system in Australia, the Western Australian Division of the Young Liberal Movement, through Mr Simon Ehrenfeld, the Administrative Director of the Western Australian Division, says that the legislation is repugnant. Senator Crichton-Browne is a member of the Western Australian Division and I will be listening with great interest to what he says about the legislation in this debate. I notice that he is on the speakers' list. But one part of this hopelessly divided Liberal Party is still taking a position opposite to that taken by its leadership and front bench. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is doing exactly what was commended by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, on 7 October 1987, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We will support moves to upgrade the tax file numbering system. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in recent times various parliamentary committees have also recommended the introduction of a high integrity tax file numbering system. I believe that an upgraded tax file number should receive widespread community support in Australia. Most Australians are fed up with and resentful of the unfairness associated with the substantial tax avoidance by a minority in this community. The only group which has any reason to fear the tax file system is that group which has exploited and cheated the system through avoidance and evasion at the expense of the vast majority of honest taxpayers. Honest citizens have nothing to fear-in fact, they have much to gain-from this legislation. Once again under the Hawke Labor Government, the number is up for the tax bludgers in the Australian community. This time we are to have an upgraded tax file number. The sooner we get it into operation the better it will be for the majority-the honest taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few moments that are available to me before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I want to say that from what I have heard of the debate so far I am quite astonished by the claims of the Opposition that it has radically changed the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988 and the Privacy Bill 1988, with which it is linked. I will elaborate on that point later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The efficiency of the tax collection system in this country is something that should receive due consideration from all political parties and all individual members of Parliament and, indeed, it does. However, I think we need to look at the question of efficiency. Certainly, that is what the Australian Democrats and a great many people in the community have done. Senator Michael Baume said in his speech, in referring to the Liberal Party of Australia, or probably to the Opposition generally, `We do not want to give the Commissioner of Taxation more power'. That is not a particular problem for the Australian Democrats. Certainly, we are interested to see that people meet their tax liabilities-we would like to see it extended as far as Alan Bond and a few others-but we do not want to put in place a system in which extensive databases are able to be misused and people's privacy is not protected across the board. However, we do want an efficient system. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is how far we can go in the pursuit of efficiency. We could have a very efficient economy in this country if we eliminate all economically dependent people. Of course, this would not include children because they might become economically efficient when they grow up. But, obviously, we would have to eliminate the old, the infirm, the disabled and the unemployable, young or old. Our economy would be very efficient but such a proposal would not be socially acceptable. Probably the most efficient system in the area of tax collection was the Australia Card proposal, but the Australian community made its view quite clear on that proposal by using the sorts of terms that I am sure it would use if we decided to eliminate the economically dependent people in our community. Perhaps the most efficient means of identification would have been a tattoo on the forehead, but the Government did not decide to put that proposal before us. We are looking for a system which is efficient, which will work and which might give the Taxation Commissioner more powers. The Australian Democrats have no problem with that. The issue for us is to ensure that people's privacy is not unnecessarily impinged upon by whatever system is deemed by the Parliament to be the most efficient. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I ask: Why has the Government chosen to abdicate its responsibility to Aboriginal Australians by instituting a series of in-house inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal affairs which will involve no community participation? How will the Minister guarantee that opportunities are available to persons wishing to contribute when the routine procedures of the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner, the Department of Finance and the special investigator, Mr Menzies, discourage involvement by people outside the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2287" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I wish to say very firmly and adamantly, if that is not a tautology, that the Government has not abdicated its responsibilities in relation to these matters. Indeed, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have said, right from the beginning of this parliamentary inquisition into the affairs of the portfolio and particularly into allegations of mismanagement and maladministration, that no stone would be left unturned in uncovering the facts to enable the Parliament to make its proper assessment of the validity of the allegations that have been made. As Senator Tambling would know, the hundreds of questions he provided in writing, the several hundred with which he supplemented those written questions when he questioned, face to face as it were, officials of the Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission at Estimates Committee E, further supplemented by his very many questions that were incorporated for further answer, went largely to the allegations of maladministration and mismanagement. Some allegations of corruption were also made, no doubt the implication being that this was facilitated by poor management and administration processes, techniques and supervision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is very proper that the Government should respond in the way in which it has, namely, to ask the Auditor-General not only to look at the Aboriginal Development Commission but also to extend his inquiries into the Department and for the Commissioner of the Public Service also to conduct an inquiry. At the end of the day, if those inquiries are judged by Mr Menzies to require supplementation, he will undertake those further inquiries which, as I have said, will give the fullest and most complete picture possible to Government for the compiling of a report to be made available to the Parliament. As has been said, one can expect that the result of those investigations will be made available to the Parliament early in the autumn session.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that those persons who can best assist these inquiries will feel no difficulty about contacting the Auditor-General, or Mr Menzies if it comes to that, as indeed they have done on past occasions when, for example, Mr Menzies has conducted other inquiries. I believe that the contributions will be made in a way which will be helpful to those inquirers in carrying out the tasks I have outlined. I believe there will be no discouragement of such persons. People will come forward, particularly those with knowledge of the administration and management of both the Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission. The Government and the Parliament will be well served by the inquiries that have been set up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I believe that the Minister has missed one of the crucial points I raised, which is that, because there is no protection of witnesses or genuine access for the public, is not the form of government-sponsored inquiry calculated to protect the Minister from inquiry rather than further the public interest in a free and open inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In no way has this pro- cess been established in a calculated manner to protect anybody. The process has been established in order to fulfil the legitimate expectations in the Parliament and in the general community that all elements of the administration and management of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, involving as it does the commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds, should be exposed to expert scrutiny. I believe that at the end of the day it will be found that those inquiries well serve the Parliament and the general public.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2289" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was in Seoul earlier this year I had the opportunity of talking not only to Australian athletes and their coaches and officials but also to coaches, officials and athletes from a number of other countries. In the course of discussions that I had there it became pretty obvious that whilst this Government had finally done something for sport in Australia, more needed to be done. Since my return I have sought to start the sports community in Australia thinking about what role government should have in the area of sport in the future. In looking at that I have considered support for the training of coaches. I think that coaching has been one of our weakest areas. I have looked at the infrastructure and the proper provision of it. I have also looked at the support for our elite athletes, the real champions. There is also the area of talent identification, in which Australia has been sadly lacking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst we have done a lot to support sport, there is obviously a great deal more that we can do. On a number of occasions lately I have talked about the Government taking more responsibility in the coaching area. In the Budget there was an announcement of a new plan for community sports facilities, which will go a long way to addressing some of the infrastructure problems. Obviously, whatever the Government has to do in the future for Australian support, a much greater commitment from the corporate sector is required, because the other thing I discovered from talking to those officials, athletes and coaches from other countries is that the corporate sector in Western Europe and the United States of America plays a much greater role than it does here. However, I will not make learned pronouncements on my own. I have asked the Australian Olympic Federation, the Australian Institute of Sport and a host of organisations and individuals to come back to me by the end of February and tell me what they think ought to be done. I am about to sign letters that I have written to all the State Ministers for sport asking them to do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Committee on Finance and Public Administration is concerned, I have referred the problem of sports funding to it. It has set up a subcommittee which consists of, I think, Steve Martin, Ric Charlesworth and George Gear, and Stewart McArthur and Roger Shipton from the Opposition. They will look at sports funding and administration and come back to me, I think pretty soon. I think we could do a bit more in the area of administration. Once they have finished and I have all of those other reports, I hope I can go forward.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no criticism, implied or otherwise, in anything I have said about the Australian Institute of Sport. There does need to be more decentralisation as the parents of young children-often Olympic athletes are as young as 13 and 14 years of age-are very reluctant to have those children leave home for long periods to come to Canberra or to go to other places, and that may mean the AIS needs to decentralise even more. As you are aware, Mr President, over the last few years a number of sports codes have been set up in centres around the country. We may need more than one centre for each sport; we may need two or three.</PARA>

It was on this basis that an interim injunction against Brian Toohey was sought and obtained in the High Court last night, supported by an affidavit affirmed by me yesterday afternoon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are serious lapses of taste being demonstrated on a number of fronts these days by Senator Hill since his elevation to the front bench, but I suppose that is something we will have to live with. We, of course, knew that the publication of the November issue of The Eye was imminent, but since that magazine has not appeared to a precise schedule in the past, we did not know, in the absence of further inquiries, whether it had been printed or whether preliminary distribution had in fact commenced at the time that I affirmed by affidavit yesterday. It would obviously not have been possible to make such inquiries without precipitating the very problem of disclosure that the court action sought to avoid. In fact it now appears that the November edition had already been printed at the time we received the information to which I have referred-that information, I repeat, referring to the next edition of The Eye-and the November edition appeared accordingly this morning without any reference, as Senator Haines has said, to ASIS. It was, of course, always possible that the reference to the next edition on which we acted could have been a reference to the next edition after the November one, but we had to proceed on the conservative assumption that the edition due to be published in early November was the relevant one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the gales of synthetic indignation that we have been hearing from Mr Toohey this morning, and which have been partially repeated by his hitherto not known as accolytes on the front bench opposite, I would be prepared to take those public protestations a little bit more seriously if Mr Toohey was prepared to swear as follows: that he has no previously unpublished material in his possession or control purporting to identify ASIS personnel, areas of operation or activities, and that he has no plans to publish such material in a subsequent edition to The Eye or through any other avenue.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible for me to make any comment on the substantive matters involved in this case, not least because it is still before the court. Neither I nor the Government make any apology whatsoever for acting as we see fit in the national interest, and we will continue to so act in this matter as elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dunn has asked me a number of questions regarding the involvement of Mr Greenslade as an officer of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in the Senate committees and elsewhere. The answer to the questions, as they have been directed to me, is firstly, yes. I am aware that Mr Greenslade, who has acted as special adviser to the Committee for some hearings, was withdrawn on 17 June 1988 from an in camera hearing of the Senate inquiry dealing with nuclear weapons issues. An ANSTO officer explained that the ANSTO board considered that it did not want ANSTO officers involved in the safety assessment of nuclear weapons capable ships. The answer to the second part of the question as to the interpretation of the existing Act is yes; I am aware that this was done because of the ANSTO board's view that such involvement may be contrary to section 5 (2) of the ANSTO Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the advice received from the Attorney-General's Department was that the organisation would not be in breach of the Act. That was contrary to the view of the Board. The Chairman of the Committee has provided a written assurance that the duties of the specialist adviser do not constitute research or development into nuclear weapons. The Government would view very seriously any such work being undertaken. Finally, Mr Greenslade has been seconded for short periods to act as special adviser to the Committee. ANSTO, including Mr Greenslade, has no competence on nuclear weapons design, storage or safety but has provided considerable technical assistance to the Committee. It is considered that in relation to the provision of assistance on nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ANSTO's competence is limited to the dispersion and health consequences of nuclear materials and does not include the safety of or accident probability associated with such devices.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been saddened, as I am sure will all members of Parliament, to learn of the devastation caused by a very large earthquake, measured at some 7.6 on the Richter scale, which has hit in Yunnan Province in southern China, near the Burmese border. Reports now indicate that over 900 people have been killed and many more injured. Almost all the houses in the epicentre-that is, in the Lancang and Menglian counties-are believed to have been destroyed. The Government is closely monitoring the situation and reports have been received from the Australian mission in Beijing. Further reports are also expected shortly from United Nations agencies. The Government is concerned that the area affected is a remote region and that the initial reports may in fact have understated the number of casualties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the people of Australia, the Government wishes to express its very sincere sympathy to the Chinese Government and condolences to the Chinese people for the loss of life and damage to property arising from this tragedy. We understand that a major relief effort has been mounted by the Chinese authorities. As in the past, the Australian Government stands ready to provide assistance to the victims of the earthquake in the event of an appeal for such assistance. China does not always seek external assistance for victims of natural disasters. Australia needs to remain sensitive to the wishes of the Chinese and, in particular, to their strong feelings of self-reliance, but if a request for assistance is made we shall certainly give it urgent and sympathetic consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs and follows the question he was unable to answer last Friday on the significance of the status as an authorised trustee investment of Rothwells Ltd. As a preface to the question I advise the Senate that the Minister very kindly sent me some documents from his Department following that question, including a booklet called The Retiring Consumer, which gives the valuable advice that before one decides on an investment one needs to know certain information. One of the things one needs to know is the security of investment. I thank the Minister for that helpful advice. I ask the Minister: Has he examined the role of the Western Australian Government, both as the grantor of the status of an authorised trustee investment to Rothwells Ltd and as a one-time guarantor of Rothwells? So that the Minister does not think this is some theoretical matter, I ask him whether he has seen the report on the front page of the West Australian newspaper last Friday that a mother and daughter face the loss of their life savings. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen last Friday's West Australian newspaper. Having had this question raised with me last week, I thought it was important to follow it up. As Senator Chaney would very well understand, the whole question of authorised trustee investments and the designation thereof comes very much under State law. Across the country we have different requirements as to the criteria a company has to meet before that company can, under State regimes, be classified as an authorised trustee investment fund, which, as Senator Chaney would know, then makes it eligible for investment by trust funds. As I said, the regime is under the State legislation and the criteria are very much part of State legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we were to look at the applicable provisions that pertain to this matter, we would find that in Western Australia to be an authorised trust fund a particular company has to have a paid up capital of $5m and a record of paying dividends in each of the 15 preceding years. If this is compared with other States such as Victoria and New South Wales, it will be found that the requirements there are stricter. For instance, in Victoria the requirement is for a paid up capital of $50m, a five year dividend record and an appropriate asset/liability ratio. In New South Wales, a high credit rating is also needed.</PARA>
<PARA> In going back to find out about these matters, I discovered that Western Australia has the most liberal laws in this area. They were introduced in 1978-under, I believe, the Government of which Senator Chaney was a supporter.</PARA>

That is that there is a requirement that a trustee obtain proper advice before investing in such a company.

If he has not, will he please do so, and report to the Senate? Following his comment about the obligation on trustees to get advice, can I remind him of that part of the question which he ignored, which was referred to in the quote I gave from the depositor who is so hurt about the Western Australian Government's role? What about the Western Australian Government's role in giving advice effectively on this matter, in standing as a guarantor behind the bank for a good deal of the last year, and giving the impression that this was a safe investment? Has he made any examination of the role of the Western Australian Government in that respect?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite strange getting these sorts of questions from Senator Chaney. They are based on a premise that maybe something was done unusually in terms of accreditation of Rothwells. If Senator Chaney is suggesting that, I would like to get some evidence as to what that unusual aspect was. As I said to the honourable senator, there are criteria that are laid down by State legislation. Even though he makes the presumption that something unusual was done, he does not actually claim that in terms of getting that authorisation something unusual or improper was done. If he has any information on that, then that might warrant some need to check out the method of obtaining accreditation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the Western Australian Government's role-cheap shots were made last week about people being lawyers and not being up to scratch in that respect-I am sure that Senator Chaney and others in the Senate would know that if advice was given and if guarantees applied, then the normal course of law would apply and people who have been damaged because of, say, a lack of responsible behaviour or in the presence of negligence, have their rights under the existing law. That is pretty basic. I should have thought that that would have obviated the need for the honourable senator to ask such a cheap supplementary question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the Orwellian newspeak efforts by the gold lobby is to label what this Government is doing in extending normal company taxation to the gold industry as a gold tax. It is not a gold tax; it is an extension of the normal company taxation regime. There is a gold tax, however, in Australia, and it is applied in four of the States and the Northern Territory. There is no gold tax operating in Victoria, and there never has been, or in Western Australia, and there never has been. But in New South Wales there is a gold tax, and it is a tax of 4 per cent of the value of production. In Queensland there is a gold tax-2 per cent of the gross proceeds in excess of $30,000 or 5 per cent of net profit above $30,000, whichever is the greater. In South Australia there is a gold tax-2.5 per cent of the value of production. Tasmania has a gold tax as well. Tasmania has a progressive royalty rate with an option for ad valorem or profit-based royalty ranging from 2.5 per cent of revenue or 5 per cent of profits to 3.5 per cent of revenue or 7 per cent of profits. There is also a gold tax in the Northern Territory. It is 1.25 per cent of ex-mine value of the gold or 2.5 per cent of same value in the case of mining on Aboriginal land or reserves. Mines that commenced construction after 30 June 1982 are charged 18 per cent of profit before income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are the gold taxes that apply in Australia. They are State or Territory taxes. Western Australia and Victoria do not apply them. The gold lobby has tried to label what this Government is doing in closing off an anomaly and a loophole in the company tax regime. It ought to be clearly understood in the community that that is not a gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt asked me whether I was aware of whether Mr Howard has done any-thing about that. I am aware that Mr Howard, in a video relay to New York investors, indicated support for the Government's position, as have Senator Stone and Mr Peacock previously, but now that they have been rolled in the party room or, more particularly, within their executive, there is a big backdown and a cave-in to the gold lobby in the Liberal Party. I am not aware whether the Leader of the Federal Liberal Party, Mr Howard, has spoken to the Liberal Government of New South Wales and asked it to remove its gold tax or to the National Party Government in Queensland, to the Labor Party in South Australia, to the Tasmanian Liberals, and to that weird creation the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and asked them to remove their gold taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other problems about a gold tax is that many headline writers seize upon it because the lobby has successfully promoted this misrepresentation as a shorthand way of describing what this Government is doing. I am drawn to an article in the West Australian this morning which refers to gold tax, but I am more drawn to the editorial in today's West Australian. In its opening paragraph, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite dire predictions from the gold industry and from soothsayers on both sides of the political fence about the impact of a gold tax, there is no valid reason for continuing the industry's tax-free status.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to headline writers that rather than fall for the ploy of the gold lobby and call what this Government is doing in closing off an anomaly a gold tax, they would be advised to use some other form of words. Perhaps they could call it, `Company tax on gold (at last)'; perhaps they could call it, `Tax anomaly on gold' instead of `gold tax'; perhaps they could call it, `gold exemption' rather than `gold tax'; or perhaps they could say, `Gold companies to be taxed like other companies' instead, or `Gold loophole to be closed off'-rather than continue the Orwellian doublespeak of gold tax that the lobby has so successfully perpetrated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would be aware, it is the case that an experiment is presently proceeding as a prelude to what will hopefully be a permanent transfer of parliamentary broadcasting away from Radio National. That interim arrangement involves the broadcasting of Parliament on an interim network where the transmission power is significantly less in a number of areas than is the case under the full-scale Radio National network. It needs to be appreciated at the outset that the statutory obligation which Senator Stone's parties in Opposition have endorsed and not contested or sought to expand in the past is a statutory obligation that confines the need to broadcast to the metropolitan areas. Therefore, if Senator Stone cares to think of it as a bonus-I am not sure that I do-the receipt of parliamentary broadcasts in the past in some areas outside the metropolitan has been in the nature of a bonus rather than something that was involved in the statutory obligation. I would have thought that most of the people to whom Senator Stone referred would regard it as a blessed and merciful relief not to have to listen to his dulcet tones, or those of any other member of parliament for that matter, under the new arrangements. If Senator Stone has a view to the contrary, no doubt he will be able and willing to express it at the appropriate time and place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That the allegations were quite unsubstantiated, and were indeed quite ridiculous, was not mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA>They were not mentioned by the Press. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> When the new government took office in New South Wales, one would have expected an immediate investigation into such serious allegations, of which the Greiner Government made full use before the election. Nothing happened. The matter was dropped.</PARA>
<PARA> Though my husband was quickly identified by the media as the candidate in the Castlereagh by-election and we suffered harassment for 24 hours, that is not the reason why I am seeking a statement from the present Government to set straight the record. I am appalled that an irresponsible and mischievous story was used without the facts being investigated, and that, having served its purpose, it was dropped without any consideration of any damage it had done to innocent people.</PARA>
<PARA> I have written to Senator Bishop, but received no answer.</PARA>
<PARA> A letter to Mr Greiner elicited an unsatisfactory answer.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> As I am quite determined to seek from the Senator or Mr Greiner a reason why the story was dropped, I would be grateful for any efforts you may make to help me.</PARA>
<PARA>Probably what that brings to mind is that if unsubstantiated allegations are made in this place not only are they made for the purposes of political gain but also there is another side to the story. This particular family has been deeply hurt by those allegations because, obviously, living in that area people ask them about it, or fail to ask about it and just look at them. The allegations also hurt the returning officer who ran that election. The allegations hurt the Federal returning officer who is one of the most diligent officers ever to be employed by the Australian Electoral Commission, who meticulously took off the roll the names of deceased persons. It comes as no surprise to me that in this chamber, two days before the New South Wales State election, these issues were raised and that those who raised them pursued them no further. Not only did they fail to pursue and try to substantiate the allegations before they were made but, having made them, having had their electoral thrill on election day and having overrated their effect, they then dropped the matter and did nothing about it. They did not worry about the people who were hurt by those allegations. What the allegations involved was criminal conspiracy. The Premier of New South Wales and the senator from New South Wales who were involved in those allegations have failed to pursue them in any way whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan asked what remedy we have. There is very little remedy. The election was run under State electoral law; our involvement was to provide the rolls. At this stage it would be almost impossible for us to initiate those sorts of inquiries given our limited involvement in it at the time. For the last time I hope, I urge the Premier of New South Wales, I urge that New South Wales senator, to back up those allegations, to provide a proper inquiry and to clear the names of people such as Mrs Curran who have been so viciously smeared.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly do, Mr President. They relate to the financial consequences to the Commonwealth of a decision made by Sir Charles Court that was not trammelled by logic. Contrary to Senator Chaney's belief I did not omit the first sentence of the article he wrote in 1984 for any ulterior motive at all; indeed, I omitted it from a desire to protect Senator Chaney from the dangers of guilt by association with Sir Charles Court. Certainly, in regard to problems being solved by logic, nobody who knows Sir Charles Court would ever accuse him of allowing logic to impede the pursuit of his obsessions and self-delusions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The greatest demonstration of the eclipse of economic logic by megalomania was the $7 billion to which Sir Charles Court and the previous Liberal Government of Western Australia exposed Western Australian taxpayers under the misconceived take-or-pay contract in negotiations for the North West Shelf gas. There were many defects in the arrangements in that take-or-pay contract which Sir Charles Court instructed the State Electricity Commissioners to sign, but the financial implications to the Commonwealth were as follows: Following exhaustive negotiations in late 1984 and early 1985, in which the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, was the principal Commonwealth participant, the State Labor Government rescued the situation by negotiating with the Commonwealth and the joint venture partners a three-way pain-sharing agreement which involved, among other things, the Commonwealth Government forgoing nearly $120m worth of royalties, which had the effect of reducing the State Government's maximum exposure from $7 billion to $2 billion. Even with that massive salvage exercise by the State Government, a huge albatross still hangs around the necks of the Western Australian Government and taxpayers as a result of the Court Liberal Government's self-delusions and obsessions.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I table a letter from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade in Western Australia dated last month from a Mr McKee, the Co-ordinator General. My final comment on this matter is that the son of the Sir Charles Court who did not allow logic to impede the pursuit of his self-delusion in exposing the State of Western Australia to a debt of $7 billion, subsequently reduced to $2 billion because of negotiations in 1984 and 1985, has the effrontery to try to make the running on the present issue of concern in Western Australia.</PARA>

I am not sure how much more insulted a scientist could get, because to be insulted by Geoff Muntz on the basis that one does not know what one is talking about is indeed an insult that one takes to heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by Dr David Ride, the Vice-President of the IUBS, that, contrary to Mr Muntz's claim, the IUBS resolution was one of seven general resolutions that were passed by that body at its recent meeting. According to its protocol, consideration of such resolutions is allowed. The resolution and the proposal for listing as well as Queensland's counter proposal and the arguments which Queensland had advanced were circulated to all delegates well beforehand. The agenda committee looked at the resolution and put it up for debate in the final plenary session of that assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the resolution was passed should not surprise anyone. It should be remembered that this body has delegates affiliated to the Royal Society, the United States National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council of Canada, and the science academies of West Germany and France, and it was attended by leading scientists from all around the world. Mr Muntz and the Queensland Government have a great problem in ever coming to grips with scientists. Every time they try they run into strife. They set up a committee called NORMA, the Northern Rainforest Management Agency, which was to advise them very cleverly of how wrong we were in seeking to nominate the rainforest area. The reason why that body has never endorsed the Queensland Government's announcements is that it never decided what the Queensland Government decided it should decide-because scientists, being what they are, have some integrity. I only wish Queensland politicians had half as much. The NORMA scientific committee disowned Mr Muntz as soon as he made the announcement. The committee would not wear it. Indeed, several scientists have publicly dissociated themselves from Mr Muntz's statements.</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that a very prestigious scientific body did pass a resolution agreeing with the Commonwealth. So far as scientists are concerned, the members of that body are not the only ones who agree. Over 60 internationally respected Australian and international scientists have written to me already. They include such people as Professor Peter Ashton from Harvard University; Professor Paul Richards from Oxford University and Professor Peter Endress from the University of Zurich, and there are many more. When it comes to scientific evidence, Mr Muntz going on a television program proclaiming that an international body of the distinction of this one did not know what it was talking about is farcical. Mr Muntz will find out in December what the world scientific community thinks when the World Heritage Committee meets. At least a decision at that stage of the game finalises the matter, and even he cannot bring it undone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to a question put to me yesterday by Senator Peter Baume in relation to the Woden Town Club. Earlier this year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) requested from the Aboriginal Development Commission, through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, a brief on ADC funding of the Woden Town Club Aboriginal Corporation. The briefing note, dated 27 May, outlined the history of the Woden Town Club as far back as August 1986. It was at Commission meeting No. 40 held in August 1986 that the ADC commissioners approved the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) A grant of $286,300 and a loan of $100,000 to the Woden Town Club for the purpose of refurbishing/renovating the basement area of Bonner House to be operated as a licensed club;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A guarantee of up to $75,000 to secure a bank loan for working capital.</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 August 1987, the General Manager approved, under Delegation, an additional grant of $10,000 and a bank loan guarantee for an additional $43,000 to enable the Club to meet increased renovation costs. All ADC grant and loan funds have been released.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the briefing note stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Club is due to open in early June.</PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Region is investigating a request from WTC for an additional guarantee of a $300,000 bank loan from the National Australia Bank to allow the purchase of 47 second-hand gaming machines and ancillary equipment from the City Club. This request was received on 4 May 1988. The Region's submission is expected within a week once financial information is provided from Price Waterhouse.</PARA>
<PARA> At Meeting No. 56 (10 May 1988) Commissioners approved that a decision on the WTC's application for an additional loan guarantee be made by the General Manager under Delegation, after consultation with the Chairman. The General Manager has advised the new Board of this proposal and requested their advice as to whether they wish to endorse this course of action or, if they wish, a submission will be presented to the June meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will note that until the meeting of ADC commissioners held on 10 to 14 October the amount of $300,000 was to be in the form of a bank loan. It was not until the commissioners' meeting was held on 10 to 14 October that the decision was made to approve provision of a grant of $300,000. The Minister's position on that issue became clear when, as Minister, he had drawn to his attention-as a result of evidence to Senate Estimates Committee E-the fact that there were attempts to transfer a loan arrangement into a grant for the purpose of purchasing poker machines. The Minister's position-which he has stated categorically in Parliament-is that he is totally opposed to the club being given grant moneys. To quote the Minister, `I would not give a poker machine club one cent of public money'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going to talk about the absence of Senator Reynolds from the debate in a moment or two. The refusal of Senator Reynolds to come in here and defend the status of women must set a precedent. But Senator Reynolds is in a particularly difficult position concerning this debate. This urgency motion is all about the hypocrisy of this Government-a government which runs a massive propaganda machine claiming its dedication to improving the status of women. Yet when it comes to the test it condones the demeaning of women through its support for the Australian Capital Territory pornographic video industry, support which it reiterated yesterday. If one is to believe the press there is only one member of the Australian Labor Party, the much beleaguered Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), who was prepared to get up and put the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate is about a government which will spend tens of thousands of dollars on educating the advertising industry away from sexist portrayals of women and sexual stereotyping yet allows the ACT its jurisdiction-the jurisdiction under its control-to become the pornographic headquarters of Australia with the portrayal and exploitation of women in this most offensive and degrading way. I would suggest-and I am pleased that you are in the chair, Madam Acting Deputy President, and can listen to this debate-that such double standards defy description. It makes a mockery of the Government's claimed support for improving the status of women. It reduces to a farce the operation of a body such as the Office of the Status of Women. This is an office which is not allowed to express an independent point of view-an office which is bound to government policy. In this instance it is government policy to accept the degradation and exploitation of women in this most offensive way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button might think that I am going overboard. He accepts the degradation of women. Why did he not get up in the Caucus meeting yesterday and express the counter view? Why did he not express the view of his Attorney-General? He should join with the view that has been expressed by every State Attorney-General around Australia and personally held by the Federal Attorney-General. I remind Senator Button of the resolution in Darwin on 30 June 1988 when the State Attorneys-General unanimously said to the Commonwealth, `We want you to ban X-rated videos not only because of the damage they are doing by demeaning women in the ACT but also, through the mail order business that is run out of the Territory, the damage it is doing throughout Australia'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that someone in your Caucus debate yesterday, Madam Acting Deputy President, said that this is the one government which is out of step on this matter in Australia. It is the one government that holds such a critical position because out of the Australian Capital Territory a mail order operation can run and this degradation of women can therefore spread throughout the Commonwealth. Why is the Government not prepared to act in a way consistent with that requested by Attorneys-General from around Australia? I say with some regret that it seems to boil down to the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to women. You might smirk, Madam Acting Deputy President, but I say that with particular regret because the Office of the Status of Women is located in the Prime Minister's office. Senator Reynolds comes in here and says that it is located in the Prime Minister's office because of his deep concern for the status of women in this country. The Prime Minister was not even at the Caucus meeting yesterday when this was done. When he was asked questions about it he responded in an offensive way. But this is what one might expect from this Prime Minister. The Office of the Status of Women is within his Department on the basis that it is supposed to add prestige and strength to the office. But when it comes to the crunch the Prime Minister adds no support for improving the status of women in this country. I wonder that the attitude of the dedicated women who work in that Office is to the realisation that they are but pawns in the Government's game, and that they are used to create a false image. I regard it as very sad. It leads me to the contribution, or non-contribution, of Senator Reynolds in this critically important subject-Senator Reynolds, who is not in the chamber and who refuses to promote the status of women or to put her position or to defend the Government's position or whatever she might want to do in this debate. Yesterday I asked Senator Reynolds:</PARA>
<PARA> What is more demeaning to women than the X-rated video industry which thrives in this city with the legislative support of her Government? How can she advocate improvement in the status of women when her Government condones the exploitation of women in this way? When the Government sets such a poor example in matters within its control, how can it expect different standards from others?</PARA>
<PARA>In response to that question, Senator Reynolds said:</PARA>
<PARA> The important thing to realise when one is standing up for the recognition of the status of women is what women regard as important in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is totally meaningless. Senator Reynolds continued:</PARA>
<PARA> What women regard as important in the private arena, that is, in the privacy of their own homes and in their relationship with their partners, is entirely a matter for those women. </PARA>
<PARA>But we are not talking about what women regard as important in the privacy of their own homes. We are talking of how women are demeaned and exploited by this industry, and how this Government condones that exploitation. Surely Senator Reynolds can see that. One can only presume that she is embarrassed by the Government's position and is not prepared to stand up and support it. I hope that is so, because I have thought in the past that she was genuinely trying to improve the status of women; but I very much regret that she has not had the courage to come in here today and say that that is her goal and that she will stand up against the Government. Certainly one could not say that yesterday's question took Senator Reynolds by surprise, because a similar question was asked by Senator Vanstone almost six months ago. Her answer then was that she would take the matter on notice. That was a simple, straightforward question on the exploitation of women in the Australian Capital Territory through the X-rated video industry, and six months ago Senator Reynolds said that she would need to take the matter on notice. She has been thinking about an answer all that time, and we still have not got it. It is in the too-hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA> I say with regret how disappointed I am, as I think women throughout Australia are, that Senator Reynolds is not prepared to stand up on their behalf in this issue. She is not prepared even to participate in this debate, to try to explain the Government's position, or, if she cannot do that, get up and say that she regrets that the Government has made a mistake. That is particularly disappointing, but perhaps what is more important beyond that is that it indicates to the women of Australia just how effective Senator Reynolds is in this area. She has no influence at all on the Prime Minister or on Caucus. If we are to believe the press, she did not even open her mouth in the debate yesterday to defend the position of Australian women. If that is the case-and one can only presume that is so from her refusal to participate in the debate today-that is a great disappointment. If she is not prepared to stand up for women, why does she not acknowledge that she has not that influence and perhaps resign?</PARA>

<PARA> It is a matter of great regret that the Government left its Attorney-General like a shag on a rock yesterday-the only person who was prepared to stand up in the Caucus room and defend the status of women. Why did not the Government, which says that it is so influenced by the union movement, take some notice of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association? It was probably because 75 per cent of members of that association are women. They lobbied this Government against this industry because their members were so offended by it. But no, the Government did not want to take any notice of that because Senator Collins was so persuasive in debate. We look forward to his contribution in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only will we find out the attitude of women to this matter, but we will pursue this topic in a private member's Bill. We hope that it will be treated by this chamber with greater respect than was the Bill that was sought to be introduced by the Opposition in the House of Representatives yesterday. When Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, sought to introduce a Bill in terms that a ban be placed on the sale and distribution of X-rated videos and for related purposes, the Government gagged him. That gag was moved by Mr Beazley, the Minister for Defence. When Mr Neil Brown, the honourable member for Menzies, stood up to second the motion, again the Government moved the gag. The Government would not let the Opposition express one word on this subject. That is the way in which this Government operates in the House of Representatives; but it will not work in this chamber. We will bring forward a Bill; we will have this matter debated. We will debate it month in and month out. This Government will respond in the end and will do so before the next election. It knows that women are offended by this subject matter and knows that it is letting the women of Australia down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the urgency motion is in two parts. Firstly, it refers to the need to implement the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys-General and then it goes on to talk about the Government's attitude towards women as exemplified by this issue as compared with advertising. Because of the confusion in the community about what is actually contained in the X-rated classification, I will deal with that part of the motion before coming to the more particular question of a supposed link between X-rated videos and the exploitation of women. At least I think that is what the Opposition is claiming in its motion: the wording is rather confused. I do not know what is meant by the expression `exploitation of women in the ACT pornographic video industry'. To me those words imply that women in the Australian Capital Territory are acting in pornographic videos. I prefer to use the words `explicit sex' or `erotica' because the word `pornographic' is so imprecise and value laden. To my knowledge, the only Australian X-rated film was made years ago and it was not made in Canberra. So I infer that what the motion's framers really meant is that ACT women are in some way exploited by the existence of an industry which hires and sells X-rated videos. I will return to that issue later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It cannot be stated too strongly that the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys-General in June was based on a lack of knowledge of what is shown in X-rated videos. They are not alone in their ignorance. It is widespread in the community and has been fostered by some people who know better. We have heard from one of them today. I understand that the concern at the Attorneys-General meeting was about violence. X-rated videos are non-violent. I read from the Film Censorship Board's guidelines defining X or extra restricted material:</PARA>
<PARA>Material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but does not include any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why the Joint Select Committee on Video Material recommended that it be renamed non-violent erotica. That is a far more useful way of describing it in terms that people can understand. The most violent video material which is legally available in this country is that which is classified R. Yet before and after the Attorneys-General meeting we read of interviews with State Ministers-regrettably, of all political parties-who clearly had been wrongly advised and/or had not done their homework because they thought that they had, by recommending the non-availability of X, done something significant to prevent violence. Going by recent statements, many still hold that view. I fear it is because it is easier to look for a single scapegoat, even as in this case an irrelevant one, than to look at matters such as gun laws or the need to provide greater resources to deal with domestic violence. At least one State Attorney-General claimed that the meeting had been responsible for enabling previous classifications to be reviewed by the Film Censorship Board. In fact, that was a recommendation of our Joint Select Committee and the Film Censorship Board, both of which were made before the meeting of Attorneys-General took place. </PARA>
<PARA> The then shadow spokesman for the Opposition, Peter Reith, probably contributed to the confusion when he put out a press release earlier this year calling for the banning of material which was already banned, such as depictions of explicit sexual violence. If the Opposition spokesperson was so confused-maybe that is why he is no longer the spokesperson-it is no wonder that his State colleagues were also confused, as were, regrettably, some of my State colleagues. However, the press must also take some of the responsibility for the confusion. Some journalists who rang me after this week's Caucus decision clearly believed that X-rated material contained violence. The difference between them and some top level decision makers is that they were prepared to learn. An example of this confusion was published in the Age newspaper of 15 August-to the credit of the Age it was later corrected-under the headline `43% want X rated videos banned, opinion poll shows'. The question asked in the poll was:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been some discussion recently about X rated video cassettes. Some people say that videos depicting explicit sex or violence should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA>It then went on to ask specifically what should be banned and it produced a very contradictory result-that, 43 per cent wanted X banned but only 3 per cent thought that explicit sex should be banned; in other words, the real contents of X. In view of this urgency motion, it is interesting to note that only 3 per cent of women thought that explicit sex should be banned in videos. In other words, 3 per cent thought that real X-rated videos should be banned and the other 40 per cent were confused by the incorrect information in the question. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion alleges hypocrisy on the part of the Government. If there is any hypocrisy in this whole debate it is not in the area referred to in the motion; it lies with people who act in ignorance-I believe, in some cases, wilful ignorance-to trample on the rights of Australian adults to view material when no harm can be demonstrated to result from such viewing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the motion deals with women. I note that Senator Hill did not say a great deal about it. This Government's commitment to improving the status of women in Australian society is by no means confined to criticising the advertising industry for its portrayal of women. That is a small, although important, part of our commitment. The Opposition's allegation comes very strangely-one could say hypocritically-when we remember its stance, with a few notable exceptions, on our sex discrimination and affirmative action legislation. This Government has done infinitely more in the last 5 1/2 years to advance the status of women than all the conservative governments have done since Federation, and Australian women know that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a feminist-in fact, I was one probably before I had even heard of the word-and I reject strongly the allegation that X-rated videos degrade women. With a few exceptions, the women who have written to me and those who appeared before the Joint Select Committee shared that view. The ones who put forward the view that X-rated videos are degrading to women are, on the whole, the ones at the extreme conservative end of the spectrum-bodies such as the Women's Action Alliance. This is because non-violent erotica, which is what the X-rating contains, does not exploit or degrade women any more than it does men. Some mention has been made of the Office of the Status of Women and I quote from what it said when it appeared before our Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office is satisfied that the guidelines as they now stand-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the present guidelines-</PARA>
<PARA>will operate in such a way as to prohibit such material as is likely to cause direct or indirect physical or psychological harm to women, while maintaining the rights of individuals to develop their own view of life, without direction from the state or the majority. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to a question about X-rated material it said:</PARA>
<PARA>By saying that we do not object to that material we are not saying necessarily that we would like to see it encouraged in any way. We said in our submission that a fine balance exists. Where we on examination of the guidelines have drawn the line in that balance is in the area of gratuitous violence and cruelty that are covered by the new guidelines. That is not to say that we are very pleased about that sort of material. In fact, there is a lot of non-pornographic material in the media generally which depicts women as subordinate or in exploited situations that we are not happy with. </PARA>
<PARA>The Office went on to talk about advertising. I understand that my colleague Senator Crowley is going to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In many X-rated films it is in fact the women who take the initiative in sexual activity. Perhaps it is this that some people are objecting to. Perhaps it is really that some people object to the portrayal of women as enjoying sex. The social conservatives on the Joint Select Committee implied that view and even gave examples such as fellatio and cunnilingus as activities to which women are subjected. It amazes me that they believe that no woman would enjoy these activities as they apparently believe, against the evidence here in the Australian Capital Territory, that all X-rated videos are bought and hired by men. In fact, 30 per cent of the hirers are women and 70 per cent of the total hirers are couples. </PARA>
<PARA> That group of conservatives on the Committee also attacked X-rated material on the grounds that it contains little plot or character development. They said that it appealed only to a `prurient interest in sexual matters'. On those grounds we would need to ban vast quantities of material presently sold in bookshops and newsagents, including some weekly and, particularly, Sunday newspapers and quite a lot of advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that Senator Harradine is now in the chamber and is to speak later in the debate. He will no doubt tell us that the viewing of explicit sex has been shown to be harmful. I have read and heard the same evidence as he has, probably more critically in a methodological sense because I am a psychologist by trade. I have found no evidence that harm results in the absence of other pathology. We do not usually base legislation on what deviants or psychotics might do in response to certain stimuli. </PARA>
<PARA> One allegation that we heard on the Committee-and this was anecdotal, as much of the evidence was-was that there is a link between domestic violence and X-rated videos. I recently attended a three-day conference on domestic violence which was attended by a wide range of service providers, including psychologists, doctors, police, judges and victims of domestic violence. Videos got one mention during those three days, and that was in regard to a banned video. Surely, if there were some evidence of such a link, it would have surfaced at a conference such as this. However, firearms and other weapons did get frequent mention at the conference. Yet Senator Julian McGauran, in a recent interview on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, said that pornographic videos in the home were much more dangerous than guns. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to receive this morning a copy of a letter sent to a video industry representative by a body called the Conservative Action and Victory Fund, which describes itself as `an independent parliamentary lobby supporting conservative candidates and causes'. Its letter includes these points:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Conservative Action and Victory Fund is totally opposed to the imposition of any censorship on literature or viewing material-in addition to any attempt by government to decrease the ordinary rights of law abiding Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. As such, it is the consideration of CAVF that the Industry should not be subject to any government action, and that any public concern should be dealt with internally by self-regulation and examination. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Irrespective of the success or otherwise of current national proposals, it is the intention of CAVF to pursue with the next federal government-i.e. a Howard-led federal Coalition-</PARA>
<PARA>that shows its politics-</PARA>
<PARA>the reversal of impending legislation with a view to putting in place point No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the right of self-regulation and internal censorship. I trust that the Opposition will take note of this body, which clearly supports conservative candidates and causes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter about which people have very deep, often emotional and, for the most part, sincere feelings. In the time available I shall attempt to deal with all aspects of Senator Hill's urgency motion. The deep and personal feelings are there because the matter that we are debating formally in this place deals with an aspect of our human lives that affects us all most personally-that is, our sexuality and our sexual behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our so-called civilised society, what is said and what is done as far as sexual matters are concerned are often in conflict with each other. I can take an example from a recent era in our history. In the Victorian era piano legs were covered so that ladies' sensitivities could be protected. But at the same time, upper-class brothels and prostitutes flourished for the convenience of those same gentlemen who were so eager to protect the sensitivities of their ladies at home by covering piano legs and table legs and so on. But what about the women in the lower classes in the Victorian era who could not claim to be ladies and who, therefore, were not allowed their sensitivities? These women's status was somewhat different. They often had to carry out hard physical work and if, by some misfortune, a woman in service became pregnant to the master of the house, this would usually result in an instant shamed dismissal. So much for the status of women in Victorian times. But at least piano legs were covered!</PARA>
<PARA> What of the status of women today? Matters have improved. Some women now have the choice between home duties and a career. Some women are in a position to have a career and to afford a support system for child, husband and home care. Some women, despite equal opportunity legislation and despite affirmative action in some areas, are still subject to exploitation, which is the matter under debate today. The women in our community who continue to be the most exploited are Aboriginal women and women of migrant backgrounds. This has nothing to do with X-rated or any other sort of videos, because their exploitation dates back to long before video recorders and even before television itself. Aboriginal women, like their menfolk, have had the legal status of citizens for only just over 20 years. Migrant women continue to be exploited daily in low paid, boring and unpleasant jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to the issue of the portrayal of women in the advertising industry before I return to the matter of X-rated video classification, which is the main thrust of the motion moved by Senator Hill, presumably on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia. In her speech opening the public forum on women and advertising, Senator Margaret Reynolds, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, described how the Federal Government became aware of the extent of women's dissatisfaction with the way they are portrayed in the media, particularly in advertising. She said that 28 per cent of the 25,000 women who outlined their concerns and priorities to the Government cited the way they were portrayed in the media as a major issue. She said that they complained of sex role stereotyping of women in advertising as being a major concern to a large proportion of women. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reynolds said that some research had been carried out in that area. She said that the first stage consisted of a comprehensive and unique content analysis of 901 different advertisements from all media and that this showed an overwhelming use of male presenters and voice-overs; a concentration of women in domestic duties and nurturing roles, `a marked under-representation of Aboriginal, non-English speaking, older and disabled women, to the extent of their invisibility', and a certain usage of irrelevant sexual portrayal and innuendo to promote products. She went on to say that the second stage of the research was in-depth consultations with 407 women to gauge their reactions to a representative sample of advertisements. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>The results show that women firmly believe that advertising acts against their achievement of equality. They object strongly to being shown as submissive, sexually available, cute, dim-witted and frivolous. They are concerned that their portrayal reinforces social stereotypes-an overemphasis on physical appearance, being slaves to their homes and families, being superwomen able to pursue full-time jobs, family responsibilities and home duties. They are concerned at the effect of constantly reinforced stereotypes on their children's behaviour and expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> A further random telephone survey of 1,002 women reinforces these findings, with between 54 and 68 per cent thinking that women were too often shown as young, slim and good looking, as valued for sex, as silly, incompetent and childish and as seldom able to provide expert advice. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the matter of advertising. I believe that this matter is being addressed in conjunction with the advertising industry. I dispute the coalition Opposition's thesis implied in this motion that the Government is merely claiming a commitment to improving the status of women. I am sure that the Liberal Party and the National Party believe that they can do much better. No doubt at some stage in the future we will have an opportunity to judge that for ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of X-rated videos and that portion of the Opposition's motion which says that there is a `need to implement the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys-General in Darwin of 30 June 1988 that the X-rated video classification should be discontinued'. First and foremost, what are X-rated videos? As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material I can inform honourable senators that they are boring, repetitive and of no artistic merit. I would like to see them banned on the last proviso, that is, that they lack artistic merit. But that precedent could result in much being banned in our culture, so it is unlikely to happen on that ground. The definition of X-rated videos is that they are restricted to people 18 years and over and they have:</PARA>
<PARA>Material which includes explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, but does not include any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Depictions that are refused classification and are banned are those of child pornography and bestiality, and `detailed and gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty; explicit or gratuitous depictions of sexual violence against non-consenting persons'. This category also includes terrorist-type weapons and acts, and the abuse of hard drugs. The definition of R-rated videos, which are also restricted to those 18 years of age and over, includes:</PARA>
<PARA>Adult material which is considered likely to be possibly harmful to those under 18 years and possibly offensive to some sections of the adult community.</PARA>
<PARA>The language may be `sexually explicit and/or assaultive'. As far as sex is concerned, it may be:</PARA>
<PARA>Implied, obscured or simulated depictions of sexual activity; depictions of sexual violence only to the extent that they are discreet, not gratuitous and not exploitative. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as violence is concerned, it may be:</PARA>
<PARA>Explicit depictions of violence, but not detailed and gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that, if any grade of videos is to be banned, I personally would put the R before the X, because not only can R-rated videos contain sexual depictions, but they can be violent depictions. There is a most unfortunate misconception in the community that X-rated videos contain violent depictions of sex. This is simply not so-at least not in Australia. It can be so in the United Kingdom and the United States of America; hence, I think, the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the majority of the Committee decided that a better name for X-rated videos would be non-violent erotica (NVE), because that is descriptive. Whether this should or should not be banned is a matter on which public opinion is divided, because in essence the public debate is censorship versus explicit sexual material on the screen. I do not believe that public opinion is divided on whether it should be restricted. In fact, the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material was that both X and R-rated videos should be severely restricted to those 18 years and over; that the videos should be viewed in a separate room from other video classifications, or in a folder if a separate room is not available; and that no promotional material should be visible in public places. I hope that it would also include newspaper advertising, some of which is most offensive. People sometimes find their privacy invaded in that way. I agree that it is simply one of our human rights that we should not have to view material of any sort, including promotional material, that we do not wish to view. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the decisions of the Attorneys-General made earlier this year. In brief, those decisions were: that X-rated videos should be banned, that films and videos close to the top of the R category should be banned, that films and videos currently close to the top of the M category should become R, and that video packaging should contain more information about the contents. In other words, the recommendation for the banning of X-rated videos was one of a whole selection of conclusions that were arrived at. The current situation is that the sale and hire of X-rated videos is banned in all States of Australia. These were decisions taken by the various State governments. However, the possession of X-rated videos is not banned in any State. The sale and hire of X-rated video materials is currently allowed in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. However, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has legislated to restrict the availability of both X and R-rated videos, much on the lines of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee about which I spoke earlier. When the Australian Capital Territory Assembly comes into being-I hope, early next year-it will be interesting to see how the elected representatives of the people of the Australian Capital Territory will legislate on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Australian Labor Party Caucus quite correctly, to my way of thinking, opted to obtain more information before addressing the matter further. I quote from its resolution:</PARA>
<PARA> Caucus is concerned about the ongoing confusion over the contents of X and R-rated videos in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, Caucus determines that a working party be formed to resolve this confusion and to examine means by which a reduction in the level of violence in all categories of publicly available video, especially in the R-rated category, will be brought about. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the matters that Caucus will consider. I ask this question publicly: When Caucus debates these matters, will it consider the research work done by the Australian Institute of Criminology over the last two years, which has revealed, firstly:</PARA>
<PARA>those who watch X-rated videos, besides being predominantly male-</PARA>
<PARA>that is about 60 per cent or so-</PARA>
<PARA>represent, in other social and demographic characteristics, a cross-section of all video viewers;</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA>that our society is far more accepting of filmed aggression and violence than it is of consenting adult sexual activity and the community appears willing to expose its young to large amounts of filmed violence;</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA>that there is no evidence that sexually explicit media material leads to an increase in crime generally or sex crimes specifically. </PARA>
<PARA>Other matters have been brought forward by the Institute of Criminology, and I certainly recommend that Caucus debate those also. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not claim to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats, of my parliamentary colleagues or of all women. However, I do claim to represent a rational and valid viewpoint which I know is supported by a section of the community. The Australian Democrats have a conscience vote on every issue, and therefore they most certainly will have a conscience vote on this issue. I believe that all parliamentarians should have a conscience vote on more issues than they already do, and on this issue in particular. I personally find the coalition Opposition's motion self-righteous and hypocritical and I will be voting against it. </PARA>
<PARA> For perhaps a last word on hypocrisy, I refer honourable senators to an article in the Melbourne Age earlier this year headed `The tragedy that is a national disgrace', which states:</PARA>
<PARA>My sister came to stay with me for a while. She went down the street to get some milk and came back in tears because of what she had seen out there-girls of 13 and 14 prostituting themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>It suddenly struck me that it was outrageous in a wealthy society like this that we are allowing kids to be exploited and abused in very large numbers. The degree is comparable with Dickensian England. </PARA>
<PARA>That, Madam Acting Deputy President, is exploitation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly am happy to be able to speak on this matter of urgency today. As a mother and a grandmother, any issues which affect women and families rate the highest priority with me. My colleague Senator Hill has raised the matter of urgency, which should be of the greatest concern to women and families throughout Australia, and I believe that he has done it very well. The Senate should support this matter of urgency, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need to implement the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys-General in Darwin on 30 June 1988 that the X-rated video classification should be discontinued and to thereby end the hypocrisy of the Government in claiming a commitment to improving the status of women in Australian society exemplified by their giving priority to criticising the advertising industry for their portrayal of women while declining to take legislative measures to eliminate the exploitation of women in the ACT pornographic video industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The recent decision by the Labor Caucus to defeat Mr Bowen's proposal to ban X-rated videos is a blow for women and families, not only in Canberra but throughout Australia. This Government has made a sham of its promises to upgrade the status of women. It has made a sham of looking after families. It has given to yet another minority-the pedlars of pornography-an industry which makes money out of exploiting women and caters to the more perverse elements in society. This Government will rue the day that it backtracked on this issue, which has rightly been interpreted as a slap in the face for the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest union in Australia, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), had called for a ban on X-rated material and their equivalents. It urged the Government to make regulations to prevent such material from being sent from Canberra by post. The Labour Council of New South Wales has also expressed support for this action. The Caucus decision to set up a working party to resolve the confusions about the contents of X-rated and R-rated videos is a weak excuse. As the SDA official said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Union is fully aware of the nature and content of videos which bear the `X' classification. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it has been suggested to me that our capital city should be renamed Pornberra instead of Canberra and marked on the map with an X. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Brisbane is a very fine city. That has been exemplified by the recent World Expo 88, and everybody thinks it is a very fine place. But we are not talking about Brisbane; we are talking about Canberra. We have a spectacular new Parliament House in which to work for the interests of Australians. Yet how ironic and even sad it is that our capital city should also be the porn centre of Australia. The Adult Video Industry Association sent a nauseous information sheet around to parliamentarians. It says that there are probably more X-rated video watchers in a State or electorate than churchgoers. I strongly dispute that. If this is the calibre of the people to whom the Labor Party is listening, it will not be in office much longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A newspaper poll held in July this year found that 45 per cent of Australians favour a ban on all X-rated videos; 34 per cent favour allowing only non-violent erotic videos; and only 15 per cent favour allowing all X-rated videos. In another poll in August there was a massive 43 per cent in favour of a total ban on all X-rated videos, as opposed to the 24 per cent of respondents who were against any type of ban. We can conclude from those polls that a substantial number of people favour some form of restriction on videos containing violent material. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which is particularly important in this issue is the control of access to viewing videos. While one can have some form of control in cinemas, control of access to television and video viewing is impossible. Governments have a responsibility to protect minors from seeing material of a violent or sexual nature that would disturb them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Zakharov that parents have a responsibility but, regrettably, they are not always there to exercise control over television or video viewing. This Government has often said that it is concerned about child abuse and child poverty. But talking about it is not enough. It is up to the Government to exercise control to protect children from the psychological dangers of this type of video material. The only way this can be done is at the point of sale or hire. It is impossible to control access to X- and R-rated videos. They can be hired by someone over 18 and given to children or ordered by children through the mail. That is a very sad state of affairs. In my opinion, the only answer is not to allow anything to be sold or hired from a video shop which could not be shown on television, although that leaves a pretty wide scope, from what one sees on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very concerned that many young people watching explicit sexual material as well as violent material may come to think that such behaviour is acceptable. They might think that because they have seen it on video it cannot be all that bad. I have stood up for the family many times in this place but I do not think that I have ever been more worried about the future of families in Australia than I am at this very moment. Families are the cornerstone of society. They form the basic structure around which we all build our lives. In order to maintain our way of life, health, safety and order, we must protect the interests of the family. The record of this Government in looking after families is most regrettable. I remind the Senate that in 1983 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave an undertaking in Parliament to act in the best interests of families. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely nothing that this Government will do which will in any way prejudice women who appropriately make that choice. </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about women who saw their role as wives and mothers. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the range of policies that will be adopted by my Government will ensure that families and women discharging that role will be given the greatest opportunity of achieving fulfilment and satisfaction for them and those dependent upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>These are noble ideals, but the reality is that time and time again this Government has implemented policies which serve only to break down the family unit. The family has suffered severely by the continual decline in living standards over the last five years. The average worker and his family are being discriminated against, while Labor woos big business and panders to the whims of vocal and radical minority groups in order to stay in office. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk about the cost of buying a home under this present Government. I could talk about the fact that over 40,000 Australians are permanently homeless, with another 60,000 living on the verge of homelessness. It is no wonder that this Government should add to its record of ignoring the interests of families by allowing an X-rated video industry to flourish. It is also not surprising that this Government discriminates against the children of rural families by imposing assets tests which restrict their right to an education. The whole economic system in this country under the present Labor Government is geared towards breaking down the family rather than helping the family to maintain its position as the strength of this country. Not only has the family undergone economic and social hardship but now this Government is attempting to undermine it morally. Standards within the family have to be fostered and protected. Standards in the entertainment habits of the young must also be nurtured. Their mental and emotional health must be protected if Australia is to have a strong and vigorous future. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I received a very moving letter-I think perhaps most of the honourable senators received this letter-from the parents of Janine Balding, the young woman who was so brutally assaulted and murdered by a gang of street kids in Sydney. In the letter they ask:</PARA>
<PARA>What would you do if it was your daughter or loved one?</PARA>
<PARA>They say that the lack of discipline and respect for the rights of others has deteriorated to a serious extent. In addition, they state that the sale of X-rated video films should be banned. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Young people with nothing better to do, and many without home discipline have access to such filth and mind corrupting influences through having access to home videos. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is a very sad state of affairs indeed. I felt that it was very appropriate to the debate that we were having today. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my contribution on this matter of urgency by relating an everyday occurrence which happened to a friend of mine in Canberra. My friend's teenage sons went to an end of year party at the home of a very reputable family. The parents had gone out to leave the 16-year-olds to their loud music and their fairly noisy activities. Towards the end of the evening, one of the teenagers produced an X-rated movie and suggested that they all watch it on the family video player. This created an embarrassing situation for the party and especially for my friend's sons. Most of the teenagers were eager to watch the movie. I think that probably few of them had, ever seen one, and they were curious. My friend's sons and a couple of other teenagers were placed in an acutely embarrassing situation. They did not want to watch the movie and they did not want to spoil the party, but in the end they were forced to ring up their own parents and ask them to come and pick them up. If X-rated movies were not readily available in Canberra, this situation would never have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very angry that teenagers should be exposed to this kind of situation. I feel angry for my friend who expected that her sons would enjoy a relaxed party with their friends. I feel angry for the parents who left the house expecting that the teenagers would have an enjoyable party with noisy music and a lot of fun. An X-rated video spoiled the party, spoiled the trust of parents, and created an embarrassing and difficult situation. This Government will stand condemned for its weak-kneed decision on X-rated videos. It is no good for women, it is no good for families, it is no good for Canberra, no good for Australia and, indeed, I believe no good for voters. </PARA>

I remember seeing a program, the Goodies-a brilliant program, in fact, satirising people like the ones opposite-which was entitled, `How to make babies by doing dirty things in beds'. Woody Allen satirised the same attitudes expressed opposite. It was a great movie. When he was being asked by a psychiatrist, `Do you think sex is dirty?', he replied, `Only if you do it right'. That is the wink, wink, nudge, nudge school of sex that is totally irrelevant in the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I said by way of interjection, Senator Hill's little `l' is getting bigger every day, and noticeably bigger-and after the recent emasculation of Senator Puplick by Senator Bishop, who could blame him?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about non-violent erotica, Senator. That is what some of us on this side of the House want to see permitted for those people who want to watch it. Primitive erotica has been around for a very long time-in all of the stone ages, neolithic, megalithic, and a profusion of erotic art in the paleolithic age, which interests me particularly for a reason I will tell the Senate about in a minute. The erotic primitive cave art belonging to some of my constituents in the Northern Territory contains examples of the finest primitive erotica in the world. The work carried out by two of the most famous of Australia's anthropologists, R. M. and C. H. Berndts, both of whom I have the privilege to know personally, documents some of the erotic art of the Oenpelli, Goulburn Island, and Liverpool River area of Arnhem Land. There are a series of sexual rock paintings near Oenpelli which were used for sexual magic, such as the procuring of lovers in years past. The paintings which are done in ochres and blood depict, to quote the Berndts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Women with human, bird or reptile heads, severed arms, accentuated breasts and elongated vulvae streaming with semen; women with babes suckling at their breasts, bodies of women showing in X-ray style, foetal growth, women dancing and men and women carrying out the sexual act. </PARA>
<PARA>I should not have to go on to talk about Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, The Decameron, the Kama Sutra, or the erotic art of Greece and Rome, India, China, Japan and South East Asia.

I watched Debbie Does Dallas when I was on the Joint Select Committee on Video Material and it did not do a thing for me. Of course, the fact that I was locked up in a dark room with Senator Walters may have had something to do with that. The absolutely rife confusion about what is contained in X-rated videos continues and it was responsible for that resolution being carried yesterday. What I said at the beginning of that contribution was this: if the working party should determine that there are strong and valid political reasons-as a practising politician now for 12 years I have no embarrassment in saying that keeping in government is important-then I am happy to accept a decision that perhaps these videos should be banned. More honest than this I cannot be. I then went on to say: `However, be honest about banning them on political grounds; do not try to ban them on nonsensical grounds that there is proven evidence that they do harm, because there is not'. I cannot be more honest than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen had the hide to pontificate about standards and morality and family values in Queensland. Anybody who has been reading the transcripts of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, detailing the pornography, prostitution and corruption under 20 years of administration by Premier Bjelke-Petersen would have to say `Hypocrites!' again. Senator Bjelke-Petersen also talked about the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) position on this issue. I will tell her what it is by quoting from the Sunday Telegraph of 30 October. The Secretary of the SDA is reported as saying that he wanted these X-rated videos taken off the shelves because he:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . believes the sexually explicit and violent X-rated videos degrade women and encourage sexual harassment. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to be even more specific when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If you continue to allow the circulation of these videos showing women being raped and even enjoying being raped, it is going to affect the way that some people treat women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine may be interested to know that X is the only category of video on the market today that does not contain any violence at all. G contains violence; PG contains violence; M contains violence; R contains horrific and appalling violence. It is easy to understand that misunderstanding. Because people are used to seeing the appalling, horrific, gut churning violence that is freely available in R-rated videos on the shelves, they assume, not surprisingly, that X being a category beyond R has to contain sexual violence which is even worse. The fact is that the kind of violence that degraded women was completely removed from that category in 1984. X is the only category that contains no violence whatsoever. If honourable senators do not want their children to see explicit sex, I can sympathise with that. Neither do I want my children to see it until I think they are ready. However, honourable senators seem quite happy to let them see the mindless violence that is so readily available not just in the R category but in the M category as well; films such as Robbo Cop which I could not believe when my son brought that video home. I would not let him watch it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is certainly a lot of hypocrisy attached to this argument. We get to the question of degrading women. One can assume that non-violent erotica degrades women only if one is still in the Dark Ages when women always played a passive role in their sexual relationships, rather than an active role. They used to do so then and, of course, many women today still accept that role. It is not the role I see women playing in a healthy sexual relationship. Consensual, non-coercive, non-violent sex should have men and women as equal partners. Therefore, if women are degraded by X-rated videos, as a former female chief censor said not so long ago, so equally are men. It is a nonsensical argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I will talk about children in the few minutes I have remaining. Like most senators, I think that that is the issue in respect of these videos that concerns us most. The main responsibility for looking after children does not rest with this Parliament. It does not rest with Caucus committees. It rests fairly and squarely with the parents of children. I will repeat the analogy I gave in the Caucus yesterday, because it is an exact analogy, when I referred to swimming pool fences. I was a divisional officer in the St John Ambulance in Darwin for eight years. Personally I fished more dead kids out of swimming pools than I care to think about. All the time, for the eight years, I was fishing dead kids out of swimming pools there were no regulations providing for swimming pool fences in Darwin. It was an extraordinary situation. Subsequently, as a member of parliament I campaigned vigorously to have that legislation introduced. It was. The number of deaths dropped dramatically. However, we still had deaths in swimming pools. Why? After parents are compelled to pay $2,000 or $3,000 to put a swimming pool fence up, some parents still leave the gate open. We cannot legislate for people such as that; no parliament can. The ultimate responsibility rests with the parents. It is a cop-out. It always is a cop-out to say that Parliament will do something for one on one's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to something that Senator Jenkins said that touched me. Let us talk about deviants. We cannot legislate to impose conditions on the whole of Australian society based on society's lowest common denominator. Let us talk about the deviants, the paedophiles who are around. There are thousands of them. They do not need X-rated videos. At a recent seminar in Sydney a social worker gave evidence to a censorship debate on paedophiles in Sydney. He said that there were thousands of paedophiles; upper middle class affluent paedophiles. These are the same paedophiles that infiltrated only recently-it was a great tragedy-an overseas charitable agency that looked after children. They infiltrated that agency for the purpose of procuring children for sex. That was disgraceful. It was disgusting. What did they do? They used their money to infiltrate. What is the greatest corrupter of children by paedophiles and deviants? It is not X-rated videos; it is money. What are honourable senators going to do to fix that? Are they going to ban $10 bills? It is a nonsensical argument. Senator Jenkins made the same point in regard to child prostitution. Why are children on the streets prostituting themselves? They are economically vulnerable. They are being exploited with money by people who are not so economically vulnerable. I say with conviction that if non-violent erotic porn is the only danger that my son is going to face in the world when he gets out into it, I will rest easy in my bed at night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I withdraw. I leave it to the listeners-we are on air-and the people in the gallery to make their own assessment. However, it seems very sad to me that Senator Collins did not discuss the urgency motion at all. The hypocrisy of this Government on this issue is mind-boggling. For years we have seen Senator Reynolds standing in this chamber and the whole Government putting on an act, expressing concern for women's rights. The Government has gone to the barricades on the stereotyping of women in advertising. It has only wept crocodile tears over domestic violence. We have a situation in which, at last, this Government can at least do something concrete about domestic violence; it can ban X-rated videos. What has it done? The Government has bowed to the money of the multimillion dollar lobby of the pushers of pornography. I refer to a question put by Senator Giles to Senator Reynolds last month. Senator Giles asked Senator Reynolds about the first national forum on the portrayal of women in advertising. Senator Reynolds stood in this place and said that over 600 people had attended that forum. Wonderful! She said that there had been two major outcomes. She said that, firstly, the Government would establish a task force and, secondly, it would probably have some form of media watch organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I agree that we have a problem with the stereotyping of women in advertising, for the Government to make that its priority I think is a disgrace. The priority should be domestic violence and violence against women generally. What has this Government done? There was a statement by Prime Minister Hawke in Question Time yesterday that the Government was setting up a working party to look at a reduction in the level of violence in all video categories. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a Senate select committee on this matter and we have had the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, on which the Government had the majority of members. We came to decisions about violence in all categories; we came up with a recommendation for the Government. We have had the Attorneys-General from all over Australia saying that they want X-rated videos banned and they want violence in the other categories downgraded. Yet the Government has the arrogance to stand up and say, `We know better. We know that the Attorneys-General throughout Australia haven't a clue what it is all about; they are ignorant. They do not know what it is about'. We have Senator Zakharov standing here saying, `I know better; they don't know what they are talking about. The Attorneys-General are a dumb lot and they have no knowledge'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are being told repeatedly by the Australian Labor Party that people do not understand what the X-rated videos are about. It is no wonder the Government lost the referendum, because it claimed the people of Australia did not understand the referendum either. The Government lost the referendum and resorted to saying, `We will never be able to change our Constitution because the people of Australia do not understand'. The people of Australia understand very well; they just do not trust the Government. They defeated its referendum and they will defeat the Government at the next election, because they do understand what it is on about. They understand the money behind all this-$25m in Canberra alone for exporting all this stuff to the other States because the other States do not want it. They understand what the Government is on about; they understand the money behind it and what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that there is no proof that X-rated videos create extra violence against women. We have also been told that the child pornography that is at present banned does create extra problems for children. I agree with that wholeheartedly, and I also agree wholeheartedly that the denigration of women in this filthy X-rated stuff does women immeasurable harm. We have been told by both Senator Zakharov and Senator Collins today that there is no violence; that it is just ordinary sex between men and women. What absolute bunkum. We on the Joint Select Committee have never seen any type of affection demonstrated between men and women in this rubbish that so many people are making millions out of. There has been no display of affection; just pure sex for sex's sake. Senator Collins today has said that sex is always with us. Of course it is always with us. I hope it always will be with us, and I hope that the average man and woman in Australia believe there should be affection and love associated with that action, but honourable senators opposite delight in talking about it, delight in viewing it, and believe beyond any shadow of a doubt that it ought to be a free-for-all. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Collins piously says that it is up to the parents. It would be unhealthy for parents to watch every move of their 14- 15- and 16-year-old children. They cannot stop them going to friends' homes. To stifle them in that way would be unhealthy. They have to trust their children, and I defy any parents who see that X-rated stuff to say that is what they would like their children's first impressions of sex to be. It is revolting, rubbishy stuff with no love and affection at all. Way-out homosexual sex is depicted and all sorts of stuff is shown, but the mob opposite say that is all right. It is too dirty to be shown in the films for the public, but it is all right for home entertainment-let us have it for home entertainment! That is what the mob opposite is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the figures on violence. In the past 10 years the incidence of rape has increased from 6.08 per cent per 100,000 of population to 14.51 per cent. The incidence of serious assault has increased from 24.75 per cent to 81.18 per cent. We are going to be told by Senator Crowley, who is to follow me, that one cannot take any notice of that rape figure because people now report rape whereas previously they did not. What she is going to say about the serious assault I am not quite sure, but these new figures have been standardised to make sure that they are as close as possible to the figures that applied 10 years ago. She will say we cannot take any notice of them, but we know, as does any honourable senator who has gone around the community doorknocking, as I did during the last elections, that a woman on her own in the house is very reluctant to open the door. We all know that the secure feeling that women once had is gone. The majority of women are very worried about walking the streets at night, about opening their doors. We have all sorts of places set up as secure communities because women have become concerned about their own security. This does not apply only to one type of women but to women across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence has been given to us that one cannot say that X-rated videos definitely, without any shadow of a doubt, cause extreme violence. Of course one cannot say that, nor can it be said about child pornography. But the Joint Select Committee on Video Material heard evidence from Professor Sheehan which I think is extremely valuable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the critical thing in whether or not there will be these so-called effects of sexually explicit material is how aggressive the person is in the first place . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that a lot of people are stimulated mildly or strongly by seeing sexually explicit material. When one is aroused one tends to behave as a consequence of that arousal and I think if the person is aggressive aggression will out . . . In and of itself, I do not think that sexually explicit material divorced from aggression leads to strong negative effects. Once you combine sexually explicit material with aggression you have a different kettle of fish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are addressing an urgency motion brought into this place by Senator Hill which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need to implement the unanimous recommendation of the State Attorneys-General in Darwin on 30 June 1988 that the X-rated video classification should be discontinued and to thereby end the hypocrisy of the Government in claiming a commitment to improving the status of women in Australian society exemplified by their giving priority to criticising the advertising industry for their portrayal of women while declining to take legislative measures to eliminate the exploitation of women in the ACT pornographic video industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw that to the attention of honourable senators because it would seem to me that very few people from the Opposition have even part way addressed the content of that urgency motion. I ask: What is urgent about it? The answer, of course, is absolutely nothing. This is a motion of massive blatant political expediency; no more and no less. The Opposition says, `This looks as though we have the Government in some kind of contradiction; let's belt them'. Senator Hill and other senators opposite can try that but it does not in any way make this matter any more urgent than it was the day before, last week, for the last five years or for the seven years of the Fraser Government which did so little to improve the status of women in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> Next we had a referral to the word hypocrisy. Hypocrisy was attributed to the Government. I would have thought that hypocrisy, as Senator Collins and Senator Zakharov said in this place, belongs with the Opposition. Firstly, there is the hypocrisy of Senator Hill claiming urgency when it is merely political expediency and, secondly, there is the hypocrisy of the speakers. In leading off the debate Senator Hill spent all his time addressing the absence in this place of Senator Reynolds. He had almost nothing to say about the content of his motion. He did not address why it was urgent. He did not address the definitions of video classifications. He did not address what it is that so distresses the status of women. He did not address what he means by making the Australian Capital Territory the pornographic video industry centre of Australia. He was certainly taken to the limits of glorious extravagance by Senator Bjelke-Petersen who, I think, talked about `Pornberra'. I heard it from outside the chamber and I must say that that is flying a kite and flying it fairly high. Senator Hill had nothing of any importance to contribute except to throw off at the Government because Senator Reynolds was not here in this debate. He somehow did not think it was curious that he was in the chamber and some of the women from the Opposition were not. All these points are tedious and trivial and his attack on Senator Reynolds was specious and showed how hollow his contribution was. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, he did not say that he attended the public forum on the portrayal of women in the media and advertising. He did not say that at the Saturday session when he was speaking-and there are some 600 witnesses to prove this-he said that he was opposed to censorship. At that forum Senator Robert Hill said, `I am opposed to censorship'. Is it not interesting that he forgot to tell us that that was what his view was when he was talking about the urgency of the Government banning this. Can we believe, as some people have suggested, that Senator Hill is going from small `l' to big `l' liberal very rapidly in the face of preselections in his own State? Today there is an article in the Australian Financial Review pointing out that his position on the Senate ticket is very much in jeopardy and that he will be opposed for that top position by Senator Chapman who believes that he ought to be entitled to the top spot on the ticket. He intends to fight for it on the grounds that he is in South Australia more often than is Senator Hill. I would suggest that that is very wide of the mark. I am quite surprised that this sort of rhubarb has got into the debate. Senator Puplick's case lends a certain amount of value to this point. </PARA>

<PARA> I do not believe that we can properly address anything Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen added to the debate because it was largely about euphemisms and generalisations and the amorphous family for which she said that this Government had done nothing. For the record it is important to say that this Government does have a commitment to improving the status of women in Australian society. It is a record that is unmatched by any previous government. It is certainly something that stands us in very good stead indeed. I have a small list-certainly not an exhaustive list-of some of the decisions taken by this Government. They include the introduction of the sex discrimination legislation, the affirmative action legislation and the Government's policies on the education of women and girls to a point where the number of girls retained at school to year 12 now exceeds the number of boys and where for the first time ever we have more than 50 per cent of students in tertiary institutions who are women. We have increased the number of tertiary places so that those very women can finish year 12 and if they want tertiary opportunities now they can expect to have them. </PARA>
<PARA> Under sport we have established the Women's Sport Promotion Unit, something which I have been long associated with and which talks about opportunities for women, the status of women, and the presentation and representation of women as fit, healthy, active women able to take their place in society, able to take their place on the sporting field, able to win enormous numbers of gold medals for this country and able to participate in recreation and leisure activities across the nation. The Government has promoted all of those things very actively. It has promoted its Aussie sports program to give girls, as well as boys, the opportunity to take part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The words that I am referring to here talk about the Government's claim to `a commitment to improving the status of women in Australian society'. Some of the things that I have listed go precisely to that point. It is a short litany of some of the things the Government has done to ensure that the status of women in Australian society is not a hollow commitment but an active and real one. Of over one million jobs created since this Government came into office, 68 per cent have gone to women. We have introduced a family assistance package precisely to address the needs of families with low incomes, families living on either pension income or income from low paid jobs. All of those things deal with the problem dealt with by Senator Bjelke-Petersen in terms of how this Government has or has not helped the family. Our record stands, and without doubt we are committed to assisting women and the status of women. Labor has increased the number of pensions. It has established and broadened the previous National Women's Advisory Council and extended it to the National Women's Consultative Council, increased the number of representatives, and broadened the numbers of women who have an opportunity to contribute to what government needs to know about women's attitudes and values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move to the National Agenda for Women, which was so widely circulated to women in the community and to which so many women responded. Some 7,000 of the 25,000 women who responded addressed the question as to how women are portrayed in the media. They objected to the way women are constantly portrayed in a less than dignified way, and protested at the way women are often regarded as robots in domestic areas or as sex objects. I would have been surprised if there was much difference between the women in this chamber on this matter. Certainly I object very strenuously to how women are portrayed in the media, whether stereotyped or portrayed as sex objects. Subsequent to that the Minister reminded us of the guidelines to the media called `Fair Exposure', and promised that they will be updated and reworked in case there is any need to improve them, although they were first introduced, I believe, in 1984. At the Public Forum on Women in Advertising the women listed here are to be noted as objecting to the portrayal of women in the media. I seek to table a list of women's organisations which contributed to that Public Forum. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. One sees from that list that the women who protested about the way in which the media portray women cover a whole spectrum from conservative women's organisations to radical women's organisations, and to thousands of organisations in the middle of the spectrum. All subscribe to the consensus view about how women are portrayed in the media. One of the things wrong with this urgency motion is that it does not understand the difference between the way in which women are portrayed in the media and how they are portrayed in X-rated videos. In the media women are portrayed, not invariably but in very large part, either as stereotypes or as sex objects. In the advertising or media area people who watch that material do so involuntarily. Very few people say, `Here come the advertisements-I will turn off the television or avert my eyes'. It is a very different issue from the question whether people deliberately set out to provide or procure for themselves a video by means of mail order, though in the ACT the position is not quite the same. People who seek to obtain a video of the sort that is causing so much trouble have to make a special effort to do so. In the media the difference is quite marked and remarkable. The question of how women are portrayed in the media should be properly argued because of the wide reception of such an advertising model. If the Opposition says that it needs to talk to women about this matter, I would remind Opposition senators that we have a forum. We have had the media's attention and an indication that they will reappraise the guidelines to see whether there is room for improvement in the way women are portrayed. I turn to the point of the X-rated videos.</PARA></TALK.START>

But in common with most people in this place-perhaps this would be a wild statement-not many would want to watch it, though I would like to test that statement in the corridors outside.

All Australian Labor Party senators place serious weight on the matters she raised. Our action does not flow from a total disregard for women, or from a belief that there are not better ways of trying to reduce the problem of domestic violence. All those matters are of great concern to Labor senators. We do not believe that in moving the motion in Caucus yesterday we are moving away from addressing properly the whole issue. The question relates to the confusion about the difference between violence and sexually explicit material. That confusion is obvious all the way to Attorneys-General as was evidenced from the contribution by Senator Zakharov. There is no difference of opinion in the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday's Caucus decision to establish a further working party on videos was a complete sham. It was a public relations exercise to camouflage the Federal Government's continued legislative support for the hard-core porn industry-and that against the express and unanimous wishes of all the States of the Commonwealth and of the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material which had studied the problem over a period of three years.

Although physically non-violent, this material portrays women `as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for any opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material'. We are talking about group sex being a feature of the material and anal sex being included in the material. According to the evidence cited by the majority of members of the Joint Select Committee, such material engenders in the viewer a `sexually calloused and manipulative orientation towards women'. It mediates in the mind of the habitual viewer a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available. The majority observed that these viewers of pornographic videos come to accept and endorse the values represented in this material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where is the confusion? We knew and the State Attorneys-General knew what the material contained. What is the Caucus committee going to do to get the confusion out of the mind of the public? The Government's lame excuse was that the committee's job would be to examine means by which a reduction in the levels of violence in all categories of publicly available videos, especially those in the R category, would be brought about. It is seven months too late. The majority of members of the Joint Select Committee recommended that. The State Ministers ordered the Chief Censor and the Chairman of the Films Board of Review to apply tighter restrictions to violent films in M and R categories. That order was made on 30 June 1988.

Those people who are parading around the place and suggesting that they are strong on violence were the ones, including Senator Jenkins of the Australian Democrats, who did not support the motion.

<PARA> Generally, I do not raise my voice to more than a boring monotone, but it disturbs me that Senator Collins goes round the countryside calling everybody hypocrites. He calls those who oppose his point of view `mewling, puking hypocrites'. I will not accuse Senator Collins of being a puking hypocrite, or anywhere near it, but I do accuse him of being an utter humbug. He went on radio in Tasmania today and said, as he has before, and as reported in the Canberra Times, that when he became a member of the Committee he was initially in favour of banning X-rated videos. He joined the Committee in October 1987. I quote from what he said in the Northern Territory Legislative Council on 6 March 1985:</PARA>
<PARA> There are members on this side of the Assembly-and they will be free to say so-who want to see X-rated videos banned completely in the Northern Territory. I am sure there are many members on the opposite side of the Assembly who have also that view. That does not happen to be my personal view. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to speak in support of X-rated videos and voted for them to be made freely available. Who is a humbug? Then he accused Joe de Bruyn of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) of not knowing what he was talking about. He refused-if not dishonestly, something near to it-to quote from Joe de Bruyn's letter that went to every member of parliament on 3 November which indicated clearly that the decision of the council of the SDA was based on a complete and utter knowledge of the nature and content of videos which bear the X classification. Yet he continues to go on with that when both Joe de Bruyn and I know that, so far as rape is concerned, there is a lot of that material in R. That is the sort of stuff that needs to be reviewed also. That was his view and it is mine. I do not say that Senator Collins is a humbug in all areas, but he is in this one. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government do when all its arguments fail? It resorts to the slogan that people should have the right to view what they wish. Of course adults are free to look at and read what they choose. That is not the issue. Adults are also free to take poison if it is produced. What this Government is saying virtually is that this is not in the nature of a principle to be applied universally and uniformly, but rather a slogan to be used selectively and arbitrarily in a manner which lacks credibility. In the case of video pornography it resorts to its use rather than admitting to giving priority to the exploiting pornographers' claimed right to freedom of expression over all other individual and societal rights. All this goes back to the late Lionel Murphy and Senator Gareth Evans. When they tried to dump this hard core pornography on the community they said, `We want uniform legislation'. All the States have said that they do not want X-rated material. The Federal Government is the only one out of step. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a clear view on censorship. I would define censorship as the application of a carefully balanced and judiciously evaluated assessment of that which is conducive to the essential common good of an equal liberal and life affirming society. This material does none of that. I agree entirely with what Professor Zubrzycki, Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the Australian National University, said of video pornography. He said that video pornography functions quite similarly to anti-Semitic or racist propaganda: it serves as a tool of anti-female propaganda. He went on to say that the intent of all three is to distort the image of a group or class of people, to deny the fullness of their humanity and to depict them as objects for exploitation. That is precisely what X-rated video material does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to address this motion, I do not wish to align myself with the wowsers and moral majority of this country but to express a point of view that represents, I believe, the views of a large number of women of all political persuasions. The Labor Caucus decision not to ban X-rated videos in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) shows that the Government has resiled from its stated commitment to equality for women. X-rated videos which portray explicitly sexual scenes between men and women almost invariably portray women as passive, sexually submissive and devoid of human characteristics, and dehumanise them as persons worthy of dignity and respect. The Government justifies its decision to allow non-violent erotica in the ACT on the basis that it does not portray any coercion on the part of the women who participate in such videos. But there are many subtle ways in which these videos can denigrate women. Even where they are seen to take the initiative, it is in response to the fantasies of a masculine script writer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such videos are merely one end of the spectrum of sexual exploitation of women in the media and, as Senator Hill and others have said, it is quite inconsistent of the Government to express concern for the portrayal of women in advertising while supporting the development of a hard-core porn industry in the nation's political capital. One can only wonder whether the move is designed to satisfy the jaded sexual appetites of the male members of the Labor Caucus when sitting hours are over. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, I lost a job for using my business card to identify myself in a complaint against the sexist advertising of the multinational employment agency, Westaff. The subsequent publicity brought me many letters from women who wrote of the sexual harassment they had received from their workmates and bosses. Advertisements have unfortunately not changed a great deal since then. If we ban such advertisements from our television screens and billboards, is this to be regarded as censorship? Unfortunately, the Media Council's ethics committee, a body dominated by seven elderly men, has failed to include guidelines on sexism and sex role stereotyping in the new code of ethics for the advertising industry. Is it too much to ask the Government to establish a code of ethics in relation to video material?</PARA>
<PARA> X-rated videos are only a symptom and not the cause of a much more deep-seated problem of sexual exploitation in our society. It may have been useful to ban X-rated videos as a sign of public disapproval, but is the Government doing enough to counter the attitudes which lead to the production and demand for such videos? Psychological justifications for such videos are highly specious, often defending them for their therapeutic influence on sexually deprived males, and the alleged role of the videos in preventing rape. This is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a right to decide what kind of nation we want to be. We have a right to choose whether we receive and promulgate material that is degrading to women and therefore degrading to humanity. If we can choose advertising standards and ban cigarette advertising because it is bad for human health, we can also choose not to have such videos on the grounds that they are offensive to our notions of humanity, not to mention aesthetics, as Senator Jenkins said. </PARA>
<PARA> In defending such videos, civil libertarians are, I believe, misguided in the principles they apply to their judgment. We know how advertising operates in a subliminal way to affect consumer behaviour. In the same way, these videos influence how we regard women. The Government has not done enough to discourage the idea that female sex is a commodity like any other, and to establish mechanisms to encourage positive attitudes to women. Allowing X-rated videos in the ACT will certainly not contribute to this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal with just that section of the annual report of the Department of Finance which deals with government business enterprises. The main functions of the Department are listed on page 2 of the report, and they include:</PARA>
<PARA>the provision of advice to the Government on appropriate overall budgetary and financial policy issues generally;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>fostering the efficient and effective use of resources-</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it means in the public sector. The last one is:</PARA>
<PARA>conduct of major asset sales as required. </PARA>
<PARA>I move to the question of the selling off of some of the Government's business enterprises. I draw the Department's attention to the following words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last year, when he was talking about government business enterprises:</PARA>
<PARA>The question should not be: `why should we sell a given enterprise?' but `Why should we continue to tie up our resources in it?'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same speech he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Efficiency in the achievement of national goals is the key, not some ideological debate about appropriate aggregate levels of public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>As can be seen from that statement, at that stage the Government was talking about getting rid of some of its statutory authorities which are, in effect, in the business of being in business rather than in the business of providing services to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to a speech of the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, on 24 October of this year in which he, in effect, says that the Labor Government is not going to go down the same road as indicated by the Prime Minister last year in that speech, because he objects to the policy of the Liberal Party and the National Party of privatising or partially privatising the following statutory authorities: Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, domestic and international airport terminals, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Aussat Pty Ltd, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, Medibank Private and the Pipeline Authority. He refers to the Liberal and National Party coalition policies with regard to the privatising or partial privatising of these bodies, and he is critical of them. Senator Walsh goes on to claim:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government has embarked upon a major program of microeconomic reform, an important part of which is improving the efficiency of government enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Senate, and to Senator Walsh in particular, that all the Government has done up to now is deal with the peripheries of changing the names of these organisations and changing their controllers from their present statutory authority controllers to a board of management which will consist of the same people but will be under a different name; but there has been no major micro-economic reform at all in this area. It is about time the Government either fulfilled that role which it sees for itself-in other words, brought about major micro-economic reform in this area-or got on with the job of privatising these bodies and selling them to private enterprise, thereby giving private enterprise an opportunity to make these bodies financially worthwhile instead of the taxpayers of Australia having to continue to carry them. All this Government is on about is talking about reform and not acting in relation to reform. The sooner this Government gets on to actually doing something about reform, the better off this country will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important, in entering the debate on this legislation, that I make one point quite clear: the Australian Democrats have no objection whatsoever to what is perceived to be the Government's goal in this exercise, which is to provide the most efficient means possible for the Australian Taxation Office to do its job. That job is to collect taxation from those people in our community who are liable to pay tax. Nevertheless, as I made the point in a few short minutes before the debate was adjourned earlier today, such efficiency has to be within the bounds of what is socially acceptable. At that time, I made the point that we could have a very efficient economic system in this country if we were to remove from our economy all economically dependent people. We would not include children because they might grow up and become economically efficient in our society but we would have to eliminate the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unemployable-young or old. That would be efficient in economic terms. But of course we do not consider that kind of option because it is socially unacceptable, and thank goodness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the same way we have to look at what we want to do with the Tax Office and its ability to perform its task. Perhaps the most efficient system was that proposed some time ago in which all citizens would have a card with a photograph, a number and relevant data. Perhaps even more efficient would have been a tattoo on our foreheads. That was not proposed; the Australia Card was. The community said that that was not acceptable, so the Government went down another track. It has proposed an extended use of the tax file number. Again, it is important to make it clear that the Australian Democrats have no objection to the Taxation Office and the taxpayer using the tax file number in a more efficient way. But that is where it stops. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go to an article in the Melbourne Herald of 7 October last year in which Senator Haines said she would `support extension of the number's use to banks and other financial institution accounts only if it was made optional'. Indeed, in a number of other statements then and since the point has been made quite clearly that the tax file number should be for use between the taxpayer and the Tax Office only. In the earlier part of this debate we had claims from the Opposition-no doubt there will be more-that they have in their negotiations forced radical changes, to use Senator Michael Baume's words. He said that under the legislation, which the Opposition is now supporting, it is no longer compulsory for people to give their tax file number to financial institutions and that it is-again quoting Senator Baume-totally optional. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to define what is an option. As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, an option is not an option unless it is realistic. Certainly the deal done between the Opposition and the Government has a degree of option within it, but only for those people who are on high incomes and for whom the sanction of not spreading their tax file number all over the place is simply that their tax will be taken out at source at that time. It will be taken out at the top rate of tax, plus the Medicare levy. For high income earners who are paying that rate of tax anyway, it is not a problem. For them it is an option. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement that has been made between the Government and the Opposition and which will see unchanged passage of this legislation is not presenting an option for lower income earners. Indeed, it is a punitive situation for those people. People in the community who are concerned about the privacy aspects of this legislation but who are paying less than the top rate of tax are to face a sanction in terms of their choice, should they exercise it, in that their tax will be taken out at the top rate. It is only when they have filled in their tax returns and get their tax rebates that they can be refunded for the taxation which has come out. Of course, low and middle income families are so much under stress. This stress has been focused on by the Opposition in all sorts of debates, especially the recent debates in this chamber in relation to tax legislation. These are the people who will be very much hurt by what is called an option but is not an option. It is certainly not a poor person's option, although it may be an option for the rich friends of both the Government and the Opposition, or even the comfortable in our community. It seems that privacy is something one can have if one can afford it, according to the arrangement that has been made between the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume talked about the fact that these massive changes had been made to the legislation. The Opposition has persuaded the Government some way down the track. Of course, the removal of the provision for the freezing of bank accounts should the tax file number not be given is a positive move and is supported by the Democrats. Certainly, the inclusion of guidelines in the schedule to the Privacy Bill with regard to privacy provisions relating to the tax file number is a positive step forward and is supported by the Australian Democrats. Senator Baume said that this was now no longer Son of ID card. It is certainly not Daughter of ID card. I suggest it is a big brother exercise, at least for lower income people in our community. It is rubbish that this is now a totally optional system, as Senator Baume said. It is rubbish that there have been radical changes to the tax file number legislation. It is a deal made by the Opposition and the Government to the disadvantage of low income people. It is no problem for the rich and influential. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume in his contribution made the point that the Opposition does not want to give the Commissioner of Taxation more power. I reiterate that as far as the Democrats are concerned this is not a problem. We do not want to put in place a system where extensive data bases are built and then able to be misused. It is very important that unnecessary intrusions of privacy are not made possible. The Opposition does want to deny the Tax Commissioner more power. However, it does not seem concerned about the intrusive and draconian powers of the Department of Social Security in the area of information collection and disclosure which have led to incredible invasions of privacy in the lives of many people in our community since changes were made to the social security legislation following the 1987 mini-Budget. That does not seem to be a matter of concern at all to members of the Opposition. So I think it is clear whose privacy they are concerned about-the rich and influential, the employed, investors, taxpayers or people with tax liability; not low income earners and certainly not people who are dependent in one way or another in this society for income support from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pass to some of the comments made by Senator Aulich in the debate. I had been off at a conference and came back into this House, switched on my speaker and heard Senator Aulich waxing lyrical about the dangers of the large amounts of information held on individual members of the community by banks, credit reference agencies and all sorts of private industry employers. He went on about how employers were now linking their databases and communicating with each other about issues of people's employability and said that people in the community do not necessarily know what is on these data banks. I was then staggered to hear him say that he had heard nothing from the Democrats on concerns about this kind of information held within the private sector. I could scarcely believe my ears. Certainly Senator Aulich cannot have read my addendum to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in which I made it very clear that one reason I saw fit to add to what I considered to be a reasonable report under very difficult circumstances from the Committee looking into the whole broad issue of the feasibility of a national ID scheme and the tax file number over quite a long period was the very fact that I was concerned. I am an Australian Democrat and designated so in that report and I am surprised that the Chairman-this is the point Senator Aulich keeps reminding us of-of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card of historical note should not have read the report of a Senate standing committee on a similar issue some years later. My motivation was that I was very concerned about the very facts that Senator Aulich appeared to be concerned about today in the chamber. I say `appeared' because he, along with his Government colleagues and the Opposition, will vote for this legislation, which is absolutely deficient in the area-here I am referring specifically to privacy legislation-of giving any protection at all to members of the community as far as the private sector is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich and many other people in the community are concerned about the extent of databases which are being developed, the lack of knowledge that those databases exist and what is on them, the lack of access or the lack of the right to see what is there and to change if it necessary and the lack of any control over the use of such databases. All of this ought to be in adequate privacy legislation, and it was adequate privacy legislation that the Senate Committee suggested should be in place. `Appropriate privacy legislation' are the words from recommendation No. 9. I would also add that the Committee said that such legislation should be in place not later than the commencement of any enhanced tax file number legislation. So I challenge Senator Aulich quite strongly on a personal basis when he says that he has never heard from a Democrat on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I do know that Senator Haines-although I did not hear all her contribution in the debate earlier-made a point about that in this very debate. I do know that whenever Democrats have had an opportunity to speak on this issue this has been an issue of major concern. So I do not know where Senator Aulich has been. Mind you, I think he said, `I have never heard in this chamber a word from the Democrats'. All he has to do is absent himself from the chamber, as he has at this moment and does a great deal of the time, according to my observation of things. So perhaps we can excuse him from the point of view that he does not know what is going on in this chamber or perhaps anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly one of the major issues of concern for the Australian Democrats in this whole package is that the private sector remains untouched. That is not a surprise. What we have is a government which has pulled the rug of big business and privileged people in this community out from under the feet of an Opposition which thought it had that sewn up politically in this country. So we have an Opposition scrambling further and further to the right, looking for a place to exist in the political scene and looking for a lost constituency, and all the time both parties are falling over backwards not to upset their corporate mates. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move to another aspect that needs to be made very clear and is always made clear by the Australian Democrats in this debate but, of course, is ignored: that is our attitude, as I have said, to the approach of the responsibility of the Government and the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that people who have liability do pay their tax. I remind the Senate that the Australian Democrats have supported and congratulated this Government on its taxation reform over its period in office. We have been supportive of the introduction of the fringe benefits tax, the demise of the business lunch, and the capital gains tax-just taxes. Of course, they needed some adjustment and some amendment, which we have been able either to negotiate with the Government or to have passed on the floor of the chamber. But those sorts of tax reforms have had our support and will continue to have our support. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we have had an Opposition during that period-again, I think Senator Aulich pointed this out this morning-which has for month after month bleated in this chamber about the inequity of the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and certainly the business lunch; yet it is prepared to support this legislation. One area where both the Government and the Opposition agree, however, on the question of who should and should not, and who does not pay tax, is in the large corporate area. We want to see the Government make some more reforms. We want to see a situation where we will not have Bond Corporation actually boasting-that is the way it sounds at the moment anyway-about the fact that for the next two years it will not pay any company tax at all. It was expected to pay almost 1c in the dollar, but through the legal ability to purchase other companies and organise its corporate structure suitably, it is even able to avoid having to pay that amount of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the latest figures, published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 October, we see tax paid as a percentage of pre-tax profits by some of the major companies in this country: Quintex Australia, 0.11c in the dollar; Quintex, 0.15c; Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd, 0.43; Equiticorp Aust Ltd, 0.80c; Bond Corporation was supposed to pay 0.97c, but it got out of even that; Northern Star Holdings Ltd, 1.30c; Westfield Capital Corporation, 1.54c; Southern Farmers, 2.21c; Westfield Holdings, 2.50c; and David Jones (Aust) Pty Ltd a massive 4.11c. If we want tax justice and we want to ensure that the Tax Office collects the taxation and that the Government's revenue is as adequate as it ought to be, there is an obvious need for further tax reform in this area if not in others yet. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be much more appropriate, and I would certainly feel more comfortable, if the climate were different in this place, if it were not always only the Australian Democrats who pointed this out. One of the means by which this is able to happen is by the retention of negative gearing on foreign borrowing for company takeovers. This has been a scandalous exercise over the past few years and is escalating because the Government does nothing about it. Of course, it would not be able to get support from the Opposition for doing it. But we have said again and again that that is exactly the sort of measure that we would support. It would be a major advantage to the revenue of this country and a major move in taxation justice. We have no objection at all to that sort of thing happening and that is not the reason for our concern about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee stated that if the tax file numbers Bill were enacted it should:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . be strictly limited in its terms so that it applies only in relation to taxation purposes and those purposes be so framed as to prevent a progressive extension of the ambit of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee recommended that the tax file number should be limited to taxation purposes. The Australian Democrats agree with that. That was another reason why I felt it necessary to add to that Senate Committee's report. Clearly, this legislation, even with the welcome but very minor changes that the Opposition has been able to get the Government to agree to, will mean that this is not going to be the case, except of course for those well off people who can choose not to give their tax file number. Ordinary Australians, unless they want to face a taxation sanction, will be required to give their tax file numbers to private employers, stock brokers and private banks. All of these institutions will have access to the tax file number-the key to a significant database on individuals. Those people who receive income support in the education area through Austudy, those people-mostly female sole parents-involved with the Child Support Agency, which has been rather cleverly put under the control of the Australian Taxation Office, are included. I suggest that that is stretching the idea of tax purposes just a bit. </PARA>
<PARA> In my addendum to the report I clearly pointed out that the options put forward by the Australian Democrats ought to have been picked up by the Government. I believe that the Taxation Office would have been rendered far more efficient than it currently is, perhaps marginally not quite as efficient as it would like to be and will be under the system that will come in-at the risk of the privacy of individuals in the community-if it had taken up any of the options proposed by the Australian Democrats. We will continue to propose those options by way of amendment in the committee stage of this debate. However, even before we get to the committee stage of the debate we make it quite clear, by the second reading amendment moved by Senator Haines, what is necessary to make this legislation acceptable in order to achieve the Government's goal-which we support-of increased efficiency in the Taxation Office while, at the same time, protecting the privacy of Australian citizens. We propose to add at the end of the second reading motion:</PARA>
<PARA>``, but the Senate notes-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the Government's tax file number system is unacceptably intrusive in that the tax file number will be given to a range of private sector institutions which will not be adequately covered by the Government's privacy legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the Opposition parties' amendments to the tax file number legislation are meaningless to the ordinary taxpayer in that they only provide wealthy people with a real option not to supply the tax file number to private sector institutions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that the Government and Opposition parties are both to be condemned for their failure to support an alternative system which would have caught people who were cheating the tax system and protected the privacy of Australian taxpayers, and would not have laid the foundations of a national identification system''. </PARA>
<PARA>What we will be asking of the Government by way of amendment in the committee stage of the debate is an alternative system that gives people 30 days in which to notify the Taxation Office that they wish to exercise a genuine option not to distribute their tax file number to all and sundry and not to have their tax file number placed on the private data banks-something that so worried Senator Aulich earlier in the debate. Let us imagine for a moment that we are employed by IBM, Ciba-Geigy, or any other large multinational company. What would we know about where those databases go and what is on them? Many people in the community have said, `I do not mind who knows my tax file number'. That is fine. However, we do not know; we cannot know-there are no provisions to ensure that we do know-what use might be made of that information. </PARA>
<PARA> When there is a tax file number which is more universal than any other number-I grant that the proposed number is not as universal as was proposed under the Australia Card system; nevertheless the interchange of information between government departments was a major concern of the Committee-that number will be substituted for other numbers. Let us take the situation applying to students in this community-and we have more legislation coming up in regard to students and higher education. If one were running a tertiary institution-of course, they will become bigger if the Government gets its way with amalgamations; again, this is a measure the Australian Democrats will be opposing-one's students, at least those on Austudy, would have to provide their tax file numbers to that institution. How long would one continue to use another number such as the student's file number, within the institution? How long would it be before it would become more efficient for that institution to use the tax file number? It is a number which the institution can use to communicate with the Australian Taxation Office but one hopes and one presumes that no links will be established should a person who is involved in the child support scheme, which is under the control of the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office, decide to take a course of study under the Austudy system. The possibility for establishing those links is there. There is no provision either in the privacy legislation or the tax file numbers legislation to protect those people. Again, these are some of the most disadvantaged people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's agreement with the Government in regard to this legislation is a convenience only for the wealthy. The proposed Australian Democrat amendments will enable people to choose whether they supply the tax file number to the relevant private sector institutions. That amendment should be supported by those people who are concerned that individuals, should they want to-it is immaterial whether the majority do or do not want to-can retain the option of privacy. Individual privacy ought to remain an option for us in this democracy. Under this legislation, as a result of the deal between the Government and the Opposition, our privacy will not remain an option to us unless we can afford it. I suggest that that is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with two very major pieces of legislation in the one debate. The first Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, introduces a tax file number system. The second Bill, the Privacy Bill 1988, introduces, for the first time in Australia, major privacy legislation. In my opinion it is unfortunate that these two pieces of legislation are being dealt with together. Although they are related in some respects, the Privacy Bill is a major new piece of legislation which deserves a separate debate and separate consideration on its own merits because of the many problems that arise from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tax file number legislation is, of course, of equal importance. The Opposition has decided-I support that decision-to support both pieces of legislation. I do not propose to say very much about the tax file proposal; I have risen in this debate to speak mainly on the Privacy Bill. However, I believe that the tax file number system, as it has been redrafted by the Government-under a great deal of criticism and pressure from the Opposition-has become a workable piece of legislation. In company with the provisions of the Privacy Bill, there are a number of provisions-there are also a number of penalties-in the tax file numbers legislation to give reasonable protection for people's privacy when the tax file number system comes into use. </PARA>
<PARA> I have come to the decision to support the tax file number legislation with some misgivings. I believe that it is a piece of legislation that has to be very closely watched to ensure that the system does not lead to a de facto Australia Card with the very large numbers of people, institutions and so on that will have access to the tax file numbers of individual taxpayers using them as an identification system. The legislation makes it clear that that is not to be the case, and it provides for some very severe penalties for people who misuse the tax file number system. Nevertheless, the concern I have and I am sure many other people share is that there will be a temptation to misuse it. Therefore, it will need to be carefully monitored by the Government and the Opposition, and, indeed, by everybody who is concerned about his or her privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the efforts of the Opposition, major amendments have been made to both pieces of legislation. Specific provisions have been introduced into the Privacy Bill to deal with the tax file number question as well as general privacy matters, and amendments have been made to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill which make it clear that people will have an option not to provide tax file numbers, albeit that in that case tax will be withheld at the highest rate, and, therefore, their receipt of a credit will be delayed, until they finalise their taxation return for that year. So there is that severe penalty for people who do not provide a tax file number; nevertheless, they are given that very clear option in the legislation. Many people decide under the ordinary pay as you earn tax system to allow greater deductions to be made from payments to them as a means of saving, so the option given to them in this legislation of not providing tax file numbers if they do not wish to do so is not an unreal one. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I entered this debate to speak about the Privacy Bill and a number of concerns I have on the general question of privacy. I wish to refer to some particular provisions of the Bill, which is the Government's proposed solution to the problems in this area. I welcome the introduction of a Privacy Bill, but I must say that the Government has not really shown much attachment to providing some protection for privacy in our community. Under the Fraser Government, Attorney-General Ellicott gave a reference to the Law Reform Commission in 1976 on the question of protecting privacy. So it is not a new problem; it is one which has been around for many years. Over the 12 years since the matter was first referred to the Law Reform Commission by Mr Ellicott it has been a growing problem, and it will continue to be so. Nevertheless, the Government has taken what I can only call a very cavalier attitude to the Law Reform Commission's report, which was received by the Government in December 1983, nearly five years ago. The Government's only other attempt to act on that report was in conjunction with the Australia Card proposal. The privacy legislation has been brought in now only in regard to the Government's tax file number proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Government's only motivation for taking action in relation to the protection of privacy concerns its revenue-raising exercises. In many other respects this Government has shown a disinterest in the whole problem of privacy. Indeed, in its current attitude to the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure surveys it has shown no real concern about protecting people's privacy. It did not even bother to take the necessary steps to table its proposals before it embarked on the recent survey. It has belatedly done so under great pressure, again from the Opposition. That is a clear example of the fact that it has introduced a Privacy Bill only because it is clearly needed from a political point of view to justify the passage of the tax file number legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If it had not been for the Government introducing this Privacy Bill there is no way in which the Opposition would have entertained supporting the tax file number system. Indeed, the Government introduced the tax file number proposal without the Privacy Bill having been brought in. It was only at a very late stage, when it realised that the only hope it had of persuading the Opposition to support its tax file number legislation was to have adequate privacy legislation, that it did so. We have been asked to deal with this privacy legislation in great haste, and I shall deal with that problem in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the issue of privacy and the concerns in the community about privacy are of long standing and of growing concern. This has been revealed in the clearest possible terms in the great public debates that have taken place over the last year or so involving the Australia Card proposals and the tax file number proposal. It has clearly greatly concerned large numbers of Australians, who have expressed in no uncertain terms their feelings about this type of legislation. Australians are very concerned about the whole range of privacy matters, and these concerns have been given a sharp focus only as a result of the Government's proposal for the Australia Card which it first introduced a couple of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on these subjects has been going on for a long time, but there are many other matters about which people are worrying in relation to privacy. Those concerns have no doubt arisen because of the onset of the computer age and the fact that the Orwellian nightmare has now become a reality. The computer age has enabled a vast amount of information to be easily stored and exchanged, to be penetrated in many cases by people who have no authority to have it and to be used by people who have it without regard to the reasons why they have it. The very ease with which information can be exchanged and collected about a particular target has no doubt given this very sharp point to the problem of privacy. Therefore, I believe that we as parliamentarians have a responsibility to address the concerns of so many Australians on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that Australians believe that they have a right to privacy. I dare say many people who have thought about it in the past would have taken that view. The onset of those events has led to a much wider concern about this matter in the community. It comes at a time when people have developed a very healthy scepticism about governments and bureaucracies and what they are up to in regard to these matters. That has added even further importance to taking action about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where people demand a right to privacy. This has been denied to them by the common law and has only been partly addressed by parliaments in certain pieces of legislation. The most notable example of Parliament having recognised a right to privacy is shown in a section of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which imposes an obligation of secrecy on the officers of the Taxation Office-with some exceptions, of course-in relation to tax information. The success of taxation commissioners and the Taxation Office has developed a very notable standard of observance of that secrecy provision. There is a general confidence in Australia that taxation information has been kept secret. That is another reason why Australians are very worried about the dissemination of the tax file number. It is seen by them as the ways and means of breaching those secrecy provisions, although there are protections against that occurring. It is important and people do demand that type of secrecy which is contained in this legislation. There are other examples of this; I mentioned this only by way of example. This has been a concern for many years. It has been addressed in a piecemeal fashion in various different laws that have been passed by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are now talking about is a more general right of privacy and how it may be protected. It is unfortunate that the common law has not developed a right of privacy. Like parliaments, it has dealt with certain questions that have arisen, including defamation laws. Laws which are now developing in relation to protecting confidences are in place. Like the common law, they are the subject of development from time to time. There has not been a general right of privacy in the common law, nor have we in Parliament addressed the question until this parti- cular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this legislation has been rushed through the Parliament. It was introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 November and debated on 2 November. Admittedly, it had been given to the shadow Attorney-General a few days earlier and had been considered by the shadow Cabinet but it was not available to members or senators before it was introduced into the House of Representatives. That means that it was introduced in conjunction with the tax file number system proposal. The general attention in this debate has been more on that legislation than on the detailed provisions of the Privacy Bill. It is quite disgraceful on the part of the Government that it has taken this cavalier attitude to such an important problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Bill, which I support, does have major benefits in that it introduces a number of information privacy principles which are set out in the legislation. It establishes a watchdog on privacy known as a Privacy Commissioner. It gives that person a great many powers. It gives people some limited remedies in relation to breaches of privacy that is created in that legislation. It applies only to information about individuals which is held by Commonwealth agencies-that is, agencies of the Commonwealth Government, including departments, statutory authorities and so on. It also applies to the tax file number information that may be obtained by people in the private sector or by private individuals under the tax file number scheme. We know that employers, banks, financial institutions and so on will be in possession of that information. It applies in a limited sense to the private sector. Essentially, it is legislation which applies to the Commonwealth. It does not apply to the State governments. It does not apply generally to information that is held about people in the private sector. Although this is a reasonable beginning and we support it for that reason, it is nevertheless not adequate. The report of the Australian Law Reform Commission clearly indicated that the problem was a much wider one than information held by governments, serious as that may be. It is a problem which is much wider than that which is addressed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that there are certain limitations on the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution to deal generally with the problem of privacy. I am also well aware of the fact that there are countervailing questions. When a person claims that he has the right to privacy about a particular matter or particular information there are some countervailing considerations which have to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Numbers of people are entitled to have such information. Employers are entitled to have information about people they are proposing to employ or they are already employing. Credit agencies and credit providers are entitled to have information about people to whom they give credit. The main concern that people have is that information is being obtained and held about them which may not be correct. The second concern is that a lot of information may be held about them by people who have no real interest in the information and are going to use it for improper purposes or give it to other people to use for improper purposes. I do not suggest that all of these problems should have been tackled in this legislation. It may well be a matter which can be built on over time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not notice anything in the record of this Government, nor do I notice anything in what has been said by Government speakers in this debate, which indicates that the Government is doing anything more in relation to this matter than bringing forward this legislation as a means of getting the tax file number system through the Parliament. Clearly, the Government ought to be discussing these matters with the State governments because if there is going to be some general right of privacy it is a matter which will need to be widespread in Australia and which will need uniform legislation brought in by State governments. State governments ought to be encouraged by the Government to provide decent privacy legislation in relation to its own information that it is storing, the same as applies in relation to Commonwealth agencies. I would like the Government to indicate whether it will seriously pursue these matters. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is a very appropriate body to look at uniform legislation to protect individuals' rights. I would like to know whether the Government is pursuing this through that channel in regard to uniform laws that would apply widely through the private sector and in regard to information held by State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a provision to set up a Privacy Advisory Committee. The terms of reference of that committee do not seem to adequately address the questions I have raised. I believe that the time has come for some general right of privacy to be recognised by our law. It will probably have to be recognised by Parliament. The impetus will have to come from Parliament because I think the common law has run out of steam in that regard. As I said, it is a pity the common law did not develop it because it would have been better to have developed it in the way the common law proceeds by dealing with individual cases as they arise over a period and thereby developing certain principles which can be applied to later cases. I do not generally favour Parliament bringing in detailed legislation containing a lot of bureaucratic structures and providing the sort of complicated detail that occurs with legislation. I am certainly conscious of the problem, but I would like some assurance that the Government is seriously prepared to look at the matter to see whether it can come forward with further solutions than are contained in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some concerns about certain aspects of the present Bill, and in particular about the structure of the Privacy Commissioner and his great and diverse functions and as to the remedies that will be available under the legislation. The remedies here relate only to the limited areas I have mentioned-namely, information held by Commonwealth agencies and those who have the tax file number information. Some remedies are given, but it would have been far better if a general remedy had been granted for people to be able to take proceedings in the courts if they believed that the information privacy principles had been breached by Commonwealth agencies or by people in possession of a tax file number. Although the Bill contains limited rights, they fall very far short of that general right. I am pleased to note that the Opposition will be moving amendments in this House to take care of that problem so far as it can. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that there is a confusion of roles in relation to the Privacy Commissioner. His functions are most diverse and cover large administrative responsibilities, such as research into and monitoring developments in data processing and computer technology, and the function of advising the Minister about various matters relating to privacy. Also involved is the question of promoting privacy principles in the community and educating people about those principles. Furthermore, there is a responsibility to conduct information audits and also to encourage the private sector to develop systems of privacy of information, which is itself a huge problem to which I have already alluded. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to all these diverse functions, the Privacy Commissioner is obliged to investigate complaints about breaches of the legislation. As I understand it, he can call compulsory conferences to try to resolve complaints, presumably by conciliation, mediation and so forth. At the same time this person is given the responsibility, if that does not succeed, to proceed in a quasi-judicial way to determine and resolve any complaint. He can give remedies, pronounce that conduct should not continue and can give people compensation and costs. There are some odd statements as to how he can direct people to perform certain reasonable acts-what lawyers would call remedy of specific performance, which always presents some enforcement problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This seems to me to present a confusion of roles and a basic lack of conceptual thought by the Government about this important aspect of the legislation. I believe that there are better precedents for dealing with matters in this type of legislation in the race discrimination and sex discrimination fields, where there has at least been some semblance of separating the functions-the administrative, investigative, conciliation and mediation functions, which may appropriately be those of the Privacy Commissioner, from the actual adjudication of complaints and decisions as to whether there has been a breach and the granting of remedies. It is beyond the Opposition, except by way of numerous amendments, to fix up this problem. I hope that the Government will re-examine the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When this legislation is enacted and the Privacy Commissioner is in business, I am sure that many problems will arise because of the creation of this bureaucratic structure. Certainly Opposition senators have had no time to study this matter in full. Clearly, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill must be passed with the Privacy Bill. Indeed, the Government has brought in the two Bills together and the Senate is debating them together, despite the fact that they relate to two large serious and important subjects.</PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this legislation with some misgivings in relation to both Bills, I welcome the privacy initiative. I believe that the Government is to be given some praise for the fact that it has at last now introduced a first step-and it can only be regarded as that-in giving effect to that general right of privacy which such vast numbers of Australians today believe they should have, and indeed demand that governments and parliaments accord to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the first government to get a report on it-and a very good report it was. Following Senator Durack's remarks and taking up his challenge that the Government is more interested in the collection of revenue than in the privacy of the citizen, it is worth going through the Bill and seeing what it provides for. It seeks to stop unwarranted interference in people's privacy. It is true, as Senator Durack said, that the Bill is limited in its cover. It does not stop State governments or the private sector interfering with people's privacy unless that interference arises consequent on the operation of the proposed tax file number. There is good reason for that-not the least being the Constitution and its provisions. Clause 13 of the Privacy Bill defines the areas within which the legislation purports to operate. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the purposes of this Act, an act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual if, and only if, the act or practice: (a) in the case of an act or practice engaged in by an agency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that agencies are confined to Government bodies-either departments or government instrumentalities. Agencies as defined do not go beyond the Commonwealth Government and its instrumentalities. Paragraph (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> in the case of an act or practice engaged in by an agency . . . breaches an Information Privacy Principle-</PARA>
<PARA>I will turn briefly to information privacy principles later-</PARA>
<PARA>in relation to personal information that relates to the individual</PARA>
<PARA> in the case of an act or practice engaged in by a file number recipient-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a tax file number recipient, under the tax file number legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>breaches a guideline under section 17 in relation to tax file number information that relates to the individual; or</PARA>
<PARA> involves an unauthorised requirement or request for disclosure of the tax file number of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the Privacy Bill takes on board two streams of information. There are the provisions directed at protecting privacy in the use of the proposed tax file number and there are provisions safeguarding other information about people that the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities hold. Sanctions for the breach of proposed laws protecting tax file information are more stringent than those protecting other forms of information kept by the Government. For example, the provisions in clause 26 of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill relating to a breach of a person's privacy are quite stringent. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for that is that the Commonwealth has more power to regulate the information that it accumulates under the tax file legislation than it has in respect of other information that comes within its power. That is because the Constitution gives the Commonwealth more extensive power in legislating to protect the tax file number information than in other areas. I want to make it clear, in light of what Senator Durack said, that the Commonwealth has limited power in protecting private information about people but, in so far as it has that power, it has exercised it to the fullest extent possible. Where it has considerably more power, as in the case of the tax file number, than it has in respect of other information that comes within its keeping, it has brought in stricter sanctions than would otherwise apply. That is an indication of its dedication to the privacy of the Australian citizen. Hopefully, arising out of this legislation, other governments in Australian will follow down the line which the Commonwealth has marked, or go down the path that it has already gone down, because privacy should be an essential feature of the society in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack spoke about the Privacy Commissioner and was critical, to some extent, of the Commissioner's functions. The office of Privacy Commissioner is set up under clause 19 of the Bill. Clause 36 gives any individual, any citizen of Australia, the right to complain about interference with his or her privacy, so long as that interference is of the sort defined in clause 13; that is, it has to be an interference with the privacy that he or she can expect in respect of information supplied to government. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke of the information privacy principles. They are set in clause 14. They define the way in which information coming into the hands of the Commonwealth Government should be dealt with. Those privacy principles are supplemented, in respect of the tax file number information, or any information coming into the Government's hands under the tax file number scheme, by clause 17 of the Bill, which obliges the Privacy Commissioner to set out in writing guidelines concerning the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information. Those guidelines are subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament under the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought to give Parliament the right to oversee guidelines in respect of information coming into government hands-that is, the tax file number information-and it has sought to provide tests, through the information privacy principles, as to how other information should be sought. The Opposition, through Senator Durack, has said that this Government is not concerned fundamentally with privacy questions. However, the provisions of the legislation indicate that it is a well thought out scheme, a scheme dedicated, uniquely in Australia among the governments of Australia, to the preservation of people's privacy, to the establishment of tests which will be applied to people in government who have information about citizens coming into their hands, and it provides remedies for people if that information is surrendered where it should not be surrendered. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack spoke about the Commissioner's functions and said that they were too broad. That was the general thrust of what he said. The functions are set out in clause 27 of the Bill. As there are several I will not read through them. However, some should be chosen for particular mention. The clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to this Part, the Commissioner has the following functions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to investigate and act or practice of an agency that may breach an Information Privacy Principle and, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so, to endeavour, by conciliation, to effect a settlement of the matters that gave rise to the investigation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If conciliation is not successful he can even go ahead and make a declaration that a person whose privacy has been violated should receive some sort of compensation and that declaration can be enforced in the Federal Court. Other functions set out in clause 27 include the provision that the Commissioner should promote an understanding and acceptance of the information privacy principles and of the objects of those principles; that he should provide advice to a Minister or an agency on any matter relevant to the operation of the proposed Act; and that he should conduct audits of records of personal information maintained by agencies for the purpose of ascertaining whether the records are maintained according to the information privacy principles. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth repeating that this legislation will, if passed, give limited but nevertheless comprehensive protection to people's privacy. Hopefully, it will provide-I agree with Senator Durack on this-a precedent that will be expanded upon and adopted by other governments. It is a Bill that can be, I think, legitimately criticised in the ambit of its operation, but against that it is a Bill which has blazed a new trail. It should be said that the Privacy Commissioner will operate through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That provision is part of a package of measures aimed at helping people protect their privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The information privacy principles are set out in clause 14 of the Bill. Those principles are akin to the guidelines on the protection of privacy and the transborder flows of personal data developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris in 1981. The interesting thing is that the OECD guidelines are not confined to information held by government. Even though this Privacy Bill deals only with information held by or originating with government, plus information relevant to the tax file number scheme, and even though the information privacy principles set out in clause 14 of the Bill are confined to that purpose, they are based on the OECD guidelines, which, in turn, are not confined to government. Those guidelines are expressed generally. That is apt, because a person's privacy can be prejudiced by the private sector as well as the public one. It can be prejudiced just as much by a State government or a local council as it can by a Federal government. Hurt to people through a violation of their privacy can be gross, whether inflicted by public servants or officers of a private company. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, it is often said that people who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear from having their lives laid bare. I often think that that statement presumes that those receiving information about others will treat it fairly, will judge it accurately and will use it honourably. It is presumed that revelations about people will be reported fully or, if selectively, kindly. I will not give examples, but people in this chamber will know that over the years this has just not been so. People's reputations and lives can be quite dramatically influenced and, in many cases, ruined because of statements that are made about them. Had some respect been paid to their privacy, their feelings and their right to a good reputation unless it could be conclusively proved otherwise, many a reputation that has been besmirched would not have been treated in such a way. People's reputations have been besmirched in this place, in other parliaments, in courts, in royal commissions, in judicial inquiries and in the media. They can be besmirched in conversations in all sorts of places, even in people's neighbourhoods by those who are supposed to be friends. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack touched on this matter, saying that the common law does not afford a right to privacy, and that is correct. I also agree with him that it is bad and a tragedy that it does not. We probably do not have time to deal now with the question of why a concept of privacy has not been developed in the common law, but I think it is a question that should be dealt with at some other time. In any event, that lack in the common law ought to be progressively remedied from here on in. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, some people believe that privacy can at times be quite nonchalantly compromised. It is argued that people should not worry about that because if they have nothing to hide they have nothing to lose. I have already said that that is a proposition that does not bear close examination. In the general context of the right that we should have to lead our lives as best we are able without undue interference or unwarranted intrusion from outside, the Privacy Bill is one of a number of measures which both sides of the political fence in this Parliament have sought to do something about over the years. In this respect, I am talking about a package of Bills to which the Privacy Bill will be an honourable addition. This package includes legislation such as the Freedom of Information Acts which was passed under the previous Government; the Ombudsman Act 1976; the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act; the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986; and the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. So there is a package of legislation aimed at giving people protection against the intrusions of government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I think the great lack in this area lies in the fact that, although people are protected to some extent from intrusions of government, they are not sufficiently protected from intrusions by organisations which may have information about them stored in databanks, which may be able to interfere with their private lives and which may, to their ruin, talk about matters which they, as victims, cannot correct sufficiently. I think it is time that State governments, which can legislate in this area, looked at how people can be affected by the private sector and brought in legislation in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack has criticised the Labor Government for not going far enough in its actions to protect people, but what would the position be if the coalition were now in power? What would it do about the rights of citizens? What would it do about providing freedom of information (FOI) legislation, privacy legislation and equal opportunity legislation if it had the opportunity? In that respect, I notice that the Greiner Government, which has now been in power for a significant period, promised that it would introduce freedom of information legislation when it took office. Indeed, it did introduce a draft form of legislation. But that, for whatever reason, has been put over now for consideration next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Tim Robertson of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties had some comments to make about the proposed freedom of information legislation in New South Wales. On 21 September 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom of information is about power. When a Government resolves to introduce a Freedom of Information regime it is involved in the process of power sharing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. But later in his address he had this to say about the New South Wales legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>I referred earlier to the possible consequence of a good FOI law, one that recognised that the devolution of power from the Government to the citizen was an important value. There are four provisions of this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the New South Wales Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>which, taken together or severally, will prevent this law from achieving that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>that is, the purpose of devolving power from the Government to the citizen. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Briefly, they are the provisions for charging,-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for imposing a charge on people who want to make use of the freedom of information legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>the power of Ministers to give a conclusive certificate in relation to restricted documents,-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, under the draft legislation, as I understand it, the Ministers will be able to give a conclusive certificate which cannot be challenged in any court or similar tribunal about whether the documents ought to be revealed under FOI or not. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>the absence of any requirement to give adequate reasons for refusing access to documents-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a provision one would have hoped would have been there; that if somebody is going to be refused access to documents, some explanation should be given to him or her-</PARA>
<PARA>and the power to refuse to process complex FOI requests if, in the opinion of the agency concerned, it would involve too much work to do so. The last ground for refusing to deal with FOI users is a favourite one with the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want it to be alleged that I have not quoted fully. What is shown by Jim Robertson's address is that when the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia have the power to introduce legislation of a category in which the Privacy Bill which we are presently debating would fit, firstly they are very circumspect about doing so; and secondly, the legislation that they do introduce is very restrictive in the rights it gives to the citizen. So when criticism in this chamber is made of the Bill by those in Opposition, I challenge the Opposition to indicate why we on this side should expect that it would act any differently from how Mr Greiner has acted in New South Wales in respect of the freedom of information legislation which he trumpeted about so proudly before he was elected to office. Contrast that to the freedom of information legislation that was introduced in Victoria when the Cain Labor Government came to power. The contrast is striking. That is an Act which is very generous to the private citizen. It has a public interest provision which overrides any objection that might otherwise be made-in other words, even in the case of documents which prima facie are restricted and cannot be made available to somebody seeking them under the freedom of information legislation in Victoria, if a person can show an overriding public interest, then those documents are made available. The contrast between the legislation in Victoria and the proposed legislation in New South Wales is marked. </PARA>
<PARA> So the criticism that comes from the other side, that this Privacy Bill is simply a mechanism or instrument to get the tax file number legislation through the Parliament, cannot, on examination, be sustained. Indeed, if one looks at the very detailed provisions in the Privacy Bill and at the very severe penalties attached to breaches of the law regarding the tax file number in the tax file numbers Bill itself, it becomes apparent that this is a Government which is very serious about privacy, very serious about the rights of citizens and very serious about maintaining those broad freedoms which we enjoy in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the Opposition has joined the Government in supporting this legislation. I hope with some confidence that the provisions in the legislation will expand over the years and that the guidance and the lead given by the Federal Government will be adopted by the State governments as time goes by because privacy is something that is very much worth while protecting and it should become an entitlement which we can all enjoy. I hope the legislation will ultimately prevent people being blackguarded, from having their reputations besmirched and from suffering hardships to themselves and their families in the way that happens all too often in this society at the moment. I think there is time to look at where we are going as a society and to draw back from the readiness we seem to have to ruin reputations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the previous speakers in this debate from both sides of the House have drawn particular attention to the need to protect the privacy of ordinary citizens. As honourable senators will have noticed, the Australian Democrats are moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading, an attachment to the motion, because we believe that by quite a simple mechanism a much more effective protection of privacy could have been achieved but both the Government and the Opposition have failed to take up this very simple device.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill and the accompanying Privacy Bill which seeks to protect the privacy of individuals. The tax file number is being created as a high integrity number so that financial transactions information involving citizens, transactions which are tax relevant, can be reliably linked to that high integrity tax file number and through that mechanism citizens will be prevented from evading tax. Of course, the Democrats are wholly in favour of such a procedure. The procedure involves an improvement in the integrity of the tax file number so that every individual will have only one tax file number, and that number will be linked to every transaction which is tax relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter we are debating this afternoon is that that process shall not involve an invasion of the privacy of that individual. Once one has a number with a very high integrity, which is linked to an individual and which links that individual with a number of financial transactions, the provision of that number leaves that individual open, through the great capacity which is now available in computers, even at the home computer level, to the possibility that that information could be abused and misused. It could be to the detriment of individuals if that high integrity number should fall into the hands of those who have no business to have it. The Democrats are proposing that that number should be known only to the individual and to the Australian Taxation Office, and that that is quite easily achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Cooney has already indicated, information can readily be linked from different sources through the use of that universal identifier-that high integrity tax file number. People can draw quite wrong conclusions from linking those bits of information and those wrong conclusions can be readily promulgated. The individual need have very little knowledge of who has put that information together and where that false conclusion has emanated from to that person's detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example which demonstrates the point quite easily. During the last election I asked a number of friends to provide me with names and addresses of people who may be sympathetic to my election to this Parliament. Through that process I accumulated a database in my home computer which involved several thousand names and addresses. It was very easily done. I did not want to send information unnecessarily to the same address to service several people, so through a couple of quite simple key strokes I asked my computer to put together the names of all those people who lived at the one address. Within a few seconds I had those names and addresses on the screen. I was quite interested and surprised to find out certain information. `He is living with her, I didn't know that', and `He's living with him'. Knowing certain other bits of information about the people concerned, I might have drawn some conclusions which may have been correct or incorrect. Certainly, I could have used that information in ways which could have been damaging to those individuals. That is a very small example with a home computer which can be done very easily. </PARA>
<PARA> Once one links that type of information, information on health and all the tax relevant information with this high integrity identifier-the tax file number-the possibility for misuse becomes extremely wide and extremely worrying. I do not think that honourable senators in this place realise the increase in the power of modern computers, which is developing very quickly. For instance, it is now possible to have on a home computer information on every citizen in Australia. That is quite achievable with a computer costing not much more than several thousand dollars. If one allows that, information on a person's tax file number will very quickly become available, and that becomes a very powerful tool in the hands of a large number of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The task which the Australian Democrats set themselves was very interesting. It was an attempt to devise a scheme which would allow everybody to have this high integrity tax file number so that anti-tax evasion requirements could be met and, at the same time, ensure that that tax file number was known only to the individual and the Tax Office. Such a scheme is very easy to devise. We are extremely disappointed to find that the Government has not adopted that scheme and that the Opposition is not prepared to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme would work like this: when an individual went into a bank or to a potential employer-in fact, was about to enter any transaction which was tax relevant-the individual would be asked to provide certain information. That information would be provided on a form with several carbon copies. Imagine a person was opening a bank account. The bank would ask for certain information to be provided by the individual opening the bank account. The bank would then send the second copy-the carbon copy-of that form to the Tax Office. The other carbon copies would be provided to the individual who opened the account. The individual would simply provide the tax file number on the next carbon copy, so that all the information which was already entered on the form would still be there, plus the tax file number in this case. The individual would then provide that copy to the Tax Office and the Tax Office would simply marry those two forms. When the Tax Office had the information relating to the opening of the bank account together with the tax file number, it would notify the bank that it had the tax file number for that person and that there was no need to withdraw tax at the maximum rate. In that simple way, the Tax Office would get the information it needed and the tax file number would be kept private to both the individual and the Tax Office. Nobody else would have access to that number. </PARA>
<PARA> Objections have been raised to such a scheme. It has been claimed that the Tax Office and the bank would be flooded with paper work. Again, I suggest that honourable senators in this place simply do not understand the way in which offices have become so extensively computerised. Most of this work would in fact be done by a computer. Already the Tax Office will have to receive notification from the bank when an account is opened. That form will go to the Tax Office anyway, but it will not be dealt with by the Tax Office by way of a piece of paper. As soon as information is received it will be entered into the Taxation Office computer. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the scheme I have just outlined, when the copy of that form sent by the person who has opened the bank account is sent to the Tax Office, it includes the tax file number. Again, a keyboard operator would simply enter that information directly into the Taxation Office computer; the matching would not be done by hand but by computer. The computer would immediately indicate that that information matched. If there were any difficulties-that would be a very small number of applications for employment, bank accounts and the like-the Tax Office would go back to the original forms and make sure that they did indeed match. If they did not, the bank would not be notified by the Tax Office that it had a satisfactory tax file number and tax would be withheld. </PARA>
<PARA> The other objection to the scheme has been raised, I think, by Senator Stone. He said there is not an absolute necessity to provide the tax file number; one can have tax withdrawn at the maximum rate and then, at the end of the year, through the processes of submitting taxation returns, groups certificates and the like, claim that tax back. That is a facility which is readily taken up by the rich in our society but not so readily taken up by the poor. That argument fails substantially on the grounds of equity. I simply point out that on my home computer I certainly keep extensive databases on a number of people. As soon as the tax file number becomes available and that falls into my hands, I will certainly use that as an identifier because it will be far more reliable than either an address or a name. That will happen throughout the community very quickly, both in State and in Commonwealth government departments. It will happen with private databanks and, of course, we are then right back to the situation which we attempted to avoid with the Australia Card legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I point out that there is indeed a very simple mechanism by which the joint and laudable objectives of preventing tax evasion and also protecting the privacy of individuals can be achieved. It is simple, it is cheap, it is effective and it does not involve protecting the rich compared with the poor. I believe that we will very quickly live to regret the day that this Parliament did not impose onto this system the proposal which the Australian Democrats have put forward. It is for that reason that the Democrats will be moving the amendment to the motion for the second reading to which I referred earlier. All we can say is that we are disappointed that the amendments which would have given effect to our proposal have not been supported by either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Government's Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill and the Privacy Bill, I want to concentrate on the latter. As has been said by previous speakers, the Opposition is supporting both Bills, although we will certainly be looking to some amendments to the Privacy Bill at the committee stage. We agreed to support the tax file numbers system Bill when it became, in effect, a voluntary scheme and, furthermore, when we were satisfied that an adequate privacy Bill was being put before the Parliament, the operation of which would commence at the same time as the tax file system. It took some effort before the Government was prepared to meet that objective. Nevertheless, it was achieved and therefore, as has been previously said, the Opposition is supporting both Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose any discussion of privacy should start with article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which came into force on 23 March 1976. The key provision of the Covenant, article 17, states:</PARA>
<PARA> No-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a laudable objective which we on this side of the chamber would obviously support and objectives that were based on the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I guess the next stage in the development of privacy as an international concept is the role that has been taken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and as is stated in the Bill itself, Australia has agreed to the guidelines set out by the council when it recommended that member countries take into account in their domestic legislation certain principles concerning the protection of privacy and individual liberties. Of course, in some part this Bill is based upon those guidelines and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time there have been those learned within our community exhorting us to take action in relation to a lack of provision within the Commonwealth law protecting personal privacy. I will only mention the contribution that was made by Sir Zelman Cowen. I refer in particular to his Boyer Lectures of 1969 in which he examined the manifold threat to the privacy of the individual that has existed in this century and suggested how, as a society, we should face this problem as a matter of social policy and law. He quoted the American writer Clinton Rossiter as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Privacy is a special kind of independence which can be understood as an attempt to secure autonomy in at least a few personal and spiritual concerns, if necessary in defiance of all the pressures of modern society . . . it seeks to erect an unbreakable wall of dignity and reserve against the entire world. The free man is the private man. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The protection of privacy would be better assured by appropriate legal protections and procedures, but it also depends to a very great extent upon the attitudes of men and women in a democratic society to the values which are enshrined in the claim to privacy. It seems to me that in our lack of awareness and indifference, our responses to the growing threats to privacy are too often feeble and flabby . . . we cannot assume that privacy will survive simply because man has a psychological or social need for it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that they are words that we should heed. They were certainly heeded by this side of the chamber when the former coalition Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission a reference to examine the question of privacy, which reference, was referred, I think, in 1976, but it was not until 1983 that the Law Reform Commission put down its three-volume report, and it has taken from 1983 until now, in late 1988, for this Bill to appear. Nevertheless, better late than never. We, on this side of the chamber, are pleased that with our support and our contribution-I will detail that in a few moments-we are now going to be enacting through this Parliament privacy legislation. We believe that that is an important achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australia will not be the first of the Western nations to have gone down this path; in fact, we lag behind quite a few of them. For example, I note that the Federal Republic of Germany passed its Federal Data Protection Act in 1977. Sweden, which I understand was the first country to pass this type of legislation, passed its Data Act in 1973. France passed its law on information, databanks and freedoms in 1978. The United Kingdom's Data Protection Act became law in July 1984. Part IV of the Canadian Human Rights Act of 1977 also gives some protections in this regard. So we are moving down a path that has been taken by a number of the Western democratic nations, and although we might be a little behind some of them, we in the Opposition are pleased that it is now occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> What I wanted to do at this stage is very briefly look at the structure of the Bill. I will be brief because it has also been covered by other speakers. Basically the Bill will establish the office of a Privacy Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Commissioner will be empowered to take privacy protection measures in relation to the Commonwealth departments and agencies and tax file number users. The Bill establishes rules of conduct called information privacy principles (IPPs) for the collection, retention, access to, correlation, use, et cetera, of personal information about individuals. As I said a moment ago, in part based on the guidelines provided by the OECD the Bill treats breaches of these IPPs as an interference with privacy. Commonwealth agencies are required to avoid doing things which amount to interferences with privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to remedy in case of breach, the Privacy Commissioner is first instructed by the legislation to look to a resolution by conciliation. We support that. However, if that does not prove possible, he can then make determinations that could include a declaration that an agency which has breached the IPP should not repeat such conduct and/or that the agency should pay damages by way of compensation and also meet any expenses that have been suffered by the individual concerned. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner will be empowered to investigate complaints concerning the misuse of tax file numbers in the public and private sectors. We also support that. In relation to abuses, again, the Privacy Commissioner is given a responsibility first to attempt to conciliate but, subject to the failure of that, to make determinations which might be enforceable in the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that the Bill now includes interim guidelines in relation to the tax file number system which must be adhered to by agencies and recipients of tax file information. Of course, the Bill did not originally include such a provision. Just for a moment I want to put the Bill in the context of a series of events. When the Government's identity card, the so-called Australia Card, failed last year, with it failed the 1986 Privacy Bill. The Government decided, and stated in the May economic statement, that it would, as an alternative go down the path of a tax file number scheme. What the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not say in the May economic statement or in the expansion that concerned tax file numbers, which included the business part of the supplements to that statement, was whether there would be any separate privacy legislation at all. One can presume that at that time the Government, in any event the Treasurer, did not intend to go down the path of legislation that we now have before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stage in the scenario, particularly after that point had been made publicly and objected to by a number of commentators, was that the Treasurer stressed in a press release of 14 June 1988 that there would be adequate, strict privacy safeguards within the tax file legislation itself. Again, when in due course the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988 appeared, in the first instance that seemed to be the direction which the Government was still taking, except that the Treasurer, again after being pressed, indicated that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) would be preparing a Privacy Bill. It was not intended, however, to be part of this package. Even when the Attorney-General himself subsequently made reference to the Bill which he was preparing he said that it was to be supplementary and introduced and dealt with at a subsequent time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition found that totally unsatisfactory. As honourable senators will be aware, the Opposition insisted that if we were to deal with tax file number legislation we would expect to deal with a Privacy Bill at the same time. As that also appeared to be the attitude of the Australian Democrats, the Government had little alternative but to cooperate with our demands. Of course, Senator Tate, acting for the Attorney-General who was overseas, produced a draft Bill that was given to Mr Neil Brown, our shadow Attorney-General, for his consideration. That Bill, as is now history, was found to be significantly deficient and caused the Opposition to write to Senator Tate setting out a series of very significant criticisms; setting out the major shortfalls that were obvious from a perusal of the Government's intended Privacy Bill-what the Government intended to become the privacy law for this Commonwealth. For example, there were no specific provisions in the Bill for privacy of tax file number information. The Bill provided only for guidelines to be issued at some time in the future by the Privacy Commissioner. Even then, it was the case only that they may be issued by him; not that they shall be issued by him. Government agencies were to be able to obtain exemption from such guidelines on the ground of public interest. It does not take much experience to see the enormous loophole that could be presented by that exemption. No complaint could be made to the Privacy Commissioner for the first six months. What was to happen in the first six months was that the government agencies were to have the opportunity to apply for exemption on the ground of public interest. Again, the scenario that would have developed was quite apparent from a reading of the Bill; departments would have used that six months to apply for exemption, they would have demonstrated that it was in the public interest, as so many government departments do so easily, to justify exchange of personal information between them. That experience would have recurred in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provided also that the Privacy Commissioner could enter premises of Government agencies, but only on notice. Of course, that caused us to ask why the Privacy Commissioner's powers were to be weaker than those of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. There was no right given in the Bill to sue for privacy-something I will come to in a moment-and, of course, we criticised the fact that the injunctive power simply was not wide enough. We also criticised the fact that the tax file number legislation was to come into operation on receiving royal assent but that the Privacy Bill was to come into operation only on proclamation. Therefore, even at that stage, on the production of the draft Bill, it seemed that the privacy legislation was to come into operation at a later date-something that we regarded as unsatisfactory. There was no objects provision in the Bill showing clearly what the Government was trying to achieve. Principles 10 and 11 which were said to provide an exemption for the protection of public revenue obviously again showed a serious deficiency and a serious escape mechanism. The requirements on the Privacy Commissioner to report to the Parliament were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the form of the Bill that was presented to the Opposition and which the Government, if it had had the numbers, would have passed through this Parliament. It was a very significantly deficient piece of legislation. I am pleased to be able to say-no doubt it only follows from the fact that the Government has not got the numbers-that most of these criticisms we made were then addressed positively by it. In other words, the Government recognised that it simply would not get its tax file number legislation unless it ensured that the public was protected against the abuse of information, particularly tax file information, through an adequate form of privacy legislation. As I said, most of the recommendations that were made were accepted. Because they were accepted we indicated that we would therefore support the legislation before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two remaining areas in which we indicate now, as we indicated in the House of Representatives, additional amendment is required, in our view, to make the Bill satisfactory to be passed. The first relates to the question of remedies, something that I mentioned a moment ago. We on this side of the chamber believe that there should be provision in the Bill to enable a citizen who has suffered an invasion of his or her privacy to seek damages in the common-law courts. We believe that the remedies that are contained in the Bill as it stands at the moment are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area in which we say that there should be further amendment relates to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The Bill as it stands gives a respondent the power to seek a review of an order for compensation and/or expenses, but there is no power for the AAT to give compensation in the event of the Commissioner determining not to give that compensation. We cannot see why private individuals in this country should not be treated in the same way as governments in being able to utilise the provisions of the AAT in this way, and we will therefore be seeking to amend the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In those two areas we will be seeking in the committee stage to have amendments passed that we believe will result in a better piece of legislation. Having said that, we do not claim that the Bill that is in the process of being passed is perfect. We are aware that a number of civil liberty organisations around the country would like to see changes and further strengthening; nevertheless, it has been a long time in coming and we believe that, with the improvements we have been able to force upon the Government, it is a worthwhile starting piece of legislation in an area which is critically important and which the Opposition believes requires the support of government through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who served on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when it dealt with the whole question of the information that governments hold on individuals and the way in which governments so readily transmit that information between departments were somewhat shocked, firstly, by the enormous volume of personal information that is held, and, secondly, by the way in which that information is shunted from department to department, in effect building up very comprehensive information banks on individuals, that information often being of a very personal and private nature. Of course, governments now have the further capacity to compulsorily gain information from the private sector to add to those banks of information. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber strongly believe that it is necessary to have in place a piece of legislation that would in some ways protect individuals from abuse by government of personal information, and we believe that the Bill that will be passed in the next day or so is a very worthwhile step in the right direction in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has consistently made it clear that it is totally and utterly opposed to taxation fraud and welfare cheating. In fact, it was in October last year that the coalition parties said they would give full support to any reasonable measures which effectively eliminated tax fraud and which welfare cheating, which were cost effective and which did not unreasonably intrude upon personal privacy and individual liberties. At that stage we made it quite clear that we supported moves that would upgrade the integrity of the tax file number system and would consider favourably any proposals designed to improve the use of the tax file number for proper taxation and welfare purposes, such as those already provided for the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, we emphasised that we would vigorously oppose any attempt to turn a tax file number system into a de facto Australia Card system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essential purpose of this Bill is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Office's income matching system as a means of furthering the attack on tax evasion. There is no doubt that we reject all degrees of taxation fraud and welfare cheating. Our tax system is supposed to be built on the premise of equity, with every person paying his or her fair share of tax. If one person or one organisation does not pay his, her or its share, somebody else has to cover the payment of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the tax file number system did not threaten civil liberties Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Attorney-General in the other House, insisted on a tightening of the secrecy provisions and the introduction by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) of separate privacy legislation. In addition, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) accepted many of our amendments and put it beyond doubt that the scheme would be completely voluntary-one of the things that Mr Brown was concerned about-while at the same time retaining the essence of a withholding tax where the tax payer chose not to quote his or her tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Mr Neil Brown for conducting extensive negotiations with Senator Tate over the privacy legislation which has resulted, in my opinion, in the determination of adequate safeguards under the tax file number system. This system, as it now stands, after a series of amendments, does not threaten the civil liberties of any individual to any degree. Under the guidelines that have now been agreed to, people will have a tax file number which is not to be used as a national identification system by whatever means. The tax file number recipients are not to use the information for matching personal information about a person. They are not to use the information for unauthorised purposes such as the building up of a database on individuals or the cross-matching of information for non-tax purposes. Government agencies may not disclose tax file number information for cross-matching without parliamentary approval. </PARA>
<PARA> All these amendments, which Mr Brown brought in with the concurrence of the Government, have made this Bill a much better Bill than it was in the first instance. I am sure that many Australian citizens would be pleased to hear that a large number of Australians will not need to register for a tax file number at all. This legislation will go a long way towards catching some of the tax cheats in the community. I refer to another area that Mr Brown has made sure is covered properly. There are many people and numerous financial transactions and accounts in respect of which no quotation of the tax file number will be required. For example, it will not be necessary to use the tax file numbers for loan accounts of all descriptions, including mortgages, credit cards and leases. For existing-and I emphasise the word `existing'-interest-bearing accounts with banks, building societies and credit unions where the interest paid or credited each year remains below $120, it will not be needed. It is understood that about 70 per cent of accounts with building societies and credit unions fall below this level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about the question of self-government in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I am greatly disappointed that I have to rise to discuss it tonight because like many other people here in Canberra I had hoped that the matter could be discussed and resolved tomorrow. But now we have the situation where, as a consequence of decisions of the Australian Democrats and the Opposition parties, the Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Clyde Holding, has today issued a press release headed `ACT self-government in jeopardy'. He has said that the progress towards self-government has been placed in jeopardy and he is seeking urgent discussions to try to resolve it. I do not blame the Minister for that. I understand the circumstances that have led him to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had a situation for a lengthy period in which the Democrats have, under the guise of negotiation, refused to budge at all. We have had the situation where it has been extremely difficult for the Minister to find out what the policy of the Opposition parties has been, is or will be. I want to say a few things to those parties. I am not clear, after reading reports and hearing the news, about the position of the Opposition parties, although I am disappointed about the adjournment. I want to say to them, if it applies-and certainly to the Democrats-something about what I think needs to happen in the political negotiations. I have been involved in the business of political negotiations for a very long time. It seems to me that there are some things which some people have not learnt. One is that if one is negotiating one has to shift one's position from time to time. I found the frustration-and I know of two Ministers in the time that I have been here who have had the same concern-that each time the Labor Government makes concessions that concession is swallowed up. People say, `Thank you very much' and then reiterate their original position. They think that because they keep smiling while they are doing that that is what is called negotiation. It is only the 1986 butcher of self-government with a smiling face. </PARA>
<PARA> The original position of the Labor Government was for single member constituencies. That proved to be unacceptable so we made a concession and offered what became known as the Mackerras model, a combination of the House of Representatives and Senate models in one chamber. That was unacceptable and self-government was butchered. In 1988 we have the Government coming up with the proposed d'Hondt electoral system, then modifying it and modifying it again to meet various concerns and queries that have been raised. In all that time no agreement has been reached and there has been no indication that any movement at all from the other side is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the statement made by the then Minister for Territories, Mr Gary Punch. He said, `We have shifted a mile on this; all we are asking you to do is come towards us one inch'. That remains the situation today. The alternative situation that is proposed, which is that the whole of the Assembly should be elected under the Senate system, can lead to the situation in a small chamber of 17 where the person with the sort of vote that former Senator Wood received-1.5 per cent of the vote-could wind up being the de facto government of the ACT, holding the balance of power. After the last Australian Capital Territory election held under that system the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, who was the leader on the Liberal ticket, received 25 per cent of the vote at that election. That is not a circumstance that I think is a reasonable proposition or something that the people of the ACT would lightly accept. The sort of instability that may well arise would give self-government in the Australian Capital Territory a bad name. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some outrageous allegations made about the reasons why the Government is supporting the d'Hondt electoral system. I want to say only two things. Firstly, it is not the Labour Party's or the Government's preferred position. Our preferred position is single member constituencies. It is as far as we feel we can go towards balancing the reasonable objectives of having the composition of the Parliament reflect the wishes of the voters-which various other systems do but this does also-while creating the pre-conditions for a stable government that can give the people of the Australian Capital Territory the sort of government they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to warn those involved that although self-government has not had a stronger advocate than myself in the Australian Capital Territory-I supported it when I was the only one and I continue to support it in my Party and publicly-the people who are purporting to negotiate ought to remember that I do not support and no one in the Labour Party supports self-government at any price. They should not think that we can be forced to accept what we have said is unacceptable. We will go a long way. We have gone a long way. If there is no possibility of getting self-government with an electoral system that allows for stable government and reasonable representation I would support the view that the Labor Government should not proceed with the legislation. If we did we would have a tragedy, a re-run of 1986. I hope it never happens. I hope that good sense will prevail. I want to say to people that they should not take the flexibility and tolerance of the Government as a sign of weakness. They should not believe that because we have made a lot of concessions there are a lot more to come. We have almost reached the bottom of the barrel, if we have not already. I urge those people who are responsible in the other parties represented in this chamber to consider that and to come forward to accept a proposal for a reasonable compromise between the interests of all the parties that protects the best interests of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that can be reflected in the very early passage of a reasonable and agreed self-government package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to speak on another matter on the adjournment but I cannot let the remarks made by Senator McMullan pass without comment. He says that the self-government situation is in jeopardy. I find that totally surprising. I had taken the view at one time that the Australian Labor Party was not serious about self-government although in more recent times I have come to the view that it was. But with the threats that are being suggested now it makes me wonder whether I have been on the wrong path. Maybe Senator McMullan was not referring to the Liberal Party. I would hope that that would be the case because that would make more sense. Senator McMullan must know that only about 24 hours ago I-and I assume he and others-was handed a stack of amendments from the Australian Democrats. This was a pile of papers about an inch thick. This morning we were told that there are more amendments to come. I know that the Labor Party pushes legislation through the House of Representatives with absolutely no scrutiny whatsoever of any consequence but that is not the way we do things in the Senate. It would be irresponsible of all of us not to look at the amendments that are being proposed and not to look at all aspects of this very important matter which we are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking of setting up a government in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). That is a matter which the Liberal Party is very strongly committed to and has been for a long time. We are equally determined to see that we set up something that is of value to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, it includes the electoral system. That is important, as Senator McMullan knows, as he referred to it. I shall come back to that. It includes a whole range of other activities and functions as well. The manner in which they are handed over needs to be looked at very carefully. For the consequence of what we are doing we have not had this legislation from the Government for very long at all. In regard to the electoral system Senator McMullan quoted the former Minister saying that the Labor Party had given a mile and all we had to do was give an inch. I do not know how we measure a mile or an inch in these terms. I also recognise that the single member electorate was the position from which the Labor Party first started. I take the view that it is important that we get an electoral system which reflects the views of the voters of the Australian Capital Territory. To best do that one would certainly look at the Senate electoral system. The Labor Party rejects that and we have been looking very closely at the modification of the d'Hondt system that the Government says it will now agree to. I believe an arrangement can be arrived at whereby the electoral system can be sorted out. It is not something that one just throws into the ring. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be surprised if Senator McMullan has not read sufficient material in the Canberra Times in recent weeks and months to know of the anxiety and concerns felt by a number of expert people about the electoral system and the fact that those with a small number of votes will be wiped out altogether. I recognise what he says the Labor Party is trying to do and Senator McMullan should recognise the Opposition's concerns on this matter. We have shifted a considerable degree in looking at the system as it now is. He knows that it has been modified significantly since the d'Hondt system proposal-a system which was strongly rejected by the electorate when it came up in the first place. I find this a funny place to be told about how we should go about negotiating, but again perhaps I will give the honourable senator the benefit of the doubt that he is not talking about us. I believe that we have been looking carefully and closely at the legislation which the Government has brought forward. We have looked very closely at the massive volume of legislation that the Democrats have brought forward this week. We do not take the view that it should be rejected out of hand and not looked at at all. It may be that we will reject it, but I believe that we should read it first. I was surprised that it arose tonight in this fashion, but as the President did not rule the matter out of order, I thought that I, too, should respond. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to come to the matter on which I intended to speak briefly this evening. I refer to the awarding today to the Australian Capital Territory finalists of the Australian Small Business Awards for 1988, which took place at the Hermitage Restaurant at Woden Plaza. The Australian Small Business Awards have now been going for some years, and until now have been run by the Department of Industry. They are now run by the private sector. The major sponsors for the Australian awards are the ANZ Bank, Australian Airlines and TNT. Locally there are sponsors-Light'n Easy Radio 1053, Thomas Cook Travel, the Commonwealth Government Bookshop, Video Channel and the Canberra Times. </PARA>
<PARA> There were three sections to the awards that were made today, and the presentation was made by the Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding. The first section, to a small business, was to the Gallery Bookshop. In the second section, for non-manufacturing, there were two certificates of commendation to Stratagem Computer Contractors and The Battery Factory. The winner in that section was Canberra Wholesale Stationers Pty Ltd. There was a third section of manufacturing and again there was a certificate of commendation to Kendon Industries Pty Ltd. The winner in that section was Spectrum Joinery. These businesses are doing well in the ACT and are to be congratulated on their success. I wish them well when they come to the final of the Australian Small Business Awards and hope that they will be successful.</PARA>
<PARA> The awards now are substantially run by the Small Business Bureau of the Canberra Development Board, and the judging of those who entered was provided from the Fyshwick Chamber of Commerce and the Canberra Development Board. In addition today, Mr Donald Allan, the National Executive Director of Young Achievement Australia, presented an award to the school of the ACT which was the outstanding school in the Young Achievement Award. This is a program with which all senators will be familiar-a program which has grown and which seeks to show young people what business is about and how to run and manage a business. I understand that in Australia this year there were 260 projects comprising about 5,000 young people. The winner in the ACT was Radford College, which entered the competition under the Youth Australia Radford College 1988 section. The school won $2,000 in book vouchers, and each student in the group also received a $20 book voucher. I commend those who devoted themselves to the young achievement program and think it is very worth while, as also is the Small Business Award program. I congratulate the ACT finalists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the new President of the United States of America, George Bush. It was a long-time predicted result, but in politics, as we all know, the show is never over until the fat lady sings. That is how George Bush ran his campaign. Michael Dukakis ran a very fine and fast finishing campaign. We in Australia must now look forward to the Bush years and there are many challenges ahead, such as the United States debt situation and the continuing peace negotiations. I wish George Bush all the best, and also extend best wishes to the Reagans as their term ends and they prepare for the Bush years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Reagan years were most extraordinary and in many ways very enjoyable years. One of the most extraordinary factors of the Reagan years is that Ronald Reagan is leaving his presidency more popular than when he entered it. I do not think that there has been a United States president to match that. Some of the highlights I recall in the Reagan years were the Challenger disaster, the Lebanon suicide bombing and the Normandy Day memorial speech. It is probably a reflection of his great presidency that President Reagan was able to respond to crisis with great control and calm, always reassuring his nation and the world. Few leaders can say that they have that gift. The world does not often produce great leaders. Ronald Reagan was one, as history will bear out. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) When the new Departmental structure was introduced following Machinery of Government changes of July 1987, all but 11 SES officers were placed at their substantive levels within the new Departmental structure. No SES officers became unattached from statutory authorities within my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Nil</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 3</PARA>
<PARA> (d) $41,787 (this figure does not include Recreation and Long Service Leave payments in lieu, or superannuation benefits)</PARA>
<PARA> (e) 53; 59; 56 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Introduction of the new Departmental structure, as a result of the July 1987 Machinery of Government changes, involved abolition of most of the affected clerical structures in the old Departments and creation of new replacement structures. This meant a large number of clerical staff were unattached but the majority were placed in the new structure. The following details show the end result of this process.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) There are currently 200 unattached officers within the Department, of whom 27, including 2 technical officers, remain unattached as a result of implementing the new Departmental structure. The remaining unattached officers are part of the normal unattachment list carried by all APS departments.</PARA>
<PARA> Three officers became unattached within statutory authorities within my area of portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Nil</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 4</PARA>
<PARA> (d) $15,350</PARA>
<PARA> (e) 19; 25; 32; 63.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Counselling, on-the-job training and trial placements are part of the normal redeployment process for individual officers identified as unattached and it is expected that officers currently unattached will be absorbed into Departmental positions within a reasonable period. Following implementation of the new Departmental structure, the Department instituted a policy whereby all positions to which permanent recruitment is proposed are first canvassed through internal circulars, for possible filling by an unattached officer.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Staffing for the Department increased from 4799 at 11 July 1987 to 4939 at 30 June 1988. The increase is related to the transfer of 287 staff from the Victorian Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in April 1988 when the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service assumed responsibility for domestic meat inspection in that State. After allowance is made for the transfer of these staff the Department has effectively reduced staffing in this period by 147. Included in this reduction is a net saving of 15 SES staff.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a net saving of 11 full-time positions and 1 part-time (3 days per week) position in statutory authorities within my area of portfolio responsibility, in the period from July 1987.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A toll free number was not listed for Brisbane. Inquiries from outside the Brisbane area were required to use an STD number.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) recognises the value and importance of providing a toll-free inquiry service for non-metropolitan residents. A detailed study of toll-free telephone requirements was undertaken in late 1987 for the purpose of identifying deficiencies in the provision of the service and to provide a basis for allocating funds for remedial action. At that time a number of Branch Offices already had toll-free telephones in use but others, including Brisbane Office, did not.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the ATO to upgrade the service progressively so that all country taxpayers have access to the same facilities as people residing within the local call areas of Branch and Regional Offices.</PARA>
<PARA> The installation of the service in the Brisbane Office is currently the highest priority of the outstanding recommendations contained in the 1987 study and will be effected as soon as funds permit.</PARA>
