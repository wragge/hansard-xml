Did the briefing include the arrangement proposed for the purchase of poker machines for the Club? At the time of receipt of the briefing, or at any time thereafter, but prior to the issue being raised in Senate Estimates Committee E, did the Minister express or indicate any reservations about the funding arrangements proposed for the Woden Town Club?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. How much revenue does the Government expect to raise from the planned removal of the special income tax exemption currently enjoyed by the goldmining industry? Secondly, can the Minister provide the Senate with any information regarding the distributional implications of that measure?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2173" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the May economic statement the estimate was published that the revenue to be derived from the ending of the tax exemption for gold would be around $70m in the financial year 1991-92 and around $300m per year thereafter. As far as I know, there is no good reason to substantially vary those estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two pieces of information about the distribution which I think it is important to stress. The first is that a substantial beneficiary of the present arrangements is the United States Treasury. Some 35 per cent or 36 per cent of the Australian goldmining industry is in foreign ownership, or was in 1984-85, and the great majority of that in the United States. Because the United States is a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement, tax which would otherwise have been paid by a US company operating in Australia, but which was not paid, is automatically levied by the United States Treasury, and the present arrangements transfer from the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia up to, or as much as, $70m to the United States Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of historical record that the Reagan Administration did a considerable amount of economic damage in the United States, but it has not yet made the United States a Third World country deserving of foreign aid. That is what the present gold taxation arrangements amount to. It is a foreign aid program from Australia to the United States, among other things. Up to $70m--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are getting foreign aid to the extent of $150m a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know very well what the honourable senator's private views are on this matter. Senator Stone believes, exactly as I do, that the present arrangements for the exemption of the goldmining industry from taxation are an outrage. He believed that throughout his career in the Treasury, and it is one of the things he has always been correct about. The $70m is particularly relevant in view of the letter which the Leader of the Opposition wrote on this subject a bit over 12 months ago, when he said, `We have a particular concern about the effect a gold tax would have on our balance of payments'. Well, the effect of not having one, of exempting goldmining from ordinary company taxation, is to add $70m or there- abouts to our current account deficit, the $70m of revenue which is still collected from the companies concerned but which is collected in Washington instead of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other beneficiary of the existing arrangements is Elders IXL Ltd. In the Age of 5 October this year Elder IXL inserted an advertisement which stated, `Elders Resources is now among the top ten gold producers in Australia'. So Elders IXL will have to pay some tax in the future which it has not paid in the past, just as those American companies which hold equity in Australian goldmines will have to pay their tax in future in Australia instead of paying it in Washington, which will take that amount off our current account deficit and our foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA> I was hoping-I suppose I should have known better-that even as late as this morning commonsense and some commitment to consistency, sense, or dare I say, even patriotism would have broken out in the Opposition Party room meeting and that it might have rolled the executive. Unfortunately, I understand that is not so. But it is still irrelevant because I believe the Australian Democrats will be supporting the Government's measure as, of course, they should because not even the Democrats fall for the self-interested bleating of companies such as Elders Resources Ltd and those assorted spivs in Western Australia who have been running this campaign for as long as anybody can remember, but running it particularly virulently over the last two or three years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is interesting that one of the so-called wets of the Liberal Party is asking this question. I wonder-although I would not embarrass him by asking-what Senator Peter Baume's view is on this question. The important thing to realise when one is standing up for the recognition of the status of women is what women regard as important in the public arena. What women regard as important in the private arena, that is, in the privacy of their own homes and in their relationships with their partners, is entirely a matter for those women. I see no contradiction whatsoever in representing the needs and aspirations of Australian women in terms of public policy and leaving those decisions that relate to privacy entirely to Australian women. I think it is interesting that this question should come from a so-called small `l' liberal. Given the debate on the Australia Card and the importance of privacy, it is rather surprising that Senator Hill would be the one to raise this question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Recent articles in the press-in particular, one in the Age of 19 October this year headed `Swings and Roundabouts'-have described problems of waste disposal around the world and some very strange, if not very scary, proposals to deal with it. Can the Minister tell the Senate what processes or proposals are in place in this country to deal with Australian waste, particularly industrial chemical waste, and what consultations have taken place with the State governments to ensure that industrial chemical waste is being handled in an environmentally secure manner?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2174" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give Senator Crowley some idea of that. Australia's obligations in respect of dealing with chemical waste derive mainly from our being a party to the London Dumping Convention, which is the International Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. We have given effect to that by the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act, which, hopefully, successfully monitors our dumping of waste. The States have been extensively consulted over that legislation. Provision is made in the legislation for arrangements to be made allowing States to administer sea dumping in accordance with the terms of the Convention. The terms of the Convention are reasonably strict, and they apply within the coastal waters of each State. That is the provision that exists. So far no arrangements are in place, but the exchange of memoranda of understanding that we are about to sign with Tasmania will be a great leap forward, and hopefully we can follow on with other States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one goes away from the sea and looks at what we do on land, the important thing to look at is intractable wastes, which present quite a problem. There has for some time been consultation between the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth on the siting of an incinerator which can deal with intractable wastes. It seems that the logical thing to do-and the Australian Environment Council has been looking at it for some years-is to site such a facility on the east coast where most of the chemicals to which Senator Crowley is referring would be either produced or used. The first draft of a report from that committee will be released shortly, but having talked about it with the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Mr Moore, only a few weeks ago, I think it is reasonable to say that we are getting very close to naming the site where we can establish our incinerator.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. As the Minister is no doubt aware, a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Mr Justice Staples, has been given no work on the Commission since 1986 and very little prior to that since 1980. As no action has been taken to remove Mr Justice Staples from his office in accordance with normal procedures, can the Minister explain why the Deputy President has been treated in this way, bearing in mind that Mr Justice Staples has repeatedly stated his willingness to fulfil the duties of his office? Does the Minister agree, or would he if he were allowed to, that this disgraceful, longstanding state of affairs warrants an inquiry? Is the Government willing to accede to Mr Justice Staples's request that a joint select committee be established to conduct such an inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2175" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most other senators I understand the question because Mr Justice Staples wrote to members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives quite recently. I understand that the position is largely as the honourable senator describes it. However, the Government does not support the idea of a parliamentary inquiry into this matter. There are a number of reasons for that and a number of considerations need to be borne in mind. The independence of the judiciary is a long established principle in democratic countries which observe the doctrine of separation of powers. This is enshrined in the Constitution which, amongst other things, limits how and in what circumstances a judge may be removed from office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under section 72 of the Constitution Federal judges may not be removed, except by the Governor-General in Council on an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. There are a number of good reasons why this should be so. Basically, they are that confidence in the judicial system depends on its actual and perceived independence. I make the point that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is not a court for the purposes of the Constitution.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or any other purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even so, it is self-evident that the Commission, which deals with such vitally important and sensitive matters in the area of labour relations, should have its independence protected. Senator Stone's interjection might have come later. Anything else would undermine its authority and effectiveness. Parliament has accordingly provided under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 for presidential members to have the same rank, status and precedence as a judge of the Federal Court. Legally qualified members such as Mr Justice Staples have the designation of a judge. More importantly, the Act also provides that presidential members are only to be removed in the same way and on the same grounds as apply to a Federal judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, just as such courts are responsible for the arrangement of their business, the Commission is responsible for the organisation of its work. For example, the Chief Judge of the Federal Court of Australia is empowered to arrange for the constitution of the court with the hearing of matters before it. Similarly, the President of the Arbitration Commission is responsible for the allocation of matters before the Commission. Neither the Parliament nor the Executive, in the Government's view, should interfere with this process unless there are clear grounds for questioning whether any basis exists for the removal of the holder of an office for proved misbehaviour or incapacity. These are the criteria. That is not the case here and there is no useful purpose to be served by a parliamentary inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines is quite right to say that this is not an issue of such compelling importance as to lead the Government into suggesting an amendment to the Constitution. There would be very obvious sensitivities in such a proposal which would have an impact on the independence of the judiciary as a whole. I believe there would be no advantage in taking that step even if it were felt that a Constitutional referendum were justified. In regard to the further part of Senator Haines's question as to what might be done about Mr Justice Staples's position, let me say that I believe it to be unique in the judiciary in Australia at present, and I have nothing to add to what I said in the earlier part of my answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The deliberations of the Caucus this morning are a matter for members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, but I think it is proper for me to indicate that the real concerns of the majority of the Parliamentary Labor Party in that Caucus were of a more positive kind. What came through in the discussions was a real concern that out in the community there was a confusion and a misunderstanding of what exactly fell into the category of X-rated videos, particularly compared with R-rated videos. Indeed, I know from correspondence that I have received and certainly from conversations I have had out in the community that many members of the community do not understand that X-rated material deals with explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults, certainly not children, but does not include any depiction suggesting coercion or non-consent of any kind. Senators would agree that out in the community, as one talks to people or as people make representations, there is indeed a confusion whereby the question of violence invariably comes into the conversation. Many of those with whom members and senators have conversations seem to think that in X-rated videos there is a depiction of violence, which is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that situation the Parliamentary Labor Party considered that it would be best serving the community at this stage if it sought not only a clarification for the benefit of the community of those distinctions between X-rated and R-rated videos, but also sought to improve and tighten up the regulations relating to the depiction of violence in videos. Indeed, I believe the community would be well served by a focused attention being given to the question of the depiction of violence in videos. I know from the setting up of the National Committee on Violence, which attracted some publicity some three or four weeks ago, that most of the positive letters and remarks I have heard concerning the committee's examination of violence had to do with the possibility of that committee suggesting ways in which the depiction of violence could be eradicated from so much of the viewing of particularly young people who are at a formative stage. It is in relation to that confusion that I believe the decision of the Parliamentary Labor Party needs to be put in context.</PARA>

Is that the basis of this morning's recommendation? I ask the Minister to respond to my questions, which he has not responded to: Firstly, is it a fact that in the Government's own legislation this material is described officially as hard-core pornography, and, secondly, is it a fact that the decision that was taken in effect is the rejection of the request by all the States that this material be refused classification for the home video entertainment market?</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it a fact that although Mr Kalejs is an Australian citizen, he has been a resident of the US for nearly 30 years? Has the Australian Government requested his extradition? Has there been any communication with the American Office of Special Investigations by the Government or any of its agencies concerning the timing of the deportation order? Does the Minister know why the United States is deporting Mr Kalejs rather than trying him in the United States for his alleged war crimes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Konrad Kalejs has been a resident in the United States since 1959 but, as I understand it, he was granted Australian citizenship in August 1957. It is a fact that he has been found in United States deportation proceedings to have assisted in the persecution of Jewish and other civilians while a member of the Arajs Kommando in nazi-occupied Latvia. This allegation was dealt with by Mr Menzies at pages 102 to 103 of his published report on the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia. Senator Hamer asked whether the Australian Government has sought the extradition of Mr Kalejs. I believe that that shows a misunderstanding. It is the United States authorities which are seeking to deport Mr Kalejs. That seems to be the way in which the United States Government has chosen to deal with the presence of suspected war criminals in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be emphasised-obviously, I do not want to do anything that would be prejudicial to Mr Kalejs should he be deported and returned to Australia-that United States deportation proceedings are civil in nature and the standard of proof is accordingly different from that which would apply under our proposed legislation where the standard is a criminal one requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. It is important, for Mr Kalejs's sake, if you like, to emphasise those two different standards of proof and the fact that any trial to be conducted in Australia under the proposed legislation-that is, the War Crimes Amendment Bill, which is before the Senate at the moment-would be conducted in a quite different way according to the ordinary standards of proof pertaining to criminal trials in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer asked whether there has been any discussion between government agencies both in the United States and Australia as to the timing of the deportation proceedings. I have no information as to that. I will seek to find an answer, if indeed there is one. But I would imagine that the matter has been dealt with in the normal processes of the United States judicial procedures.</PARA>

I refer to the Minister's statement that the United States has chosen to deport suspected war criminals rather than put them on trial. Is it not a fact that the United States has no war crimes Act, and is not proposing to have one for legal and constitutional reasons; and that it is not prepared to enact a retrospective law allowing United States courts to try alleged crimes committed in foreign countries against non-Americans? Are not the Americans unwilling to try war criminals themselves, instead of deporting alleged war criminals for trial in countries which do not have the same restraints?</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite clearly that differs from the point of view of the Australian Government. Indeed, rather than Australia deporting those in our midst who have allegations made against them-and certain suspects are said to be in this country, as was indicated by Mr Menzies in his report-to jurisdictions where the criminal justice system is not as adequate as ours, it has been the decision of the Australian Government that such persons should be tried in Australian courts, but according to the very same principles and standards as would apply in any other criminal trial held in an Australian jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government recognises that where homelessness occurs it is usually a symptom of a more serious problem. It maybe a problem associated with chronic unemployment in some form, extended illness, domestic violence, family breakdown or something of that nature. Because of the Government's recognition of that problem we introduced in 1984-85 the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program. I point out that the Fraser Government did not have a similar sort of program to help vulnerable people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not rubbish; them's the facts. The honourable senator might find it very inconvenient for those facts to be publicly revealed; nonetheless, publicly revealed they are. We reviewed the supported accommodation assistance program and on 3 November the Prime Minister, together with the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, announced a new package which will offer $40m to the States over the next three years, on top of the record expenditure that we are already providing. That extra money will enable 150 new services to be instituted over the next three years. It will assist over 15,000 people in need and it is aimed at stabilising people's lives and putting them back on their feet so that they can go on in the community. It is a priority of this Government under the social justice strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question, which I regard as another free kick in the square or a full toss down the leg side, emphasises the point I was making yesterday: these tax bludgers in the gold mining industry, who have bludged on the rest of Australian industry, which pays company tax, and bludged on the rest of the Australian taxpayers, probably with the exception of a few in the Liberal Party, have polluted Australian politics for as long as anybody can remember.

<PARA> I am very grateful to Senator Durack for asking this question because I have in front of me a comment piece written by the Senate leader, Senator Chaney, which appeared in the Australian of Friday, 17 February 1984. It is a comment piece, not something that is said by some politician who gets backed or painted into a corner or is bailed up by the press and, having a microphone shoved down his neck, is asked, `What do you think of this?'. This is a comment piece-it was volunteered. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The special taxation situation of the gold industry is one of those features of Australian tax law which is not distinguished by its economic logic.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a mild understatement. It is somewhat of an understatement which in the next couple of paragraphs he corrected, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Since gold no longer has any particular monetary significance, it is a commodity like any other, its price being determined by the market.</PARA>

I am very grateful to whichever member of the Opposition it was who sent that to me. I invite someone in the Opposition to send me another anonymous note about whether the position that Senator Chaney adopted in the party room and at the executive meeting was the one he put forward in 1984 or the politically oppportunistic proposition for which the majority of the Liberal Party and, so far as its Western Australian members are concerned, under duress from the spivs and bludgers who have been running this campaign in Western Australia in a particularly virulent way in the last few years--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I draw the Minister's attention to recent statements made by two well respected Australian Labor Party backbenchers, John Langmore and Gordon Bilney, calling on the Government to make a fresh start in its policies on poverty in the Third World by at least lifting aid to the level it was at when Labor took office. Given that the level of aid was then 0.51 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), that the Government originally promised to increase aid to the United Nations' recommended target of 0.7 per cent of GDP and that currently it is 0.36 per cent of GDP, is the Government now prepared to adopt a new strategy and start to significantly increase aid levels? I also ask whether the Minister is considering Mr Langmore's suggestion of making a comprehensive annual statement to Parliament on the Third World and, with the Treasurer, of getting Australia to play a more significant role in advocating new policies for handling Third World debt. Finally, I ask whether the Minister has read Mr Langmore's article on overseas aid in the Australian Financial Review of 31 October? Does he agree with the proposal that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) should be added to his portfolio and that Australia, like most other Western countries, could also have a Ministry for overseas development.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be appreciated that there is substantial provision for aid in the 1988-89 Budget-in fact, for $1,093.5m worth. That is an increase of 1.2 per cent in real terms on 1987-88. It creates a situation where outlays are 0.36 per cent of gross national product, which is slightly above the average for developed country donors which are members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is not to say that it is necessarily a figure that I am comfortable with or completely happy with or would not wish to see increased. But let us put it in perspective and acknowledge that this this is the first real increase in the aid budget since 1984-85 and it does, in fact, constitute a bottoming out of recent aid budget declines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the general issue of poverty is concerned AIDAB has embarked on a study of ways to enhance the focus of poverty in the aid program. As announced by my predecessor at the World Development Debate in July, AIDAB is involving the Australian Council for Overseas Aid in that study. On the question of debt, to which Senator Vallentine referred, the Government supports the case by case kind of growth oriented strategy for debt resolution, noting that each situation should continue to be handled with care, showing sensitivity to effect on the well-being of low income groups. In this respect, we certainly endorse the catalytic role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the debt resolution process. I have taken seriously the suggestion of my colleague Mr Langmore. There are some attractions in principle with his proposal for a comprehensive annual statement on aid and its implications for world poverty. Certainly I will give consideration to following that suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the view in the article-at least in the form in which it was printed; I do not know whether it is in the form in which it was written-that Senator Vallentine has picked up with alacrity that AIDAB should become part of my portfolio, it is the case that it is already part of my portfolio and has been from the outset. I do not think that a separate aid Ministry is a realistic proposition, certainly not in an environment where we are engaged, in the interest of rational public administration, in amalgamating Ministries rather than further splitting them apart. Moreover, the provision of overseas aid is an integral part of any country's foreign policy. Its administration by a separate bureau within my Department ensures that it does nonetheless receive the kind of individual attention, both in policy and in administration, that something of this significance deserves. It also ensures that aid issues receive the priority the Government certainly attaches to the important humanitarian issues that are involved in them.</PARA>

Does he accept that the fact that there have been at least 13 further deaths in custody since the commencement of the Muirhead inquiry suggests that all is not well and that a difficult situation is, if anything, getting worse? Does he accept that the decline in Aboriginal employment is an indication that policies are not effective?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think it is a sign of success; I think it is a great human tragedy, and it was this Government which addressed the matter by setting up a royal commission in order to inquire into not only the particular deaths involved but the underlying causes, and it is in relation to that fuller report by Mr Justice Muirhead that I expect that we would as an Australian community-with the support of the Federal Government, but at its initiative, and the State governments and the Northern Territory Government-reach a situation where those deaths of fellow Australians in custody and in detention will not occur with the same frequency and in the same way as it appears that they have been and are-yes, tragically-still occurring. Indeed, it is this Government, not only by setting up the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, but through other mechanisms such as the Australian Police Ministers Council, which has taken the initiative in addressing a problem which has been a shameful state of affairs in Australian society over many years, but particularly in the last several years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, Senator Chaney made some point about the typographical error in an answer in the Daily Hansard. I hope that Hansard will correct that. I regard that as a completely trivial matter and I hope that it will be remedied to give the full sense obviously of the whole of the preceding answer. Senator Chaney pointed out that several inquiries are being undertaken, including the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not only legislation; it is a wider inquiry than that, Senator. The Committee is a forum in which many of the sorts of matters which the honourable senator says should be raised can obviously be raised, because what he is talking about and alleging is widespread and gross maladministration, mismanagement and even corruption in a way which leads to a very severe detrimental impact on the Aboriginal community of Australia. Having sat through the various hours upon hours of Estimates committee hearings into the expenditures under the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, I must say that whilst areas of concern were raised and in some instances correctly emphasised as matters that ought to be a cause of concern and further investigated-that is what the Government has undertaken to do with no stone unturned in those investigations-nevertheless, what was also portrayed was a very genuine effort by this Government to help many of the Aboriginal communities around Australia in their desired to achieve a healthy, productive, self-determining situation which has been not their lot due to many decades-indeed two centuries-of mistreatment and neglect. Much of the expenditure under the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio has been very well focused and properly directed to the Aboriginal people and the improvement of their situation within our Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, whilst indeed there have been some programs which have gone astray and where the impact of certain policies and programs has not been such as to bear the fruit that might have been desired by those initiating or undertaking them, nevertheless I do not think it is fair to paint a picture of this Government or, indeed, preceding Federal governments-after all, this is a process where one builds on the achievements of preceding governments-as having not shown a commitment which in many instances has brought about an improvement in the situation of many Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. As in his answer yesterday, the Minister diverted the question onto the issue of maladministration. My question did not relate to maladministration, it related to failures of policy. It is not being claimed by the Opposition that all policy is being maladministered. Clearly there are areas where it is not, but there are many apparent policy failures. I ask the Minister: To which of the Government inquiries does he say evidence can appropriately be directed, not on maladministration but policy failure?</PARA></TALK.START>

For him to say that I have not been alert to the fact that the whole debate has been about policy over the last few weeks, I believe misrepresents the situation as it has developed, and which has been the focus of community and parliamentary attention over the last few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Policy matters have a forum, I believe, in the Senate Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which is looking at the very fundamental policy of how we as a community provide for the special needs and opportunities which will improve the lot of the Aboriginal people of Australia. There is one very obvious forum, and it is perhaps best that the fundamental questions of policy are thrashed out in the committees of this Parliament and in the parliamentary chamber itself. The Government has undertaken the fullest possible inquiries, in relation to the implementation of policy, and they will be undertaken with vigour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer the last question with a very affirmative response, because in a person such as Barney Cooney, who has taken a very keen interest in community legal centres since their inception, not only in Victoria but around Australia, those legal centres have a most able advocate. For example, at meetings of the Caucus legal and administrative committee he continually puts their case in a most vigorous way. In the last Budget an amount of $2,355,000 was allocated, and this represents an increase of 5.8 per cent on the preceding year's Budget. I must say that the Minister for Finance has played his part in ensuring that these centres maintain their ability to provide a very important service to the persons in the community whom they serve by being placed in those centres of population where access to legal advice is not otherwise readily available, and certainly not in the friendly, accessible and low cost way in which it is available from the 59 community legal centres throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tremendously dedicated work is undertaken in those centres by the members of the community legal centres who are employed either full time or part time. They provide an opportunity and a venue for legal practitioners to provide free advice through many hours of voluntary service as professionals. So the money put in by the Commonwealth and matched, sometimes only in part-in some instances it is not matched at all-by State legal aid commissions, is multiplied many times by the legal practitioners' services which are provided free of charge within the venue. The dedicated workers at these community legal centres not only provide advice in a way which is most appropriate to those who come in their doors, whether it is about tenancy or other matters, but also they produce booklets and easy guides to the law with are also of great use to persons in the community. All in all, the community legal centres provide a very important part of fulfilling the social justice strategy of the Australian Labor Party and, within the legal aid provisions of the Attorney-General's portfolio, I believe they have a most significant role to play.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-During Question Time Senator Walsh chose to quote a couple of sentences out of an article which I wrote on 17 February 1984 and which was published in the Australian newspaper on the subject of a tax on goldmining. The paragraph he quoted included the sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The special taxation situation of the gold industry is one of those features of Australian tax law which is not distinguished by its economic logic. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, Senator Walsh left out a great deal of what I had to say, including the words which preceded that sentence, in which I quoted Sir Charles Court as once suggesting that not all problems were solved by logic. In that article I quoted Senator Walsh and a then recent statement of his on the issue of gold, and I would like to read a number of those sentences. I said, after quoting Senator Walsh as saying that there was negligible rational economic justification for gold's tax-free status:</PARA>
<PARA>Yet he also remarked subjecting gold to normal corporate taxation would nearly halve the return on shareholders' funds, investment would fall, and employment may be prejudiced. He went on to say, without commitment, a rent tax on gold would not affect investment. </PARA>
<PARA>I wrote, a few sentences later:</PARA>
<PARA>The key thing which must be borne in mind is that under any rational tax regime investors and producers should have some guarantee of consistency and predictability. That is particularly true of gold where there has been substantial new investment in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There are strong arguments against changing the rules in a way which would invalidate investment decisions taken in good faith on the basis of the existing rules. </PARA>
<PARA>After some discussion about the alternatives that were available, I finished the article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, rigorous logic might lead them-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the rationalists in the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>in another direction altogether. For if the privileged tax status of gold mining is maintained to preserve investment, profit and employment, why logically should we not increase investment, profit and employment in the rest of the mining sector by reducing taxation? Some will see that as a logical reductio ad absurdum, but it's not as silly as it sounds. </PARA>
<PARA>When one hears those additional passages which, as I say, not surprisingly were not quoted by Senator Walsh because they would have spoilt his misrepresentation of what I had written, it is quite clear that the case I was putting was one which canvassed those matters but which made it quite clear that there are arguments both in terms of not invalidating existing investment decisions and in terms of maintaining investment, profit and employment. It is fairly typical of Senator Walsh that he quoted so selectively from that article. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Australian National Gallery for 1987-88 records the very considerable success which the Australian National Gallery had last year. It indicates, for example, that the highest ever attendance was achieved at the Gallery's travelling exhibitions throughout Australia. It indicates the successful launch of the Australian National Gallery Foundation and its receipt of almost $2.5m in donations and pledges. I understand that, in one of the taxation Bills to come before the chamber shortly, tax deductability will be provided for donations to that fund. It indicates the staging of the fourth major international exhibition, attracting almost 350,000 visitors to the three venues around Australia, the acquisition through purchase and donation of over 2,000 works of art for the national collection and the generation of over $3m from merchandise sales. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to indicate the flow-on effect that activities such as those undertaken by the Australian National Gallery have for the Australian Capital Territory. For example, the Old Masters-New Visions exhibition, which was part of the Phillips Collection, drew more visitors to its eight weeks showing in Canberra than any travelling display of that collection in the United States of America. It generated over $20m additional tourist expenditure to the national capital during the course of its eight weeks visit. I think it is interesting therefore to put this within the context of the way in which this Government has been effectively starving and crippling the development of museums and national collecting institutions through the uncertainty introduced as a result of the internal secret review of museums and collecting institutions undertaken jointly by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Department of Finance. It is all very well for colleagues on the Australian Labor Party side, such as Senator McMullan, to indicate the extent to which they are great supporters of the National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia when, in fact, it is the deliberate policy of this Government to wind back the activities of those institutions and to cripple the future development of things such as the National Museum of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the foreword to the report which was written by the Chairman of the Council, Mr E. G. Whitlam, Mr Whitlam is quite scathing of the Government and, in particular, quite scathing of the former Minister for the Arts, Mr Punch, a person who has since been removed, thankfully, from that particular portfolio due primarily to his manifest incompetence as Minister. He has been transferred to another portfolio where he is currently displaying his manifest incompetence to handle it. In writing the foreword to this report, Mr Whitlam indicated the extent to which it had been a top priority for the gallery to acquire a representative painting from the Cubist period of Pablo Picasso. Mr Whitlam said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are few, if any, national galleries which would in recent times have been deprived by their governments of the opportunity to acquire works of such significance and quality. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Whitlam indicates the extent to which the boorish and philistine behaviour of the then Minister for the Arts has been a significant setback to the collecting program of the Australian National Gallery. He indicates the extent to which direct interference-ministerial interference-in the arts is something about which we hear so much criticism from the Labor Party. It is something that the Government would never be part of and anybody who advocates any sort of arrangement which it does not like is automatically accused of ministerial interference in the arts. Yet Mr Whitlam is clearly nailing what was left of Mr Punch's miserable hide to the wall over this particular incident. </PARA>
<PARA> The gallery is to be congratulated, as is Mr Mollison, the Director of the gallery, on the great success it has had throughout the course of last year. It is a very fine institution. It is a great credit to Australia and to the foresight of previous governments which established it and which allowed it to grow and develop. It is one of the great disgraces of this Government's administrative arrangements and policies that the gallery is put under threat by the way in which Ministers behave and by the way in which this Government is taking the axe to collecting institutions and national galleries throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak briefly on the annual report 1987-88 of the Australian National Gallery. Along with the new Parliament building, the provisional Parliament House, the High Court of Australia and the National Library, the Australian National Gallery has played a significant part in establishing Canberra as the nation's capital. Indeed, it is arguable that a national gallery is a reflection of the national psyche and therefore an essential element of nationhood. Page 9 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It would be a fundamental misconception to regard the Australian National Gallery as primarily a gallery to serve Canberra's residents and visitors. In fact, over 70 per cent of our annual visitors come from interstate. Like the National Library of Australia and the Australian War Memorial, the Gallery has to serve Australians everywhere. No other institution in its area of responsibility is accustomed or equipped to serve all the inhabitants of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The year 1988 has been especially exciting for the Australian National Gallery, with special bicentennial exhibitions in the gallery and around Australia. Many of the gallery's best known Australian works have been on tour as a bicentennial exhibition all over the country. The National Gallery has its own collection of the highest standard of international art. In addition, a very important contribution has been made by visiting major exhibitions, such as the British season of printmakers, the wonderful French photography in the exhibition `Joie de Vivre' and the Phillips Collection, `Old Masters-New Visions'. Such exhibitions give all Australians the chance to see the great masters not in reproduction but in the original. It is important to note that these major exhibitions are not only in the gallery in Canberra but also travel around Australia. I quote from page 44 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the overall fall in tourism to the ACT during the period under review, the Gallery continued to be a focus for tourism to Canberra during the Old Masters-New Visions exhibition, attracting over 160,000 visitors during October and November, 81 per cent of whom were interstate visitors who had come to Canberra primarily to see the exhibition. An attractive exhibition program of wide appeal and regular tourism liaison have contributed to a general increase in the number of patrons. </PARA>
<PARA>Local patrons of the gallery have commented that it should be open at night and such a measure would in part answer those who would regard a casino as the sole answer to Canberra's lack of night life. Night openings, with film shows and other related activities, should occur, in addition to the very successful program of late night openings, at which such well known persons as Paul Keating, David Williamson, Germaine Greer, Jack Thompson and Fred Chaney, among others, have contributed as speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Puplick said, funding for the gallery is under threat and commercial sponsorship has played a major role in maintaining funding. The Government should certainly address that issue. I refer honourable senators to page 14 of the report for a list of these sponsors. Congratulations are due to the National Gallery on a very successful bicentennial year. Attendance figures have risen from 254,000 to nearly 411,000 during the period 1 July to 30 June. The National Gallery has had a high profile at Expo, at Darling Harbour and at regional galleries. The gallery shop is doing a booming trade, and sometimes it seems that patrons are as happy to look at postcards of the great art works as at the works themselves. I commend the report. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I do not wish to speak at length about this matter because I outlined the concerns which led me to raise this matter with the President in a speech on 4 November on the motion for the first reading of some taxation Bills. I indicated then the sections of the Estimates Committee Hansard which gave rise to my concerns. In those sections of Hansard, initially on 25 October, Senator Tate, the Minister responding to questions in that Committee, responding to advice given to him by Mr Perkins, indicated that public money had not been used to bring witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs which is inquiring into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. I will not give the precise quotations; they are available in the Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That matter was followed up the next day in the same Committee by Senator Collins, who asked questions which, in this case, were responded to directly by Mr Perkins. Mr Perkins's responses-which were, again, given by me in the speech I made on 4 November-indicated that the major purpose for which the three witnesses had come to Canberra was sport. Mr Perkins's response was: `The major purpose was sport'. He affirmed that a little later, using the words `consultations on sport'. The point that I made at the time was that on the information which was available to the Opposition, it appeared that those people had spent the great bulk of their time on matters relating to the ATSIC inquiry and we thought that it was certainly not the case that they had come here with the primary purpose of dealing with consultations on sport. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring forward that matter because, of all the inquiries which are available at the moment-I think that we have five government-sponsored inquiries and two parliamentary inquiries, the ATSIC inquiry and the inquiries of the Standing Committee of Privileges, which will flow from my earlier resolution and the motion before us-it is the ATSIC inquiry which actually goes to the substance of what is happening to Aboriginal people in Australia. It is the best and the only opportunity, on my understanding of the situation, for us to address the vital question of what impact government policy is having on both Aboriginal individuals and communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that there is any room for any sense of satisfaction in this matter. Whatever might be said about the good intentions, hopes and aspirations of the Government, the previous Government or the bureaucrats concerned, the reality is that we have some very sobering difficulties to deal with. One of those is very hard to quantify, and I refer to the question of public attitudes. I have said before, and I believe it to be true, that the very broad community sympathy for the Aboriginal people which was evident in the 1967 referendum has been gradually whittled away and in many parts of Australia there is considerable animosity towards the Aboriginal community. I find that distressing but it is, to my mind, quite evident. I do not know whether the Western Australian Democrat senator, Senator Jean Jenkins, who is here and who has, I know, conscientiously applied herself to trying to ascertain the views of her Aboriginal constituents in Western Australia, would agree with me, but I have certainly found evidence of animosity as I have moved around Western Australia and, I think significantly, far more deep and readily voiced animosity against the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Government's programs. That is, in itself, a significant figure. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a matter of a redneck reaction. I have quoted before and I quote again the last conversation which I had some years ago with the late Charles Rowley. Everybody who has any interest in Aboriginal Affairs would acknowledge the extraordinary contribution of Charles Rowley as an academic, researcher, author, head of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and adviser to successive governments, including the Government of which I was part. He was certainly a valued adviser to me, as I know he was to very many people in the Australian Labor Party. The point which he made in a conversation in Canberra was that in redoing the research which had been the basis of his publications in the 1960s-books such as Outcasts in White Australia-he had discovered that in some respects things had deteriorated. When I tried subsequently to examine his research, I found that the most dramatic example of what he was talking about was employment. It appeared from his research that, whereas in the 1960s he had found Aboriginal unemployment in rural areas something under 20 per cent, in the early 1980s he had found Aboriginal unemployment of 50 per cent plus. I give that as an example because, while I am not suggesting that this is a very recent problem, I do suggest that there has been a recent acceleration of the problem in both the attitudinal area and other areas of Aboriginal affairs. I believe it is time that we took a very close look at this matter. I mentioned it at Question Time and I think the Minister, in his response, was critical of my raising it in this context. But I raise it as a particularly dramatic barometer of how bad things are-the fact that, a year after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was established and after new guidelines were drawn up by it, the deaths continued and last July the Commissioner made in Perth what is described in the Australian newspaper as an impassioned speech in which he decried the continual flouting of the guidelines as distressing, both in human terms and for Australia's reputation.</PARA>
<PARA> Reading through the chronology of events since the establishment of the Royal Commission, it is deeply distressing to find that week by week, month by month these deaths continue. I mention them in this context because I believe that, for all the detailed work which will be done by the Royal Commission, in the end it will be found that the deaths are a combination of a number of things which can be readily identified if one spends time with the Aboriginal community; that is, that in too many circumstances Aboriginal people are in a situation in which they despair. I think the combination of despair and the contempt with which they are often regarded and treated has a fatal impact. The deaths in custody are simply one of the nasty indicators-perhaps the nastiest-of a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an issue to which anybody comes in a position of being smug or self- righteous. The difficulties are shared. But I think that the record of the present Government is worse in this area than in any other area of administration because-and this is not the time to labour the point-it has been continually distracted from the job in hand by the chasing of mirages. The Government has chased the mirage of national land rights as a solution; it has chased the mirage of the treaty as a solution; it has chased the mirage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. ATSIC may not be a mirage; perhaps in the end it will go through. My preliminary view is that it is unlikely to advance the situation of Aboriginal people, but my fundamental point is that, in an area which requires, I believe, utter dedication to finding workable arrangements on the ground, within the communities in which Aboriginal people live there has been an excess of reliance on symbolism and a distressing tendency to allow spokesmen for Aboriginal people, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to externalise the problems of Aboriginal people and to pretend that if only one of these wonderful things happens-national land rights, a treaty or ATSIC-in some way things will be better. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC inquiry has to come to grips with whether or not the framework which is being put down is one which will contribute to an orderly situation for Aboriginal people within which they have some chance of living successfully, of advancing themselves and of making genuine choices about their lives. We cannot get genuine choice in a situation of social chaos. In many Aboriginal communities which have been left in the name of self-management without adequate assistance and advice there has been chaos; and tension, drunkenness, fighting, ill-health and a lack of education is what flows from that. This is the difficulty with which we are dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the relevance of this to the motion? It is simply this: this is a situation of enormous difficulty in which honest men and women can differ. I had a discussion with Senator Coulter after lunch, and it would be fair to say, I think, that we had some points of difference on what the solution might be. I accept that in good faith one can have differences. I can have differences with Senator Tate, the Minister at the table, who I am not in any sense doubting is as concerned as any member of the Opposition to see these things put right. But how in the world can we as a parliament make the best decision possible-any decision we make is likely to be imperfect-if there is any blurring of the facts? That is why this reference is important and why I think the Privileges Committee has a particularly and unusually difficult task to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs is trying to examine the ATSIC Bill so that an accurate picture of the Bill and what its impact might be can be presented to this Parliament in order that we do not make more mistakes. That will be a difficult thing to do. But if there is any bending or perversion of the evidence, what is difficult becomes impossible. This matter is being referred to the Privileges Committee because it is something which goes fundamentally to the processes that we have undertaken to try to legislate well in this difficult area. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot prejudge this matter. On behalf of the Opposition, I have put before the Senate those matters which have given rise to our concerns. I say to members of the Privileges Committee that they must be on their mettle when examining these matters. Parliamentary committees are not very good instruments for examining wrongdoing. If there has been wrongdoing, there are better ways of going about conducting an examination, but this happens to be the instrument that we have available to us. I remind the Privileges Committee of the sorts of doubts and difficulties which were expressed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure when it was examining the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1985. Some concerns were expressed in the final report of the Committee about the difficulties of trying to examine allegations of wrongdoing, disputed matters of fact and so on. Members of the Privileges Committee have to examine this matter in a very critical and careful way. I say that because if the Senate has been misled and if the Estimates Committee has been misled, members of the Privileges Committee have to accept that some people are prepared to mislead the Parliament, and they cannot deal with this matter in a casual or easy way. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the reference is a quite difficult one for the Committee. I think it will be very important for the Committee to take evidence from the public servants who performed the subsidiary services that were required to bring the relevant people to Canberra. Yesterday I picked up a piece of gossip that one of the public servants involved is retiring tomorrow. That sort of difficulty can arise. It is going to be vitally important that the Committee examine all of the relevant people who were part of the transaction of bringing the three witnesses to Canberra, primarily, we have been told, for the purpose of consultations on sport. The Committee needs to establish how it came about that they were to be brought to Canberra at that time; where the initiative came from; the actual period of consultation-I am sure there was some, but I suspect it was very brief indeed; how it was planned; when the decision was taken; how it happened that it coincided with the ATSIC hearings; and how it was possible that so much of the time in Canberra could be devoted to the ATSIC hearing. I think the Committee needs also to look at the publicly available evidence that has already been given, which must have been bothering the Government very much, because there was a good deal of Aboriginal disquiet about the ATSIC proposal. Suddenly, three jolly chaps came along and told us that ATSIC is a wonderful proposition. I think that matter needs to be examined, along with the role and the position of those individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer that advice because, as I said, this is a matter of enormous difficulty. I do not envy my Senate colleagues who make up that Committee. I have a lot of sympathy with the views expressed primarily in the dissenting final report about the inadequacy of the parliamentary system to deal with the sorts of allegations which were made to the Committee. I simply commend a very careful consideration of the matters which are the subject of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the long term economic health of this country is probably the most significant thing that will contribute to our long term success or failure-our welfare or otherwise as a nation-in terms of our long term quality as a nation, understanding better how to order our approach to Aboriginal affairs and how better to provide a dignified and independent place within Australian society for Aboriginal Australians is as great a challenge as we face. That is why I, as an individual, express the deepest possible concern at the matters of privilege that we as an Opposition have raised. I think this is such an important issue that we cannot allow any possibility of the processes being distorted or sullied. </PARA>

It is not my intention to tell the Privileges Committee how to conduct its business. I am quite sure that it is competent and able to undertake the inquiry in the fullest and most proper manner to satisfy this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The referral to the Committee of Privileges of the matters raised by Senator Chaney is quite appropriate. The Australian Democrats do not oppose that reference in any way at all. I would like just to say a few words about what Senator Chaney had to say with respect to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It is important that these matters be investigated at this time before the ATSIC legislation is debated by the Senate because if there are any matters of misconduct, mismanagement or abuse within any area of Aboriginal affairs it is important to bring those matters out into the open, excise them and deal with them. We have to ensure that when the ATSIC legislation is debated we are clear in our minds that by sufficiently improving that legislation, if necessary, that new structure can be protected as far as possible from assaults, even the sorts of assaults which might be made through the media or by politically motivated people who are part of the structure itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney seems to have taken the view that Aboriginal people are not capable of the self-administration which is anticipated in the ATSIC legislation. Of course, we are not debating ATSIC now, but I think that is a rather sweeping assertion. I believe there are people in the Aboriginal community who are able to help their fellows in that community within a structure of self-management and self-determination. It is still my view that the ATSIC legislation, given the results which will flow from these several investigations being carried out by various committees, can be improved, can be made better able to serve the main purpose for which it has been designed. At this stage I would simply like to put on record that the Democrats are still supporting the main thrust of this legislation</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard and to table the three explanatory memoranda. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (OPEN GOVERNMENT, PROBITY AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is based on three clear propositions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that, in these modern times, communities expect governments to pay express attention to legislative concerns of the types dealt with in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is that the convenience of citizens and the utility of the provisions are maximised if such legislative concerns are set out in a clear, brief and accessible item of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third is that, in the case of the national capital, the wider national community deserves to know that high standards will apply to a self-governing Australian Capital Territory, and that these have been guaranteed by the measures adopted by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the reasons for bringing these provisions together in a succinct, self-contained Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> But it also has the fortuitous additional advantage of making it easier for this Parliament to focus on the provisions. It makes it easier for us to determine whether they adequately reflect the standards the governance of the national capital requires, and the aspirations the Australian Parliament has for the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill addresses the three broad, and in many ways interrelated, issues of open government, probity in governmental processes, and civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Parliament will be prepared to say that we do indeed regard all three matters as being of the highest importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope we will also say that it is convenient and a matter of common sense to bring them together in a single, self-contained Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> What I put before the Senate is a coherent package of standards to apply to the new ACT government, in both the local and the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament has been so little involved to this point in the specific provisions to be made for ACT self-government that it would be appropriate for us to take a stand on the important matters dealt with in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues and I therefore stand ready to further debate these proposals with maximum expedition if suggestions for their improvement are forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> What I seek from the Senate is endorsement of the principle that these matters are matters of a sort worthy of this Parliament's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe the actual package is one the Senate can and should now endorse. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> Two important matters are at the heart of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the fundamental proposition that there must not be intervention in the affairs or decisions of a legislature by the executive arm of another level of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is the need to recognise that the Australian Capital Territory is at the same time three things in one. It is a specific, discrete, State-type community. It is concurrently the centre of a wider region which relies on it for a number of major services. And it is also the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA> On rare occasions it may happen that the matters at the heart of this Bill are in conflict. The fact that it will be rare does not reduce the need for this Parliament to address the possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, it emphasises the need for the Parliament to set down the guidelines to be followed. It is convenient and proper to do this while the topic as a whole of which it is a part is before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to happen if the ACT legislature does something which is clearly inconsistent with the national interest?</PARA>
<PARA> The short answer is that the Parliament of Australia should, in the national interest, enact legislation overturning the decision of the ACT legislature with respect to the particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is to happen if the Parliament of Australia is not in session at that point, and the course of action decided on by the ACT legislature is to have immediate effect of a sort which it would be impossible to reverse subsequently?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer is that in such a circumstance the Governor-General should have a ``holding'' power-a power to issue an injunction, as it were, which protects the rights of the Parliament-a power which ensures that the rights of this Parliament in such an unusual case are real, not just formal. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the fundamental objective of this Bill. This is the mechanism it proposes, and the reasons for the mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> It rejects absolutely the approach in the Government's Bills of permitting wholesale intervention by the Federal Executive in the ACT legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> It substitutes the important notion that in case of real need the Federal Executive shall have circumscribed and time-limited rights to protect the prerogatives of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (ESTABLISHMENT AND AMENDMENT OF NEW CONSTITUTION) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament is, in effect, in the course of setting down the first constitution of a self-governing Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a heavy and complex responsibility. And we must ensure that we do it as well as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> But however well we do it, it will have a major flaw. It will not have been developed by the people to whom it applies. Nor will it have been developed in conjunction with the people to whom it applies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, therefore, we must proceed to revise and improve the Government's Bills as best we can, on behalf of ACT citizens. Those of us who suspect that the bureaucracy, rather than the Government, has had an unduly large hand in developing the Government's Bills will feel a particularly heavy responsibility in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do our work well, the happy day will arrive shortly when the people of the ACT have a legislature of their own, chosen by fair and appropriate processes. The people of the ACT will then have territorial legislators through whom they can act. </PARA>
<PARA> At that point it would be appropriate for the people of the ACT, and the legislators through whom they act, to have the opportunity to develop a constitution of their own choice for the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Making arrangements for such a right to then exist is a matter we should address at this stage, as part of the larger debate on ACT self-government in which we are all engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill therefore seeks to supplement the wider self-government legislation currently before us. It seeks specifically to spell out processes by which the people of the ACT can ``repatriate'' their constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Guarantees are built in to ensure that the ACT legislature will have full consultations with the ACT community in the development of proposals to put to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If either this Parliament or the Governor-General were to be of the view that these consultations had been insufficient, or were not adequately reflected in the ACT legislature's proposals, the proposals would be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, if either this Parliament or the Governor-General were to consider the national interest to be at risk or insufficiently protected, the ACT legislature's proposals would be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill puts the onus on the ACT to develop proposals acceptable to this Parliament. It also puts the onus on the ACT to utilise processes which are to be scrutinised by, and found acceptable to, this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If the ACT can rise to this challenge, should we deny the ACT the right to its own Constitution?</PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Foreman) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ANL (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the ANL (Conversion into Public Company) Bill is twofold. First to establish the Australian Shipping Commission, which trades as the Australian National Line (ANL), as a public company. Secondly, to remove statutory controls over ANL's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> These are major steps towards implementing the reform package for ANL announced on 25 May 1988 in the statement ``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Enterprises''. </PARA>
<PARA> A major part of the Government's third term agenda is micro-economic reform. Ensuring that Government business enterprises operate as efficiently and effectively as possible is a major element of this reform program. </PARA>
<PARA> ANL provides an important transport link for Australian industry, both internationally and on the coast. Any improvement in its efficiency will therefore immediately be reflected elsewhere in the economy. But this will only occur if ANL is given greater flexibility and the ability to respond rapidly to changes in the market and to take up business opportunities as they present themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, this Government introduced amendments to the Australian Shipping Commission Act that went some way in that direction. Those amendments removed bureaucratic restraints and instilled a more commercial approach into the Line. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of this approach are a matter of public record. ANL has been turned around from being a debt ridden loss maker into a profitable enterprise, regularly paying dividends and income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill completes the commercialisation of ANL started by this Government five years ago. The Line has long been required to operate in highly competitive markets, subject to the same taxes and charges as other operators. Incorporation will now give it the same business structure as most of its competitors. Removal of residual Government controls over its day to day operations will complete the process of giving it the flexibility to compete on truly equal terms with private shipping operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Removal of day-to-day controls will not, however, mean any lessening of accountability. The new Company will be required to:</PARA>
<PARA> provide regularly to the Minister for Transport and Communications strategic corporate plans for consideration and response;</PARA>
<PARA> work towards an overall financial target agreed in advance by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA> ensure appropriate revaluation of its assets at least every five years, the first such revaluation to be settled before ANL's conversion to a company; and</PARA>
<PARA> recommend a dividend annually, after consultation with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> And of course ANL will continue to report on its financial performance through an Annual Report prepared on the same basis as any company. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, ANL is being given the freedom to manage itself on a day-to-day basis without any second guessing from Canberra. But it will remain fully accountable to its shareholders, the Australian taxpayers, through their representative, the Minister for Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions of the Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will establish ANL as a company by providing for the Commission to be registered as a company incorporated in the ACT under the Companies Act 1981 on a day to be proclaimed. It is expected that the commencing day of the company (ie. the transition day) will be 1 July 1989, although it may be earlier than this if the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the other elements of the reform package can be completed earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach embodied in the Bill is basically a refinement of that adopted for the establishment of Australian Airlines as a company. That is, the Bill provides for the continuity of ANL's corporate entity by deeming it to be incorporated under the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The main changes to the earlier approach reflect machinery refinements to ensure that ANL fully complies with public disclosure requirements of registration. These were requested by the Corporate Affairs Commission to avoid administrative problems encountered following Australian Airlines' registration as a company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for there to be no change in ANL's corporate entity. The Commission will change its name (to ANL Ltd) and its form immediately before registration. This will facilitate its registration as an ongoing business enterprise while conforming, as far as possible, to the registration requirements of the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuity of the corporate entity dispenses with the need to transfer assets and liabilities from the Commission to a new body corporate. It ensures that all contracts, agreements and arrangements entered into by or on behalf of the Commission and which are in force immediately before transition will apply to the new Company. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be no ambiguity about this point. ANL will change its form because of this legislation. But ANL Ltd retains the full obligations and responsibilities of the Australian Shipping Commission, and before that, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. Its heritage is clear. ANL remains Australia's national shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the Commission's capital (totalling $196,391,000) to be converted to $1 shares and for all shares in the new Company to be held directly by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that on transition, each staff member of the Commission will become an employee of the Company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the Commission. Entitlements such as long service and recreation leave, and eligibility for sick leave, applying at transition date will be preserved. Those staff who have rights under Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 will retain those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the repeal of the day-to-day controls over ANL contained in the Australian Shipping Commission Act, effective from the time of registering the Commission as a company. This is done in the context of the other elements of the reform package which ensure proper and full accountability. Any minimum levels of control which the Government decides should remain over ANL will be specified in either the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the new Company or in the Guidelines to Directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the legislation we are proposing will make no calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth or, of itself, immediately provide additional revenue to the Commonwealth. The Bill has been drafted to ensure that the transition from body corporate to company status will be ``tax neutral''. However improvements in the performance of ANL Limited that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit the shareholders and all users of the Commission's services. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>OTC (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The OTC (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1988 is part of the Government's reform package for OTC as announced by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans on 25 May this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms to Government Business Enterprises are central to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda to restructure the public sector. In the present difficult and fiercely competitive international trading environment public sector efficiency is especially important. Many public business enterprises-particularly those in the Transport and Communications portfolio-produce not only final goods and services for the consumer, but also provide intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, and thus influence the nation's overall cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA> OTC is established under the Overseas Telecommunications Act. This Act was passed by Parliament in 1946, following the acquisition by the Federal Government of the radiocommunications assets of two companies, Cable and Wireless, and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), which had hitherto operated cable and beam wireless communications systems between Australia and the rest of the world. Since then OTC has operated as a separate body. The 25 May ministerial statement affirmed the Government's decision to retain each of the telecommunications carriers-Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT-as a separate entity. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the increasing competitiveness of international telecommunications, the importance of telecommunications to our economy, the growth in this sector and the fact that OTC serves no explicit social obligations, the Government has decided that OTC will be renamed the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation and it will be incorporated under companies legislation as OTC Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> OTC is an organisation which already operates in a commercial manner. It is subject to all Commonwealth taxes and charges and pays substantial dividends to the Commonwealth. It has an effective monopoly over the central core of its operations, but it faces competition in other areas such as delivery of value-added services and consultancy services. OTC has a sound financial structure with a debt to equity ratio of around 65:35. On conversion to a company, there will be no need to alter OTC's financial structure nor will the ownership change, ie. OTC will continue to be owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In future the Government will be less involved in scrutinising the day-to-day activities of OTC. Instead, it will focus on planning, through corporate plans and financial targets, and accountability for results with strategic aspects monitored on an on-going basis. The emphasis in future will be on the bottom line, on how successfully the goals and targets are met. A myriad of unnecessary Government controls over day-to-day management decision making will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims, through this approach, to establish a clearer distinction between the ownership of the enterprise, the Board and management.</PARA>
<PARA> The OTC (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1988 amends the Overseas Telecommunications Act and deems OTC to be a public company. Like the ANL (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1988 introduced by my colleague the former Minister for Transport and Communications Support, Mr Peter Morris, this approach is consistent with that adopted for Australian Airlines' conversion to company status. As the same legal entity is transferred to company status there is no need to re-write existing contracts and the like. The date for conversion is set by proclamation-at this stage intended to be 1 January 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> OTC Limited will be expected to operate like other companies under the companies code. This means most of the provisions of the Overseas Telecommunications Act will not be needed and can be repealed. Included among these are provisions which deal with staffing matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes provisions to ensure continuity of employment and the maintenance of existing accrued entitlements for each employee on conversion of OTC to a company. </PARA>
<PARA> In future OTC will be responsible for terms and conditions of employment. OTC is currently consulting staff associations on how existing terms and conditions will be dealt with in awards or agreements. The Government expects OTC to make arrangements to transfer terms and conditions and to ensure that no current staff member loses any entitlement or classification on transfer to OTC Limited. The Government will not proclaim the Bill until it is satisfied that the interests of OTC employees are protected and terms and conditions are satisfactorily transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill minimises day-to-day Government controls in line with the enhanced responsibilities and accountability of the Board. There will be appropriate mechanisms to allow the Minister to exercise strategic oversight, through the corporate plan and financial targets. OTC will be free to engage, on its own authority, in such standard business practices as entering into contracts, partnerships, joint ventures, and normal business investment arrangements. In some cases, such as establishing subsidiary companies, the Board will be required to notify the Minister in writing before business activities are expanded. Subject to overall Loan Council scrutiny, OTC will not be required to obtain Ministerial approval to the terms and conditions of individual borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill does not involve any additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or, of itself, additional revenue for the Commonwealth. However, improvements in the performance of OTC that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit the shareholders and all users of OTC's services. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 to implement the Government's reform package for the Australian National Railways Commission (AN). </PARA>
<PARA> The major elements in the package of amendments proposed in the Australian National Railways Commission Amendment Bill are</PARA>
<PARA> to widen AN's powers to expand the scope of its business activities</PARA>
<PARA> to extend the planning and accountability mechanisms which apply to AN, and</PARA>
<PARA> to remove most of the remaining day-to-day controls over AN's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform of its business enterprises is an important element of the Government's third term agenda. The Government recognises that its transport and communications business enterprises must operate as efficiently and effectively as possible if Australia is to succeed in reshaping key sectors of the economy and in improving our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's railway, AN, provides an important element of both the east-west transport service linking our major manufacturing and export centres of Sydney and Melbourne to Adelaide and Perth, and of the north-south corridor through Alice Springs to Darwin. On the mainland, AN operates non-metropolitan freight and passenger services in South Australia, extending from South Australia to Kalgoorlie in the west, to Alice Springs in the north and Broken Hill in the east. In Tasmania, AN operates freight services. </PARA>
<PARA> AN's mainland business competes for freight traffic with the road operations of the major freight forwarders, independent `truckies' and with coastal shipping. It also competes with coach and bus passenger services. Interstate transport accounts for more than 75 per cent of AN's commercial freight business. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to AN's legislation in 1983 designed to promote AN's role as a business undertaking have already done much to put AN on a more commercial footing. Over the past five years, AN has greatly improved its performance-its call on the taxpayer has been reduced in real terms by 66 per cent, and it is expected to break-even on its mainland freight operations this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to AN's Tasmanian operations the Government announced in May 1988 that it would continue to support Tasrail for the next five years. AN expects to break-even on Tasrail operations by 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA> The reform package is designed to consolidate the achievements to date and provide AN with an environment in which it can achieve the highest possible level of operational and financial efficiency while continuing its move to profitability. It will continue the process of commercialisation initiated in 1983 allowing AN greater freedom to manage and greater flexibility to compete in the market place. The Government considers that AN should have a further opportunity to consolidate its position and improve its performance before more changes are made. </PARA>
<PARA> Greater freedom to manage means that AN should be freed from most of the remaining day-to-day controls over its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the Bill amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> removes the requirement for AN to obtain ministerial approval to enter into contracts</PARA>
<PARA> removes the requirement to obtain the Treasurer's approval for the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, investments or banking arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> empowers AN to recommend an auditor of its choice. </PARA>
<PARA> AN will remain subject to Loan Council processes for its borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Removal of day-to-day controls will not, however, mean any lessening of accountability. AN will continue to be required to:</PARA>
<PARA> provide regularly to the Minister strategic corporate plans for consideration and response; and</PARA>
<PARA> work towards an overall financial target agreed in advance by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this Bill will require AN to advise the Minister of any matter which significantly affects the outlook as established in the corporate plan as soon as possible after such matters become known. </PARA>
<PARA> Any additional costs arising from Government ownership for items such as superannuation and auditing requirements will be taken into account in determining AN's financial target. </PARA>
<PARA> AN will continue to report on its financial performance through an Annual Report. </PARA>
<PARA> AN must be able to consider offering the same broad range of services as its competitors and have the ability to respond rapidly to changes in the market and to consider business opportunities as they arise. Accordingly this Bill widens the scope of associated or supplementary business activities into which AN might consider expanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Commissioners will now be subject to dismissal for on-going underperformance (in addition to current grounds such as misbehaviour, mental illness etc), in line with the emphasis on accountability for results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director will be appointed by the Minister after receiving a recommendation from the Commission. Terms and conditions of employment for the Managing Director will be a matter for the Commission. The Commission will consult with the Remuneration Tribunal about the remuneration package for the Managing Director in line with the amendment of the Remuneration Tribunals Act introduced in the Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Bill (Part V). </PARA>
<PARA> The transition to the new arrangements is expected to be completed by July next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the legislation we are proposing will make no calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. Improvements in the performance of AN that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit taxpayers by further reducing AN's call on the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Satellite Communications Amendment Bill is part of the Government's reform package for AUSSAT as announced by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, on May 25 this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms of Government Business Enterprises are very important for the Government's overall micro-economic agenda. Public sector efficiency is especially important in the current economic and international trading situation because many public business enterprises produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy and have an influence on Australia's overall cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA> AUSSAT was established in 1981 for the purpose of establishing, owning and operating a national satellite system. Commercial operations commenced in 1985 with the launch of AUSSAT 1 on 27 August 1985. From its beginning AUSSAT was established on a sound commercial basis. It is incorporated under the Companies Act and has a Board of Directors, a commercial financial structure and relatively few unnecessary Government controls over its day-to-day managerial decision making. Since July 1984, the Commonwealth has held 75 per cent, and Telecom 25 per cent, of the company's shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Since AUSSAT is a company, most of the steps needed to implement the May 25 reform package can be achieved by amendment to the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association. Consequently this Bill contains only a relatively small number of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> One amendment modifies the definition of neighbouring regions to allow AUSSAT more scope for selling its services. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom owns 25 per cent of shares in AUSSAT and is entitled to nominate up to 25 per cent of the Directors. The Bill makes two minor technical amendments to the provisions relating to the AUSSAT Board. The first ensures that a Government Director appointed to both the Telecom and the AUSSAT Boards does not affect Telecom's entitlement to nominate AUSSAT Directors. The second provides that any Telecom employee appointed to the AUSSAT Board falls within the 25 per cent limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions have also been included to exempt AUSSAT from the Public Works Committee and Lands Acquisition Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> In future the Government is to be less involved in scrutinising the day-to-day activities of AUSSAT. Instead, the Government will focus on planning, through corporate plans and financial targets, and accountability for results with strategic aspects monitored on an on-going basis. The emphasis will be on the bottom line, on how successfully the goals and targets are met. </PARA>
<PARA> By this approach, the Government aims to establish a clearer distinction between the ownership of the enterprise, the Board and management. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill does not involve any additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or, of itself, additional revenue for the Commonwealth. However, improvements in the performance of AUSSAT that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit the shareholders and all users of AUSSAT's services. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

I understand the matter is before the Federal Court today and tomorrow on the application of representatives of the pathology industry seeking a judicial determination of the validity of the determination made by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett).

As a result, if that course of action takes place any hiatus in the administration of this scheme will be taken care of. If, however, the Court finds that the determination is a valid determination, then the Senate will be able to proceed with the consideration of the motion for disallowance I have moved on behalf of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had gone on to explain that this, in part, results from a failure by this Government to vary taxation rates with inflation, which is resulting in taxpayers, particularly middle income taxpayers and lower income taxpayers, paying massive additional taxation that has been estimated at about $8 billion. At the time of the adjournment I was referring to an article appearing in the Melbourne Herald by the well respected financial journalist Terry McCrann. I had quoted the first paragraph before the adjournment of the debate. In this article Mr McCrann advised:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This stark reality makes a mockery of Mr Keating's attacks on `tax cheats' for there has been no bigger cheat in the past few years than the Government itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, the Government was somewhat outraged by that article and unfortunately the retort of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was to abuse Mr McCrann rather than to debate the matter on the issues, and it was necessary, therefore, for such respected tax lawyers as Dr Ian Spry, QC, to come to the rescue of Mr McCrann, and he did so in an article also in the Melbourne Herald a day or two after Mr McCrann's series. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Herald is to be commended for publicising the enormous tax increases recently imposed on almost all taxpayers by the Hawke-Keating Government by relying on bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA>A little further, he continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Bracket creep has been the main cause of the reduced after-tax purchasing power of wages and salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating, who has done so much to make Australia's tax system harsh and unworkable, is to be criticised for refusing to accept the obvious correctness of Terry McCrann's recent articles on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not tolerable that an Australian Treasurer should, as Mr Keating has done, deny what is clearly true. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words, as I said, are from Dr Spry, the editor of the Australian Tax Review; not from an Opposition politician, but from an authority of that note. Of course, it is that type of sentiment, that obvious fact of the enormous cost to Australian taxpayers of bracket creep, that has led the Opposition to move the second part of its amendment in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the Government has mainly relied on bracket creep through the various personal income tax brackets, and also on the introduction of new incentive-sapping taxes such as the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax to fund its Budget surplus;</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to continue in setting the scene for the contents of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) by also drawing to the attention of the Parliament the fact that the result of this rapidly increasing taxation toll is that Australian families on average weekly earnings, with a dependent spouse and two children, would need a minimum tax cut in July 1989 of $56 a week to restore real household income to its 1983 level. So the effect of this rapidly increasing taxation has been to reduce significantly living standards of middle and lower income earners in this country. I also wanted to remind the Government of the distortions that are present within its taxation system and which it should be addressing before it moves to legislation of this type. For example, I remind the Government that a family with one income earner, a dependent spouse and two dependent children on average weekly earnings pays significantly more tax than the same family with two equal income earners and no dependants bringing home the average weekly earnings between them. This is something that the Opposition has addressed on a number of occasions, but which has not been answered by this Government, resulting in a tax prejudice on single income families. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to remind the Senate that these massive increases in income tax have also got to be put in the context of massively increasing indirect taxation under this Government. Indirect taxation in the form of sales taxes, excise duty and customs duties has increased significantly. In fact, in the six years of the Hawke Government there has been a 147 per cent rise in sales tax-three times the rate of inflation. Of course, it is probably unnecessary for me to tell the Senate that that hits hardest on lower income earners, particularly families with young children who are consumers of foods such as orange juice, ice cream, flavoured milks and snack foods, on which this Government has, for the first time, imposed a consumption tax, despite Mr Hawke's repeated promises not to impose such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> When one compares the cost to lower income earners of this taxation system with the costs applying in comparable countries such as the United States, Japan, Canada, France and West Germany, in all cases one finds that the effect is that at lower income levels people are paying proportionately more taxation. Add these faults within the system to the methodology of the Government in enacting its taxation laws, the methodology of taxation changes by announcement and by press release, and we again see a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. It has always been accepted that in some cases it is necessary to make an announcement of change and that the change in taxation laws should take effect from the date of the announcement. However, what was never envisaged was the incredible delays that would take place between such an announcement and legislative enactment. We see it demonstrated aptly in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) that is before us, which includes some changes that were announced some 3 1/2 years ago-an intolerable situation, I would have thought, in the eyes of anyone who is looking for a reasonable system of taxation law. Not surprisingly, the Government's failures in this area have been condemned not only by the Opposition but by Senate committees, most recently by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and by the Law Council of Australia. I remind the Senate of a recent release of the Law Council of Australia of 19 October. In referring to the criticism of the Government in this area by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council, like the Committee, has repeatedly urged the Government-and particularly the Treasurer-to stop using media releases to usurp the legislative role of the Parliament in a way that makes a mockery of the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a particularly strong indictment, I would have thought, from such a highly respected body as the Law Council of Australia, but of course it continues to be ignored by the Treasurer and by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the policy of this Government in relation to taxation law and the effect of bracket creep has arisen not by accident; it is part of a design and part of the Government's election strategy. This we all learnt from the Treasurer's advice to the Labor Caucus before announcing the May statement of this year, which was recorded for the benefit of us all in the following morning's Australian Financial Review. This was when he briefed his Caucus colleagues on the tax cut strategy which he put to the Caucus in these terms, or so we understand it from the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, here it is folks. All of you people who thought you were going to lose your seats at the next election, this will save you. This will get us back into Government. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the strategy involve? It involved real wage reductions in 1987-88 and 1988-89 while reaping higher taxation revenue from bracket creep, and that is proving effective, as I have demonstrated, to the extent of some $8 billion a year; using the additional taxation to build up a substantial budget surplus in 1988-89 and 1989-90; and using this revenue fed surplus to provide large personal tax cuts in July 1989-just in time for the next election. So, it is a deliberate strategy and it has been at considerable cost to the Australian taxpayer-I repeat, to taxpayers on middle income levels and taxpayers in lower income areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The complexity of the taxation laws and their confusion is particularly demonstrated by these Bills. The complexity in the laws that they are seeking to amend has been demonstrated so well by those who have criticised the capital gains taxation package. I will use just one example although, of course, it has been criticised by many. Mr Matt Walsh, a partner in the legal firm of Mallesons Stephen Jaques, when he was delivering the Harold-Irving endowed lecture earlier in the year to the national conference of the Taxation Institute of Australia, said that the capital gains tax has brought confusion to the business world because of a lack of clarity and ambiguities in the drafting of legislation. He said that the consequences of the legislation imposed considerable hardship on taxpayers and that the confusion arising out of the legislation was in stark contrast to a promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) after the ill-fated Australian Taxation Summit of 1985. That confusion and those ambiguities have led us to move the third part of our amendment in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), and that is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>(3) such new taxes represent increased complexity and uncertainty in the administration of the taxation system and so decrease efficiency and equity;</PARA>
<PARA>I move quickly, because time is against me, to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). As I said in passing a moment ago, I want to make specific mention of the fact that amendments included in that Bill, particularly those to clauses 12, 13, 24 and 54, implement, subject to some minor variations, proposals that were announced on 4 February 1985, that is, over 3 1/2 years ago. I stress the attitude on this side of the chamber, that such methods of making law by announcement, are not only unfair to taxpayers but also unsatisfactory for the professionals who have to work in the tax area. They should not have to wait over three years for specific definitions of general principles that are contained in press releases. I would have thought it was about time that the Government took some note of continuing criticisms in this area and did something about them. </PARA>
<PARA> In an environment of unsatisfactory law the Government goes one step further and requires, it seems, the Commissioner of Taxation to enforce the law according to subjective assessments of fairness. I have to say to those on this side of the chamber that that is a most worrying precedent. We remind the Government that no-one under our system should be above the law, whether it is the Tax Commissioner, the Treasurer or anyone else. This growing practice has received widespread criticism. It is unnecessary for me to do more than just mention a few criticisms. An editorial in the Australian Tax Review of March 1987 said:</PARA>
<PARA> `What has now developed is in the nature of a witch hunt . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>More recently, the President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Dennis Byrne, referred to Mr Boucher in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>an over zealous official pursuing a crusade collecting revenue according to his own standards of fairness instead of according to law. </PARA>
<PARA>It is easy to blame Mr Boucher, but the real responsibility for the task that is set for government officials rests with the Government and the Treasurer. It has been clear from questions that have been asked in the Senate in the last few weeks that what the Government thinks is important, more important than acting according to the law in enforcing taxation, is that the law be enforced according to subjective judgments of what is fair. I regard that as one of the most worrying precedents to develop in the seven years that I have been in this place. We give the Taxation Commissioner wide and unique powers on the basis that he, acting under the authority of the Government, will not abuse those powers but will always act according to the law rather than according to what he or the Treasurer might think is the spirit of the law. I suggest it is about time that state of affairs was put right. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office it has introduced some 295 taxation measures. I would have thought it was about time that the Government paused and tried to put the taxation laws of this country into some sort of order rather than simply piled amendment upon amendment. When I look across the chamber at my friend Senator Messner sitting with two massive volumes of the Income Tax Assessment Act and compare them with its size not very long ago, I see a demonstration of, as I said last night, the literally thousands of extra pages of law that the Government has produced in this area. Of course, it is not just the problems of interpretation that have to be endured; with them go the time and effort of government instrumentalities, lawyers, accountants, business owners and the staff of businesses. The management and administrative costs in relation to taxation law in this country are now enormous. If one speaks to people in business, one is made aware of the fact that there are now few days left in the working calendar in which some sort of taxation action does not have to be taken, such as lodging returns for group tax, prescribed payments, withholding tax, sales tax, provisional tax, company tax and the fringe benefits tax, or to lodge tax stamp sheets, group certificates, reconciliations and returns. In fact it has been estimated by some that up to a quarter of the working year is taken up with the lodging of returns or meeting the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office. I again say to the Government that it is time to pause and to look at the cost of this ever-growing burden of taxation and to start putting the house in order. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the last 24 hours we have again had a demonstration that these matters of particularly serious note are not simply matters of political moment that have been raised by the Opposition. I remind the Government that within the last 24 hours it has been told by its own advisory body, the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC), that it is heading down the wrong track. We, on this side, have been arguing that the taxation system discriminates against families on average weekly earnings and middle income earners generally by a hidden indirect tax that hits consumers hardest and through the effect of bracket creep. Now the Government has been told the same thing by its own advisory body. It has reminded the Government that many low income earners face the highest marginal tax rates in Australia's post-war history. The EPAC report shows that the marginal tax rate for a single taxpayer on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings has increased from 30 per cent in 1983-84 to 40 per cent in 1987-88, a period of just five years. Clearly that is evidence, even for this Government, of the effects of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular EPAC has found that the current marginal and average rates of tax are appreciably higher for most taxpayers in the 1960s and 1970s; that increases in average marginal tax rates have generally been greater for taxpayers with dependants than for single taxpayers; and that the political, social and economic ramifications of high marginal tax rates are so persuasive as to suggest that careful attention needs to be paid to marginal tax rates. I would have thought that was an understatement. EPAC also states that a family on average weekly earnings was facing an effective 35.33 per cent marginal tax rate when the Hawke Government came to power and it is now hit with a 40 per cent rate. That means that instead of keeping 65c in every extra dollar earned, it is now keeping only 60c. Those who have benefited under this Labor Government have been the highest income earners-an astonishing fact of life. That is why the Opposition has moved its amendment. I have mentioned three parts of the Opposition's amendment in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. The fourth one is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has lost sight of the needed direction for Australia's future;</PARA>
<PARA>The fifth is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government should accept that the highest priority needs to be given to reducing the enormous tax burden, so that the standard of living of Australians can be improved while at the same time addressing the nation's external economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition also has moved an amendment to the second reading motion on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988. I now seek leave to move two amendments to that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reiterate the very strong argument put forward by my colleague on my behalf concerning the amendment moved by me at an earlier stage. The whole point of the issue is simply that this Government has abused the practice of legislation by press release. My colleague Senator Hill drew attention to statements by various authorities, such as the Law Council of Australia and others, which have drawn attention to this most undesirable practice, which has reached the highest form of art, the Government having tried to introduce tax legislation 3 1/2 years after the date of a press release back in February of 1985. It is intolerable that such a thing should occur, and it is wrong and unjust in the interests of taxpayers of this country. For that reason the Opposition felt obliged to move the amendment that it has moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The import of Senator Hill's main amendment to the second reading amendment is quite clear: In the event of the Government announcing by press release that it intends to legislate certain taxation matters and failing within three months to produce that legislation, the Senate will automatically take the date of the introduction of the Bill as the date of its commencement. There will be no backdating of the legislation to the date of the press release unless the Senate so resolves. That is always within the power of the Senate. That is the import of the main amendment moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the amendment to be perfectly reasonable in light of the great abuse of this system by the Government. Senator Hill referred to the enormous amount of legislation that has been introduced since the Government came to power-some 259 pieces of legislation. As he mentioned during his remarks, we now have an Income Tax Assessment Act which is utterly unintelligible even to the Commissioner of Taxation. From time to time he is forced to put out draft rulings before he actually comes to a conclusion as to what the ruling is. That shows how unintelligible the language of the Act is now becoming. Consequently, this is a very well reasoned and reasonable issue to push at this time. It is time that the Government had this matter drawn to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), which is before the Senate at the moment, is just another example of what has happened in the past. We all know that the Government failed to bring forward its legislation on the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax at the time the legislation was announced back in September 1985. We had to wait nearly nine months before that legislation appeared. That is totally unreasonable. As I say, this latest example of a delay of some 3 1/2 years is absolutely intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the kind of situation that has arisen in recent times and to which the Government needs to pay specific attention is its announcement on 25 May in the mini-Budget that the Government is to introduce the taxation of superannuation funds' income. That legislation, as announced at the time, will now be subject to the rule set out in our amendment, if this measure is passed by the Senate. It means that we will apply the Bill providing for the taxation of the income of superannuation funds from the date of its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Estimates Committee debates we heard from the Commissioner of Taxation that that Bill would be introduced some time between now and the end of the sittings before Christmas. We have certainly had no signs of it, and unless it is incorporated in some legislation that does not give away its name, we do not see it on the list of measures to be introduced before the end of this period of sittings. We are therefore looking to 1989 before we can debate this measure and have an opportunity of going through it. As we all know, the Government's new proposal for the taxing of superannuation funds is likely to be extraordinarily complex because of the way in which the Government has gone about its job. It would seem, therefore, that the earliest time the Parliament will be able to debate that legislation will be almost 12 months from the date on which it was announced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an intolerable situation, given the enormous complexity of the sort of law that will need to be applied in the case of superannuation funds. Therefore, the Opposition feels thoroughly justified in moving the amendment that Senator Hill has now moved to the second reading amendment that I moved previously. It will have the effect, as I say, of bringing the date of application of future taxation laws handled by the method of legislation by press release to the date on which the Bill was actually introduced into Parliament. I understand that Senator Hill's amendments will have the support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA> In the press comments on the EPAC report, and subsequently in the short time that I have had to look at a copy of the report overnight, I found great heart, and indeed even some hope, for those groups of Australian citizens about whom I have been speaking in the context of taxation and other debates since I came to this place over two years ago. Other groups in the community, such as the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and so on have long been speaking about those groups in relation to the effects of poverty traps. Many of these poverty traps are generated specifically by the relationships which are explored by EPAC between taxation and income support mechanisms and, of course, the whole question of incentives, which is the issue addressed by the paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of equivalent marginal tax rates, which is a term used throughout this paper, is a major issue and one with which we need to come to grips, particularly if we subscribe-as certainly the Australian Democrats do-to a social justice strategy. It must be taken account of. The terminology has more generally been termed `effective marginal tax rates' but I am happy to use EPAC's term-if I can remember it-of `equivalent marginal tax rates'. Unless we do so we cannot achieve social justice and the taxation system as it applies will remain an impediment. The equivalent marginal tax rate is defined by EPAC in its report. Just to make sure that people are aware of what we are talking about, that tax rate relates to the reduction of Government benefits as private incomes rise within the tax system. For a great many people-and, indeed, as EPAC points out, for an increasing number of people-this is a major problem. As I said, I took some hope from the EPAC paper and certainly some hope from the Australian Financial Review headline which said something which I and others have been saying for many years. The headline in the Financial Review yesterday was, `Welfare recipients pay more tax than top-rate executives'. This is a problem which has been compounded over the past year or so with what tax cuts we have had being more effective for the high income earners. This is a point which Senator Hill alluded to. </PARA>
<PARA> Some moves have been taken on the issue of poverty traps, but I would have to say that they have been puny attempts so far. We must remember the delay of six months in the first of those puny attempts to remove poverty traps. In the 1986 Budget the Government decided that the move from $30 to $40 of permissable income level before the cut-off began of the Government benefit would be delayed until July 1987. The other headlines in yesterday's newspapers on the EPAC report also brought to the public's view those concerns which we have held over a long time. From the Australian we saw, `Welfare payment locks in poverty', and from the Melbourne Age, `More people are living in poverty: report'. This article went on to detail some aspects of the report. The Australian Financial Review pointed out that the study finds poverty traps so severe for some pensioners, beneficiaries and low income families that there is little incentive to work beyond a few hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we note that here we have the Government's economic advisory committee pointing out that there are built-in disincentives through the combination of the income support system and the tax system for pensioners, beneficiaries and low income families. We hear a lot about this from the Opposition, and quite properly so. There is no disagreement that we have problems in this system and in the tax system generally for people who are not welfare recipients. There are problems of disincentives and equity in the tax system and in many respects they are increasing. Of course, that is a challenge for the Government with the next round of tax cuts. But we hear too little about the built-in disincentives for those people on pensions or benefits. Unfortunately, the response to the disincentives, which is very often to stay on those benefits and not to seek work as the EPAC report points out quite clearly, in many places can actually be at a financial cost to those people. Too often the reaction to that response to stay on benefits and welfare rolls is to hit those people, to blame those people, to call them dole bludgers and to label sole parents as ripping off the system. That is the unfortunate trend which I hope this EPAC report will be able to stem. </PARA>
<PARA> I will address that trend with regard to sole parent families-the group specifically mentioned and about which some individual cases were given in this report. This is not just a matter which came up yesterday. I would like to refer to a letter from Susan Barclay of the Council for the Single Mother and Her Child which was published in the Age on 1 September this year. It reflects the sort of comment that has been made in the welfare sector and by the Democrats for a long time. Susan pointed put:</PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly little incentive to work when a sole parent receives a net gain of only $15 a week from 20 hours work because of the combined effect of taxation, the costs of working, loss of concessions, and income tests on child care, pension and, in some cases, public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Poverty traps, together with the generally lower wages received by female sole parents-</PARA>
<PARA>we are talking of a vast majority of females in this situation-</PARA>
<PARA>means that work can only be rewarding personally but not financially. </PARA>
<PARA>I venture to suggest that Susan Barclay is actually being a little charitable because as we all know many of those low-paid jobs which women get if they are fortunate are all too often less than personally rewarding. Susan went on to point out that while the child support scheme is welcomed the fact that it continues not to have a maintenance guarantee for all children of sole parent families means that it in itself is deficient and will remain so in terms of the Government's social justice strategy and its child poverty strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> A comprehensive report has been made by the Brotherhood of St Laurence pointing out the specific problems of sole parents. That report was put together before the implementation of the child support system but many of the problems are still not addressed because of that deficiency within the child support system. A report in the Financial Review yesterday also referred to an increased emphasis on targeting and means testing to improve benefits resulting in severe and intractable poverty traps. Of course, it is a real dilemma for the Government-or for any government-following this EPAC report that targeted welfare benefits may be detrimental to the very people for whom they are designed in all good conscience to benefit. Sole parents are among those people who are increasingly targeted and in perhaps a different way. I noticed in this year's annual report of the Department of Social Security in the section which is talking about the increased effectiveness of the new mobile review teams that the rate of overpayments that had been identified amounted to $2.3m whereas in the annual report of the previous year the overpayments identified amounted to only half a million dollars. Clearly, that group has been targeted and nobody would stand here and say that people should be able to rip off the welfare system, but I urge all senators to look at the annual report of the Department of Social Security and to listen to all the debates on this topic. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask senators to look at what has been finally revealed by the high status EPAC report-things which have already been said by many other organisations; I have mentioned the Brotherhood of St Laurence, ACOSS, welfare rights units and centres in Melbourne and Sydney-and in other groups, such as sole parent groups, widows groups and so on. I ask senators to look at those and wonder about the $2.3m overpayments and about the targeting. We should wonder about the poverty traps and the built-in disincentives that are in the system. We should consider how much of that was genuinely ripping off the system or was simply the result of the built-in disincentives in the system and the disadvantages, both economic and personal, that face sole parents-largely women-in attempting to get themselves off the welfare roll and into secure employment. That is the only way for people to get out of poverty in the long term and is certainly the desirable course for the vast majority of people in the community. The question is as to how much of the targeting and suspicion in the community is justifiable. Even if it is legally justifiable-although I have often in this place questioned the workings of field officers and the way things are operating under the more draconian powers of the Department of Social Security-the question must be asked whether it is morally justifiable in the context of the sorts of problems outlined in the EPAC report. </PARA>
<PARA> I address specifically the question raised in the Opposition's amendment in relation to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), particularly the second point which complains about the Government mainly relying on bracket creep and which talks of the introduction of new incentive-sapping taxes. I reiterate the point that in the community there are people other than employed taxpayers whose incentive is being sapped by the taxation system in its relation to their income support systems. In regard to bracket creep I wonder whether the vehemence with which Opposition members are supporting that part of their amendment is any indication of proposed Opposition policy in this area. I note that the only way we shall avoid bracket creep in a progressive taxation system-a system which the Democrats support-is through indexation of marginal tax rates. One gives credit to the Fraser Government for introducing such indexation in 1976 and maintaining it through to 1977-78, but then one has to come up a little short and note that in 1978-79 indexation was reduced, shelved in 1979-80, reduced to half indexation in 1980-81, and abolished from 1 July 1982. One wonders whether, despite the Opposition vehemence on this issue in this chamber today, things would be any different under an alternative government, which I imagine the Opposition in this chamber sees itself to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously any government-the runs are on the board-will be reluctant to introduce taxation indexation purely and simply for the reason that if it does it will not get the credit for the automatic tax cuts that apply under that sort of system. If there is one thing that we know about the members of governments or alternative governments it is that they want to get the credit for everything they possibly can, whether it is gold medals at Olympic games or tax cuts. In this case they have it within their power to ensure that they do get the credit. Therefore, they do not give us indexation and when not in government they complain about the fact that their opposite numbers have not taken that step either. Therefore, it has about it a hollow ring. One would be very interested to see whether the Fraser campaign in the 1975 election promising tax indexation is likely to be renewed in the next Federal election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment goes on to complain about the complexity and uncertainty of new taxes. I assume that the Opposition is talking about the just taxes introduced by this Government, to its credit, supported by the Democrats-the fringe benefits and capital gains taxes. The amendment also talks about the decrease in efficiency and equity in the tax system. I exhort Opposition members to go to the EPAC report and to recognise the areas of particular inequity, which I am pointing out on behalf of the welfare recipients, in terms of disincentive in the relationships they have with the taxation system, which is impeding their ability to get out of that system. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition is talking about equity in the tax system, one has heard a great deal in recent days about a gold tax, a tax which the Opposition is opposing vehemently. I am told that it is designed to bring in $300m in a full year, which is roughly the same amount as the tax file number is said to bring in. The Opposition will support that proposal willy-nilly along with the Government at the risk of invading people's privacy. Nevertheless, that is the position. If we are talking about equity, as indeed the Opposition is in its amendment, it seems odd to the Australian Democrats that we could not obtain the Opposition's support a day or so ago to amend a sales tax Bill to prevent increased sales tax on soy milk, which would have cost the Government only a few hundred thousand dollars. In earlier years one has in mind the Democrats' amendments to stop sales tax on flavoured milk and increases in the sales tax on juice, and so on. Therefore, if we are talking about equity in the tax system, I do not know that the Opposition can expect too much support on that general basis from this corner of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> As I try on this occasion to represent the position of people who are outside the full employment sector in our economy but who are affected by the tax system, it is a matter of concern that the challenge before the Government of tax cuts for next year does not look very promising. I hope that the Government will take a great deal of account of EPAC's comments in this context. There is enough evidence around to show that there is a lot of pressure on the issue of tax cuts. There is, of course, the Treasurer. I noted an article by Laura Tingle in the Australian early in October this year which raised some issues which are of concern to the economic rationalists who too often prevail on both sides of the chamber. She pointed out, for instance, that cuts to lower income earners flow through to higher income groups as well, and that the majority of taxpayers-and this is a political problem-are now in a higher tax bracket. Therefore, it is difficult politically to give breaks to a minority of people. Laura Tingle said in her article:</PARA>
<PARA>These problems suggest that next year's tax cuts will be much more of a middle-class affair than the Government's rhetoric suggests. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps we should say `Senator Walsh's rhetoric suggests'. He is standing up, so far at any rate, to pressure on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to interpose another area of pressure which comes from Senator Stone, the epitome of economic rationalism, perhaps neck and neck with the Treasurer. I happened to be at a conference of the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration a week or so ago in Melbourne at which Senator Stone and Senator Walsh were attempting to put a different economic view, which in itself was a challenge, and I could not resist being in the audience. On that occasion Senator Stone-I have with me the notes I took in the audience-said that he considered Senator Walsh to be one of the more rational economic minds in the Government, except in his attitude to the tax cuts, on which so far I congratulate Senator Walsh. There is pressure that the tax cuts that are to come will not necessarily go to low income earners. They need to go to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need most of all, at least for the groups of people I am talking about and also for single income, low income families, is a change to the tax-free threshold. That is a very expensive exercise for the Government. I acknowledge that it has gone some of the way in terms of the pension rebate, but all that means is that a pensioner can earn $10 a week above the permissible free area given by the rebate and that pensioner is into the tax system. It is a major problem and it is one which the EPAC report has brought out. It provides a great challenge to government, especially a government which says that it is committed to social justice and which publishes on the issue of social justice. Rhetoric is fine but we need action. </PARA>
<PARA> Laura Tingle pointed out in yesterday's Australian that the welfare lobby had had something of a significant win in the EPAC paper because it endorses those arguments that `social security payments have positive economic implications, such as reduced crime rate and preventing the loss of skills or educational standards'. I would add there `health and other issues'. That is an important message for a government which says that it is committed to social justice. However, looking at performance, how can we have social justice when major initiatives in housing have to do with increasing benefits for those who are in employment and in a position to purchase and do not add assistance to those people who are not in employment and desperately need public housing? For instance, last year $12m went back into Consolidated Revenue from the attendant care program because the guidelines are so strict. One has to question social justice in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there are two strands to any strategy which is directed towards achieving social justice. One is to address the current inadequacies, some of which the EPAC report talked about and others of which I have mentioned. Those current inadequacies must be addressed in the system delivering assistance to people in need. That is called targeting. It is a comment on our current priorities that most of the Government's actions so far-I mention also the Victorian social justice strategy, which is somewhat in advance of the Federal Government's strategy-are devoted to those remedial targeting-type measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The other strand which is necessary and which will have to be carried out if we are to get social justice is the strategic or developmental element which should be designed to produce structural changes and increase the capacity of people to break the cycle of disadvantage; that is, changing the nature of the system itself. That is the challenge that EPAC puts up to us in the context of taxation policy in the broader policies of government in general; that is, changing the system itself. In that context I commend to the Government a change to the system which the Australian Democrats are seriously examining-that is, the development of a more reasonable approach to the sort of guaranteed minimum income approach which was put as far back as the poverty inquiry in the 1970s. It is a national support income policy which has been put to us by Allan McDonald, currently of Queensland. This national income support system is not paid on top of existing incomes but replaces part of those incomes and is available to all people in the community. It was first developed in the context of the rapidly increasing unemployment of a decade or so ago. It is very much a system which does away with incentive-sapping overlaps in the current system, which the EPAC paper points to, and is perhaps the only system by which we can achieve social justice in reality. The author of the abridged paper which I have before me, and which I am very happy to give any honourable senator a copy of, asks:</PARA>
<PARA>Why must we continue to maintain our separate compartments for industrial relations and welfare?</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the nature of this exercise as part of the wage structure system. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>why can't we consider preventing poverty rather than relieving poverty?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important question. I was interested to hear Julian Disney of ACOSS comment on the EPAC report on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio last night. He put the view that the way out of the problems that EPAC draws to our attention, problems which are inextricably linked to the taxation system, was perhaps to increase the number of people receiving some kind of social welfare support, other forms of assistance-not just pensions and benefits, but general social goods. It is the sort of concept that is embodied in the social wage. He advocated other forms of assistance, such as child care, being more broadly available perhaps so that people do not see themselves as separate from the social support systems which are inherent in our society. I thought that he used a very good example when he said that people somehow see payment for the family allowance, which we have very strictly income tested, as different from payments, for instance, that the Government puts into roads or other infrastructure. Why should we? We all benefit from the one and the question is whether we all, as members of the community, should not benefit from the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that those are the broad issues raised in the EPAC report in the context of the current debate about retirement incomes policy. They are very important and they are issues which this Government, the Opposition and all people making relevant decisions in this community need to bear in mind. Those are the major points that we can take out of the conjunction of the events of the EPAC report coming out and our dealing with a range of taxation Bills, as we are in this debate. Hopefully, we can come out with some rational approach which will avoid the disincentives, the poverty traps, for that group of people who may not be in full time paid employment but who may very well be trying earnestly to get there and finding all of these barriers in their way and, even worse, being condemned for the fact that they have to face disincentives which we have built into the system and which it is almost impossible for them to surmount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of amendments, including some to be moved by the Government, to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and a couple of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). I will not go into the detail of those amendments at this stage; I will reserve that for the committee stage. In the second reading debate proper there have been numerous assertions, some of them so generalised that they were almost meaningless, some exaggerated, untrue or irrelevant. I will not waste a lot of time dealing with those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there were a couple of quite specific comments made in the second reading debate on which I want to set the record straight. Senator Panizza appears to be under the impression that the option to choose either the prime cost method of depreciation or the diminishing value method is an option which must be exercised at the time a piece of plant or equipment is purchased. That option can be exercised at the end of the year. In fact, it increases the options available to the taxpayer because the taxpayer may now make such a choice at the end of each year for plant purchased within that year, whereas previously a choice had to be made for one of the two methods on all existing and future assets or on all assets first depreciable in the year of election and in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point relates to comments made by a couple of people at least about the uplift factor in the provisional tax. By the way, for the benefit of Senator Panizza, the first point related to plant depreciation. I do not know whether he heard what I said. Of course, the uplift factor is related to the very large increase which is anticipated in farm incomes for this year. The objective of the uplift factor for provisional tax is always for the provisional tax which is applied to be the best approximation of the actual income which the taxpayer will receive. But all taxpayers, of course, retain the option to vary that provisional tax assessment, which is based on the previous year's income adjusted by the uplift factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the second reading motions have been moved in respect of both the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). I will deal first with the amendment in relation to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) because that is the way we will deal with them at the committee stage. That amendment, even with the most recently proposed amendment to it, is still a Clayton's amendment in so far as the last paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) resolves that, where the Government has announced by press release its intention to introduce a bill to amend taxation law, and that Bill has not been introduced into Parliament within 3 calendar months of the date of that announcement, the Senate shall, subject to any further resolution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read any further but, as I interpret it, it is still a Clayton's amendment in so far as it does not-and, I expect, could not-bind the Senate in the way in which it deals with any future legislation. However, I do want to make some comments about it. It requires an extraordinary amount of chutzpah for the Opposition to put up an amendment which says that, because right off the top of my head I can recall the 5/3 depreciation measure, which is the subject of one of these Bills, being announced in July of 1982 by the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Labor Government ultimately enacting it in May of 1983-a full 10 months afterwards. Indeed, the Fraser Government, though announcing the changes to 5/3 depreciation in July, over five whole months-over most of July, August, September, October, November and part of December-did not even bother to introduce legislation, much less have it passed. So it requires an extraordinary amount of chutzpah for the members of the then Government which did that, and which had even longer time lags on other occasions which I cannot specifically cite, to have the effrontery to propose something like this. I will be saying something about the more specific amendment regarding the date on, I think, Taxation Laws Amendments Bill (No. 4). That might surprise the Opposition, too. So, of course, the Government will not accept that second reading amendment, a Clayton's amendment though it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make just a brief comment on the proposed amendment in relation to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). The first paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) this is the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make this comment about that: the figures in this year's Budget Papers show that total taxation as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is higher than in any other year recorded in that table-marginally higher than it was in 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Government. However, there was no Medicare levy in 1982-83, and if allowance is made for that in fact the total taxation as a proportion of GDP in 1982-83 was marginally higher than it is predicted to be this year. But, much more importantly, the Fraser Government did not have a taxation policy so much as a borrowing policy, particularly in its final years. In 1982-83, it left a deficit of almost 2 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product. It is easy to get tax levels down if we pile up debts instead-and that is exactly what the Fraser Government, under John Howard's treasurership, did. By contrast, in this financial year, we are budgeting for a surplus of around 1.7 per cent of GDP. That is a total difference of more than 4 per cent of GDP in the effective, or properly measured, level of taxation once adjustment is made for whether a government is substituting a debt policy for a tax policy or running a tax policy in conjunction with a redemption of debt policy, as this Government is doing. When those adjustments are made, in fact the Fraser Government in its last year had an effective level of taxation, adjusted for debt and for Medicare, more than four percentage points of gross domestic product higher than is budgeted for this year. So, again, I can say only that it takes an extraordinary amount of chutzpah for the Opposition to move an amendment to the second reading motion such as that. Of course, we will oppose that as well when the time comes. Otherwise, I do not propose to delay the passage of the Bill any further. </PARA>

<PARA>the amount that, apart from this subsection, would be applicable under subsection (2) in respect of the benefit shall be reduced by the non-deductible entertainment percentage.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment was proposed by, I think, some private accountants and taken up by the Opposition. The Government agrees that the original clause left open the possibility of double taxation. For example, if a business gave $100,000 interest free to an employee, or to a partner for that matter, which was then invested by the employee in an income generating activity, as the Bill stands at present the employee would be required to pay tax on the income generated by the investment. As the clause originally stood, the employee could also have been required to pay tax on the imputed value of the interest free loan. That would have been a case of double taxation, which was not the intention. However, I should point out that if in such a case the employee uses the $100,000 loan to buy a house in which the employee lives, then the imputed interest will be assessed as taxable income. </PARA>

<PARA>I draw attention to one matter that has not been brought out in earlier stages of the debate. It relates to the non-cash benefits that may be provided as interest on loans provided at some kind of discount to the interest rate. I ask the Minister whether, in a situation where money is lent at a concessional rate of interest by an employer to an employee and where there is a common interest in the earning of assessable income between the employer and the employee, that would fall outside the concession provided by the amendment that has just been agreed to. This matter was the subject of discussion with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at an earlier stage. I understand that the Government has given assurances that such a circumstance would not entail the taxation of interest benefits. I want to get it on the record that that is the Government's position. </PARA>

That amendment related to the non-cash business benefits provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and resulted from constructive consultation between the Government and the Opposition. I thank the Opposition for that. The amendments the Government has agreed to accept will ensure that non-cash business benefits are not taxable in three situations. Firstly, the amendments will exclude from taxation a non-cash business benefit to the extent that the benefit is used by the recipient in circumstances where, if the recipient had incurred its cost as an expenditure, the cost would have been otherwise deductable to the recipient.</PARA></TALK.START>

This will ensure that a taxpayer, in carrying on a business, will not be assessable on a benefit the cost of which would otherwise be deductable if the taxpayer had incurred it. The provision of an interest free loan is an example where, if the recipient uses the moneys for a business purpose, the amendment will exclude this benefit from assessment in the recipient's hands. The next paragraph is not relevant to that first amendment. This is getting terribly complicated but, if I understood Senator Messner correctly, he asked what would happen if, say, $110,000 was given by a company to an employee or a partner which was then invested with 50 per cent of the return accruing to the employee-cum-partner and the company.

<PARA> 1. Page 13, clause 13, proposed subsection 21a (3), proposed definition of `non-cash business benefit', lines 31 and 32, leave out ``4 February 1985'', insert ``31 August 1988''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment has the effect of altering the date of commencement of the Bill from 4 February 1985 to the date of the introduction of the Bill into the Parliament, 31 August 1988. As we discussed during the second reading stage of the debate, the origin of this piece of legislation was an announcement by the Government in a press release put out by the Treasurer on 4 February 1985. Since that time we have seen people going on in what basically is blissful ignorance of the law. Non-cash benefits of the kind that have been set down, or considered to have been set down in that press release some 3 1/2 years ago, have been accruing taxation as they have been received in the hands of taxpayers. The press release back in those times was not at all clear in its terms as to exactly what kinds of benefits were to be covered by it. In fact, the purpose of the amendments which we have just been discussing in the committee stage, and which have now been passed, were in respect of what might be loosely termed the `Avon ladies situation', where benefits of relatively little value which were being covered by the terms of this legislation were apparently going to be caught. However, there was no indication in the press statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) back in February 1985 that such benefits would be caught. Indeed, the press statement was almost misleading in that sense in that it seemed to indicate that the kinds of benefits that would be caught by the legislation were benefits which were the subject of the Federal Court case where the Commissioner of Taxation took issue with Cooke and Sherden. I understand the facts of that case were in relation to the provision of overseas travel for winners of trips overseas; that is, those kinds of benefits which were not convertible to cash. That being so, that was apparently the loophole which the Government was seeking to catch by the press statement that it made back in February 1985. However, the situation that we have with the so-called prizes for Tupperware ladies, Avon ladies and so on involves benefits--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tupper-persons, perhaps. The situation is that by the terms of this Bill, as distinct from that press statement, one would have believed that those persons would not have been caught. The reason I assert that is that small prizes such as saucepans, coffee mugs, or whatever they might be, that are being provided for people in those circumstances are the kinds of benefits which could be convertible to cash and consequently were not mentioned in the press statement as being the kinds of benefits that would otherwise be caught; yet when the legislation was brought down it indicated that such benefits could be caught. Therefore, that has been the purpose of the very useful negotiations we have had with the Treasurer's office to seek the amendments which have now been supported on all sides of the Senate. We welcome that kind of cooperation from the Treasurer. It is not something that we have seen much of over the last several years. It might have been very helpful, for instance, in relation to the passage of the capital gains tax through this Senate in 1985. The reason we are seeking for the date of the introduction of the legislation to be the operative date for the commencement of the new Act is simply that we believe that people were not on proper notice from 4 February 1985 in the terms of the press statement issued by the Treasurer then and, consequently, could not have known what the Government had in mind as to what exactly it was intending to catch by that legislation. In those terms it seems blatantly retrospective and consequently we oppose it on those grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point has to be made that, back in the days of the tax schemes, it was a practice adopted by the former Government, the Fraser Government, and carried on to some extent by this Government, that a type of scheme, a type of series of transactions that had been identified by the Tax Office, was proscribed in a press statement with notice that any further schemes of that kind being undertaken would be subject to legislative proscription. That was indeed the practice that the former Government adopted. Clearly, in the case of avoidance, and where there are specific schemes being used in the community, there is every justification for that kind of approach because, quite clearly, those people who have indulged in those sorts of schemes should be put on notice that the Government intends to take action against them. Surely that is a totally different situation from that in which an announcement is made by the Government that it intends to legislate in particular cases according to its own whim. This statement of 4 February 1985 is in that category rather than being in the category of relating to those kinds of tax schemes that we saw in force around Australia in the period up to about 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason, therefore, for our moving this amendment in order to make the application of the legislation come into force from 31 August 1988, that being the date of the introduction of the legislation. It seems to us to be perfectly consistent with past practice of both governments and of the Tax Office in former times. It is also perfectly consistent with the Liberal and National parties' approach to retrospective legislation now that we have identified that that legislation is retrospective. </PARA>

<PARA> I simply wanted to indicate that we have a very sound basis for moving this amendment at this point. I would not be surprised if the Government used all kinds of specious arguments which might lead us down other tracks in defence of its position on this matter, but the principle is crystal clear: the Government has legislated retrospectively and that is the point of principle upon which we stand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little puzzled as to why Senator Messner should have offered us that last sentence since I thought I made it perfectly clear in the debate on the second reading on this matter that not only were we just as concerned as members of the Liberal Party were over the Government's increasing habit of legislating by press release, but that I had, in fact, last month written to both the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pointing out that we were not going to tolerate this sort of thing any longer, particularly when we have a situation, such as applies here, where something like 3 1/2 years passes between the time that the press release is put out announcing the proposed legislation and the time that it is introduced. I will read from a copy of a letter that I wrote to the Prime Minister. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am writing to you and the Treasurer on the vexed subject of legislation by press release. The Australian Democrats have raised their concern about this on numerous occasions in the past and we remain convinced that the practice is not acceptable.

<PARA>I interpolate here that that is assuming they know about it and frequently people selling Avon or Tupperware products and so on are not aware, but those that are have no choice but to adjust their transactions immediately-</PARA>
<PARA>despite the fact that the merits of the legislation have not been considered by the Parliament. Furthermore, the parliamentary debate itself is affected by the press release declaring the immediate effect of the proposed law. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly had a problem there-again I interrupt myself to point this out-with some legislation affecting the operation of insurance companies last year. It was announced by press release months and months before the Parliament actually got to look at it. I went on to point out to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Law Council of Australia has devised guidelines on legislation by press release. The Australian Democrats endorse those guidelines with the exception that legislation must be available to the public within 3 months after the date of the announcement (as opposed to the one month time frame proposed by the L.C.A.). </PARA>
<PARA>I attached a copy of those guidelines in the letter to both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrat Senators have agreed that, unless these sensible and moderate guidelines are adhered to we will amend legislation of this kind by inserting a new starting date. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that many of the problems that have occurred in the past could be avoided if your Government adopted these guidelines. In the interests of the Australian citizens and businesses adversely affected by the practice of legislation by press release, we hope that you will accept the guidelines and avoid the necessity of the Australian Democrats addressing the problem in the way I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines for legislation by press release that were attached to those letters to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were, as I said, those of the Law Council of Australia, with the exception that its point (g) was changed by us to say that:</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation must be available to the public within three months after the date of the announcement either by its introduction into Parliament or if Parliament is not sitting, by public release of the Bill by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is so that people actually know what they are getting themselves into. The Government can say `We told you that in the press release'. Well, press releases are two or three pages long at most, and some of this legislation is extremely complex. Until we actually sit down and look at clauses in Bills, we are not in a position to know precisely how the legislation is going to affect us, our business, our employees and so on, or whether it will have any unintended consequences. Heaven alone knows, we get unintended consequences in legislation all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes the situation worse on this occasion is that first of all it was, as I said, some three and a half years between the press release being issued and the legislation being issued. But more importantly, some changes were made in the legislation so that the proposals that were announced three and a half years ago were not accurately reflected when the Bill was finally produced. When we have a three and a half year time gap and then the legislation differs from the announcement, there is a very real problem. In fact, the Government admitted this by including transitional provisions in clause 54. Then we find, according to submissions from Arthur Young, that the transitional provisions also differ from the announcement. It argues in a letter to us that the proposed legislation will, in its opinion, apply to benefits received after 4 February 1985, even though the benefits may have been provided under contracts entered into on or before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's announcement did not make it clear that the legislation would apply to benefits provided under contracts entered into on or before 4 February 1985. In addition, the February 1985 press release says `The amendments which are to apply to benefits given or granted after today . . .'. In the legislation, clause 13 states `non-cash business benefit' means property or services provided after 4 February 1985', while the transitional provisions in clause 54 state `The section applies to non-cash business benefits provided on or before 31 August 1988'. One is left very much up in the air wondering whether the legislation applies to benefits provided under contracts entered into on or before 4 February 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this highlights the real problem we have of legislating by press release, a problem which is exacerbated by the fact that there is such a huge time frame between the press release and the legislation that is finally produced. That is why I think that last guideline from the Law Council of Australia is such an important one, that there be a maximum period between the announcement and the production of the legislation, either in the Parliament or by way of draft to the general public. We will certainly be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Messner. The only reason we are supporting him instead of his supporting us is that, as usual, the Opposition gets precedence when it comes to amendments in this place. We had already signalled our intention to make these moves. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one other point. When the Government issues press releases which announce legislative changes, whilst it is certainly not going to be able to dot all the `i's and cross all the `t's-to do that it really has to produce a draft of the legislation, and if it could do that it would not have to worry about the press release-it should at least make those announcements in the press releases as clear, precise and understandable as possible, so that the people who are to be affected know they are to be affected, know how they are to be affected and know from when they are to be affected. We should not get to the situation where we have announcements that do not match legislation, and transitional clauses that do not match the announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> We will certainly be supporting the amendment to clause 13 to change the starting date of this legislation on non-cash benefits from 4 February 1985 to 31 August 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Non-cash benefits which were convertible to cash have always been taxable in the hands of the recipients, and still are, and until the Cooke and Sherden case of 1980 so were non-convertible benefits of an income nature. But the court in 1980 ruled that non-convertible benefits could not be subject to tax. This legislation seeks to ensure that in future they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present Opposition, the then Government, had at least a couple of years between 1980 and 1982 in which to do something about the Cooke and Sherden decision, but it did not do anything. Because of that anomaly, interpretation, writing of the law in the courts, or whatever one would like to call it, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made the statement in 1985 that benefits which were not convertible to cash would be taxed as they had been prior to 1980, in the same way that benefits which are convertible to cash continued to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that it is a long time between 1985 and the introduction of legislation in 1988 and the Government is vulnerable to criticism on that ground. However, that does not justify the action proposed by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats or the amendment moved. I understand-indeed, Senator Messner has made this fairly clear-that the Opposition was activated by approaches on behalf of Tupperware and Avon agents and people who had been receiving benefits. However, it appears that the benefits they received were in fact of a convertible nature rather than a non-convertible nature and, therefore, probably would not be affected by the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). However, since the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation has been drawn to the convertible benefits received by these agents, they are effectively inviting an audit and assessment of the convertible benefits they have received going right back to 1936, if they have been receiving them for that length of time. Whether that will actually be done is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation to decide. This could well be an exercise that will backfire rather heavily on the people who originally made the representations because, irrespective of what happens to this legislation, even if it is thrown out altogether, if benefits of the type which have been described have been received, they are, according to the advice I have, likely to be taxable as convertible benefits. Drawing attention to the fact that they have been received is an invitation for an audit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a note from the Australian Taxation Office that I ought to read out because it is very important. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>It should also be highlighted that there is, among a few, a serious misconception that non-cash benefits of a kind that can be convertible into a value have only become assessable as a result of these amendments. On the contrary, these non-cash but convertible items have always been assessable since 1936 under ordinary concepts of income. Examples of items taxable since 1936 are motor cars, television sets, microwave ovens, jewellery received by taxpayers in lieu of cash income. The new law merely provides a valuation rule for all non-cash business benefits and extends the net to include non-convertible non-cash business benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>That is relevant to the point I was just making. The advice received by the Government from the Taxation Office is that the revenue resulting from and the effect of the amendment Senator Messner has just moved will be negligible because the announcement back in 1985 put an end to the practice which was rapidly developing of paying benefits of a non-convertible kind and thereby avoiding tax. Our advice is that the 1985 announcement virtually stopped that practice stone dead, so the revenue losses will be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government will not accept the amendment, because if it is carried it will mean that announcements that taxation rorts will be knocked on the head will no longer be a viable threat to the people who have been doing the rorting. Indeed, it will be tantamount to an invitation to lay one's ears back and get right into it as far as one can and as quickly as one can. If the three-month provision which the Australian Democrats now propose to move, as I understand it, to the next piece of legislation as a Clayton's amendment-still with the idea that the Senate will impose a three-month rule-actually receives some credence, that will exacerbate the problem. I have already conceded that the Government is vulnerable to some valid criticism for this piece of legislation, but I have been sufficiently involved in taxation policy over the last few years to realise that certain pieces of legislation and, in particular, legislation that is designed to stop tax avoidance frequently require some very complex drafting. Even if the parliamentary draftsman, the Taxation Office and the tax policy branch of the Treasury had nothing else to do, which is never the case, it would take a considerable length of time to draft such measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Opposition: What it is doing here is potentially very dangerous if it goes ahead with it. It is even more dangerous if there is an expression of opinion-and it would be no more than that-of the Senate that three months is the longest period that will be allowed between an announcement to close off a tax rort and the introduction of legislation into the Parliament. Let me give an example. Normally the Parliament adjourns in the first week of December and resumes in the third or fourth week in February. That leaves a space of nearly 2 1/2 months, which is normal. If the Government becomes aware in the beginning of November, say, of a serious tax rort and makes an announcement that it is going to close it off, unless it can get the legislation into Parliament within a month-which, if it is at all complicated, is a completely unreasonable expectation-then the three months rule will not be complied with unless a special sitting of Parliament is called in January. I suppose that is an option that is available; it is not one that would be welcomed by the people in the Parliament at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that, according to the advice I have received, the revenue consequences of this amendment are negligible, but if the Opposition proceeds with the amendment it will be setting a precedent which could well undermine the effective closing of taxation rorts and loopholes in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the Committee's attention another matter which has been the subject of some discussion with the Government in recent times. It was referred to during the course of the debate at the second reading stage. This is bringing to light the situation where a partnership changes its constitution for one reason or another. The underlying property is the subject of the depreciation laws as they have applied up until now and since 1982, but as I understand the provision of the law, after the application of this change, the new less liberal system of depreciation rates will apply. As such, it would cause the partnership, as reconstituted, to lose the benefit of the previous rates. This would apply notwithstanding that a change to a partnership, be it a professional partnership, a joint venture or perhaps a property development, might only be of a very minor kind. It may be, for instance, with a professional partnership, as I understand it, a change of, say, 10 per cent of the total ownership of the underlying asset. That is something that obviously is unfair where the benefits of the previous depreciation rates structure have been lost, notwithstanding a very minor change to the overall constitution of a partnership.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were discussing clause 37, which deals with the new system of depreciation as announced in the Treasurer's statement of 25 May. The effect of this is noted in an article in the Australian Financial Review today which summarises the story quite well. The matter I raise affects partnerships where there is a reorganisation of the constitution of a partnership. As a result the previously more generous depreciation taxation regime applicable to the underlying property of the partnership before 25 May may be lost because of that minor change. Following 25 May a vastly less generous system of depreciation deductions was made available to business. This may well affect the situation where there has been a relatively minor change in the ownership or construction or constitution of a partnership, whereas the underlying property itself had not been changed at all-that underlying property being the subject of tax deductions for depreciation. There could be changes in the partnership of, say, 10 per cent where a partner comes in and takes over the partnership of another. The percentage may be less, or it may be more. Concern has been expressed in the business community, as pointed out in the article to which I have referred, that significant tax benefits may be lost arising from what is a very technical change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Partners under the tax law, as I remember it, where there is a continuing ownership of a property by the partnership, are deemed to have sold the property to the new partnership at what might be determined as an agreed value for the property. The question is what value has been agreed, and therefore there is some question as to what the Australian Taxation Office might consider as being a reasonable value in these circumstances. It means that in each individual case of partnership reconstitution since 25 May this year there will have to be individual negotiations with the Taxation Office to determine how the new depreciation regime might apply to each individual circumstance. This is said by the article in the Australian Financial Review to be because of the lack of clarity in the law. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) whether he is prepared to give his views to the Committee about how the system might operate within the Taxation Office as a result of this matter being brought to his attention. In other words, is he prepared to give an undertaking that the benefits of the previously owned property under the old taxation rates before 25 May would continue to apply after a change to the constitution of a partnership where that partnership change is relatively minor?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether the change was minor or not, as I understand the position, the answer to the question is no-that the new tax depreciation rates would apply. I have a more comprehensive answer from the Australian Taxation Office on this question. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the question regarding 5/3 depreciation, I have been advised that the Commissioner does not have a discretion to allow a taxpayer to `rollover' 5/3 depreciation in circumstances where there is a disposal-that is, after 25 May 1988-of a part interest in an asset that is currently being written off under the 5/3 regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Special provisions of the income tax law apply whenever there is a disposal of a depreciable asset. If there is a difference between the sale price of the asset and its depreciated value, the resultant gain or loss is treated as assessable income or as an allowable deduction, as the case may be, of the vendor. This treatment ensures that a taxpayer receives a deduction for any decrease in the value of an asset in excess of that already allowed as a deduction, and conversely that the revenue recoups tax lost where a deduction has been allowed for depreciation in excess of the actual decrease in its value. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax law also has specific provisions designed to apply the same rules where there is a disposal only of a part of an interest in a depreciable asset. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the case to which Senator Messner referred. </PARA>
<PARA>In these cases, the whole asset is treated as having been sold from the old owner or owners to the new owner or owners. This ensures that any taxpayer who disposes of an interest in a depreciable asset includes in their taxable income the gain or loss arising from their portion of any difference between the sale price of the asset and its depreciated value, at the time of change. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not discretion in the Commissioner not to apply these rules in the case of a partial disposal. Further, it would be inconsistent to apply the existing rules on a partial basis only, that is to treat the disposal as a full disposal, without also applying the current rates. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be noted-and this is very important-that when the 5/3 regime was first introduced in 1983, disposals of part interest in a partially depreciated asset operated to apply 5/3 to that asset. In other words, at the time of the 5/3 change for the great majority, if not all, depreciable assets the rate of write-off would be accelerated following the introduction of the 5/3 regime. For most, though probably not all, under the provisions of this legislation the rate of write-off would decelerate. There were windfall gains in 1983 when the 5/3 regime was introduced, and there will be windfall losers when the new regime is introduced. I should qualify the term `windfall gainers and losers' because it is the action of individuals in making their decision to change the structure of the partnership which will affect whether they are gainers or losers, and not the legislation per se. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effects of proposed new section 45, which seeks to insert new subdivision H, were announced in the May mini-Budget and preclude the immediate up-front deduction of amounts that have come into existence through the trading in of contracting plant, transport equipment and so on where an amount received for the traded in plant is well in excess of the residual value of that plant as described in a lease agreement. Past practice in the transport industry and other industries for the refinancing of new equipment in these circumstances has been to use lease arrangements. As I understand it, the surplus over the residual balance has been treated as a one-off payment to the financing institution and, as such, has represented a part of the total rental payment on the lease of the new equipment. That payment has, therefore, become a tax deduction where the plant is used for the earning of assessable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I raise with the Minister was raised at the second reading stage and has been raised with the Treasurer by certain accountants and interests associated with the transport industry. Is a deduction denied for such an up-front payment, which represents a surplus earned on the trading in of a property or item of plant and which, logically, has been gained over a much longer period and therefore should be spread over the whole of the period of the lease? I think I know what the answer to that question is. However, the point is whether the Minister can confirm that a tax deduction will be denied in those circumstances, and whether that is consistent with the Government's approach in this legislation. In other words, did it intend such financing arrangements for the re-leasing of new equipment and the offsetting of surpluses gained in that way by the trading in of old equipment to be caught by this part of the Bill?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Committee's attention to the obvious hardship that that will create in some parts of industry. It will certainly have an impact in the trucking industry, where this is a very common practice in dealing with the surplus gained in the situation I have outlined. It will obviously have an impact on future freight rates charged to customers for carting wheat, wool and other primary produce, and will lead to higher charges in future. The other question is whether it will have an impact on an industry which, generally, has been regarded as being in a state of financial crisis for quite a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only in the transport industry that such an effect could be felt. It will also impact on the earth-moving industries and thereby have a major impact on building costs at a time of rapidly rising prices for housing which the Government has, I understand, been seeking to combat. Yet it is driving further costs onto builders and those engaged in that industry and that must be reflected in higher inflation rates. That is notwithstanding a 4 per cent increase in the housing index announced only about a fortnight ago with the most recent consumer price index figures. I wonder what the Government is really on about in these circumstances since it will have major impacts on not only individual operators but also the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just some kind of tax gimmick or way of avoiding tax. It is a result of the inflationary circumstances in which people with this kind of equipment find themselves when they trade into newer equipment. Let me give an example. A trucking rig that might have been purchased five years ago for $100,000 might cost $200,000 today. The residual value of a plant item purchased that long ago as described in the lease at the time might have been $25,000. If one were to trade in that item of plant today, because of inflation and the increased value of the new item of plant one might receive, say, $75,000 for the value of that old plant, which is well in excess of the residual value of the lease. That means that that surplus of $50,000 is really just an inflationary adjustment; it is not really reflective of a real gain. For that reason it has been dealt with in the way described and has been the subject of comment in the last few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government ought to consider amending the legislation so as to take account of the situation, because quite clearly it will have an inflationary impact right where we do not want it. We do not want increases in building and housing costs. We do not want increases in trucking rates that will impact on farmers in drought areas. Of course, this is a factor in my State of South Australia, half of which is in drought. That is the sort of problem we will see in the next few months as a result of this kind of policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to a slight misunderstanding among an assortment of senators earlier today, it was not made possible for the chamber to amend the second reading motion for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) to express the Senate's concern about the Government's use of legislation by press release. I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) supports a more certain and predictable taxation system for all taxpayers;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the government is creating widespread uncertainty and confusion in the minds of taxpayers through its blatant use of `legislation by press release';</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses the view that, in the interim period before legislation is introduced, press announcements should be as clear and precise as possible; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) resolves that, where the Government has announced, by press release, its intention to introduce a Bill to amend taxation law, and that Bill has not been introduced into the Parliament or made available by way of publication of a draft Bill, within 6 calendar months of the date of that announcement, the Senate shall, subject to any further resolution, amend the Bill to provide that the commencement date of the Bill shall be a date that is no earlier than either the date of introduction of the Bill into the Parliament, or the date of publication of the draft Bill''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment has been amended slightly from the one that was circulated earlier, at the request of the Opposition. The request took place as we were crossing the floor to have the original division. Part (d) of the amendment has been amended. During that earlier division, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) indicated that three months was likely to be an inappropriate length of time and that, in the case of excessively complicated pieces of legislation-which, I hasten to point out, the one under debate earlier today is not-three calendar months was not sufficient for the Government to present a Bill to the Parliament. So, at the suggestion of Senator Messner, we have now given the Government six calendar months, six times the length of time recommended by the Law Council of Australia and twice as long as the period we had earlier thought reasonable. Also, we have given the Government the opportunity, in the event of the Parliament not being in session at the time, actually to produce draft legislation for discussion. That, of course, is something that has happened in the past. Governments of all persuasions regularly release draft legislation for debate in the community, particularly if it is likely to be about contentious issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The dates relevant to the commencement of the Bill will relate either to the date of the introduction to Parliament of the Bill or to the date of publication of the draft Bill. Furthermore, written into the last paragraph of the amendment is a proviso that all of this is subject to any further resolution. So I cannot see how we could have done any better than we have in at least expressing the opinion of the Senate that members of Parliament and the public generally are getting increasingly disturbed and concerned at the way in which governments operate legislation by press release, expecting people to know what is in the press release and somehow to divine what will be in the subsequent legislation and to arrange their matters of business, income tax payments and so on accordingly. I remind the Senate that this expression of opinion is being done in a way which is not binding, since it is only an attachment to the second reading motion. I think this is not an unreasonable second reading attachment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event of a government other than a Labor government ever being in power, I am quite sure that Senator Walsh, if he is shadowing the Finance or Treasury portfolio, will be more than pleased not to be confronted with a piece of legislation that has been 3 1/2 years in gestation following the original seed planting exercise of the press release. I hope this amendment will get the support it deserves from both sides of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA> 2. Page 24, clause 37, after proposed subparagraph 160zwa (13) (b)(ii), insert the following new subparagraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(iia) if land (in this subparagraph called `the excepted land') that formed part (whether a minor part or a significant part) of the original area is not included in the new area but land (in this subparagraph called `the new land') that did not form part of the original area is included in the new area-the circumstances that gave rise to the exclusion of the excepted land from, and the inclusion of the new land in, the new area and, in particular, the circumstance where the taxpayer sought, but was unable to secure, the inclusion of the excepted land and agreed to the inclusion of the new land only as a substitute for the excepted land; and'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have circulated three amendments relating to two concerns that I raised during the second reading debate that took place what seems like quite a long time ago. One concern related to marital breakdowns between 1985 and the subsequent period in 1988, and the other related to the section of the Bill relating to roll-over relief from capital gains tax for land converted from a crown lease to freehold. The first two amendments deal with the latter-that is, crown leases. The first amendment is, I guess, a consequential amendment or a preceding amendment to the major amendment to clause 37. </PARA>
<PARA> The main case that has been drawn to our attention is that of E. L. Yencken and Co. Pty Ltd, which currently leases some land from the Crown in South Melbourne. The Victorian Government informed this company on 6 October 1987 that, to achieve the Government's planning, redevelopment and financial objectives, it would not be offered the whole site it presently occupies under a crown lease but part of it and an adjoining piece of land in substitution. That, I gather, is where the problem arises. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendments to the roll-over provisions relating to capital gains tax contained in the legislation before us, the company will be able to retain only about 56 per cent of its capital gains tax free asset; that is, the ownership of the new land will be treated as a post-19 September 1985 purchase which is subject to capital gains tax when it is sold in the future. The relevant proposed new subsection in this Bill provides that, where the original area differs from the new area, the Commissioner of Taxation may treat the new asset as relating in whole or in part to the old asset. The Commissioner is directed to have regard to all relevant circumstances in reaching such a decision, including those specifically set out in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we run into a problem with the explanatory memorandum, which suggests that proposed new subsection 13 is to be read restrictively so that it will apply only where there are marginal differences between the original and new areas of the land. In Yencken's case, and because of a decision made by the State Government, the new area accounts for 44 per cent of the total land area. This was not a decision that was made by Yencken. It was not requested by that company; it was a decision which was made for the convenience of the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With the assistance of Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, the Democrats have had drafted an amendment which seeks to include in the legislation another relevant circumstance that the Commissioner in exercising his or her discretion must have regard to concerning old and new assets-in particular, the circumstance in which a taxpayer has sought but has been unable to secure the old asset unchanged. The amendment will protect not only Yencken but also taxpayers generally in this class of situation where an unequal taxation treatment would otherwise result because the old and new assets are not `substantially the same' as presently defined in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that these sorts of-I presume-unintended consequences are not allowed to go through. This company-and it is probably not the only one-has been leasing land for some time. It would have quite happily taken over, more or less, the site it presently occupies but it simply did not suit the Crown for it to take over that land. So an alternative offer was made by the Crown-that is, by the State Government-to Yencken. Under those circumstances, it seems unfortunate that the Commissioner is to have discretion only to take into account marginal variations, when it is, as I said, not the company but the Crown that is making the necessary changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go on at length about this matter. I think it is a perfectly straightforward case. The site had one lot of boundaries when it was leased. The transfer suggested by the Victorian State Government has another set of boundaries. There is a significant change in the boundaries although part of the property is the original leased land. If I and everybody else are reading the legislation right, the Taxation Commissioner is given no discretion because marginality certainly cannot be extended, under anybody's definition, to mean 44 per cent. I ask the Government, as well as the Opposition, to look kindly on these amendments because this matter is something that is out of the hands of the group that originally leased the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to indicate that we in the Liberal and National parties will be supporting these amendments. The point at issue concerns a person who, ever so briefly, loses control over property in the conversion of a crown lease to freehold, a situation which the Yencken case exemplifies, and has conditions forced upon him which were not contemplated at the time the crown lease was originally granted. The effects of the law as it is set down presently would be unfair to any person in that situation. That is why we support this amendment. We believe that the Government would be otherwise taking advantage of what is a temporary condition whereby a crown lessee has lost control of his property in the legal argle-bargle of receiving his freehold. He has no bargaining position with the crown lessor and as a result is not able to negotiate from a position of strength in terms of what shape the property he originally contracted for might end up. There is an element of compulsion in this which in the case of Yencken and no doubt others is exercised by a State government. In that event, given those circumstances of compulsion we believe that it is totally unfair for the Government not to grant relief from capital gains tax in a situation where people could literally be caught with their pants down.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill already allows roll-overs, in cases where a piece of leasehold land is converted to freehold and where land is offered in lieu of land which has been compulsorily acquired and land offered in lieu of land that is under threat of acquisition; that is, when there are negotiations between a State government, usually, and the previous landholder. In addition, there is a discretion available to the Commissioner to allow roll-overs for exchanges of land-non-compulsory-if the differences in the land are marginal. As I understand it, Senator Haines is correct that that is the intention of it-that the differences would have to be slight before the Commissioner would exercise that discretion. The Government believes that that has gone far enough. It does not accept the amendment, for the reason I have given; that is, we believe we have gone far enough, and also because it could be used as a lever for further extensions of roll-over provisions for changes of ownership of shares following takeovers or mergers of companies. I know that that is not in the amendment but it is a step in that direction which somebody at some time might try to use as a precedent for further extension, which I presume the Australian Democrats at least-I am not so sure about the Opposition-do not support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Yencken case, it is not clear from the representations made to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) whether the surrender of the lease was voluntary, whether it was compulsory, or whether there was a threat of compulsion behind it. I understand that in that specific case part of the lease has been or will be surrendered and an alternative area of land immediately adjacent to the other part of the lease will be provided in lieu. The portion of the original landholding which was retained would, of course, be rolled over but the new portion would not be. I guess that will change if this amendment is carried. It is quite clear that the Opposition and the Democrats are supporting it. The Government does not accept it, but I will not bother to call a division for the reasons stated before. </PARA>

<PARA> 3. Page 34, clause 46, proposed paragraph 160zzma (1) (a), line 30, leave out ``after 28 January 1988'', insert ``on or after 20 September 1985''. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this relates to a matter I brought up in the second reading debate. Clause 46 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) extends the roll-over provisions to assets indirectly owned by the transferors. It actually affects people whose marriages broke down during a specific period, namely, between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988. Any transfer of property that took place prior to 20 September 1985 would not have attracted a capital gains tax because no capital gains tax applied in these sorts of areas pre-September 1985. Post-28 January 1988, which is the period this legislation covers, the same will apply. However, obviously some marriages have been dissolved in the intervening period. Court orders have been made for the transfer of property wholly owned by one spouse to the other spouse by way of distributing the property as a consequence of that divorce. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where the problem has arisen. Some people have been caught up in this situation. If the owner of the property-we are talking about property owned prior to the introduction of capital gains tax-disposed of it, no capital gains tax would accrue because the property was in the hands of that individual when capital gains tax was not applicable on the sale of the property. If between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988 a court order required that that property be transferred to the other spouse in the marriage that has now broken down and that spouse disposes of the property, a capital gains tax will apply because, although the marital property is being shared up through the Family Court system, the transfer is regarded as a change of ownership and hence capital gains tax accrues. Presumably, if the owner of the property sold it and the money was then handed over, no capital gains tax would apply and everything would be fine. But because the property is being handed over and then sold, the spouse-it is usually the wife in this case; when an individual owns property it is usually the male rather than the female--</PARA>

I do not know whether the court takes that into account and says, `We will give her a bit extra because when she disposes of this property it is going to be taxed'. In any event, the roll-over provisions as they apply have left this anomaly. Our amendment simply corrects this, so whether it is pre-20 September 1985, post-28 January 1986 or any period in between, any property which has been owned prior to the September 1985 date and is transferred through court orders in marital breakdowns will not be subject to capital gains tax. That means that three groups of people now involved in these transactions in the case of marital breakdowns will be treated fairly, equitably and, indeed, identically.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, but I did not speak on it. There is a famous case in Western Australia, which I will not name as it would embarrass the woman concerned. I spoke about it last night. A marriage broke down after 40 years. The woman could have hauled a lot of money out of a business and probably could have taken her husband to the cleaners, which would have wound the business up, but she decided to have mercy on him and take some property that was in a trust or some sort of equity. She took that instead of hauling money out of the business. She was happy, and the business kept going. But, obviously, such a matter, as Senator Haines has pointed out, is caught in the status of a losing capital gains situation. I understand that if there had been a court order to the effect that property owned by the husband be transferred to the wife, that would not be covered. In other words, it would still remain in a status free situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some unknown reason the Government has now sought to fix the situation up with roll-over relief on all the other things we have spoken of and has taken it retrospectively to 1985-except the case that has been mentioned in this chamber, the Yencken case in Melbourne, where the boundaries did not quite fit. That has been fixed up retrospectively to 1985. Strangely enough, with the breakdown of marriage, where the spouse took out property from some sort of equity, the Government did not seem to address that. I ask the following questions: Did the Government simply not think about this? Did it see it but choose to ignore it? Or did it do it deliberately?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fair enough. Senator Haines kept saying that this was because of a court order. I might be ignorant of the case, but I would like to be assured that this provision does not cover even property that is not the subject of a court order; in other words, two human beings sitting down, after 40 years, and deciding to split the property that way without a court order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Outside of that, I think this is probably the biggest anomaly in any taxation amendment Bill that I have seen since I have been a member of this place. It certainly needs addressing, because, as I said last night, the marriage concerned broke down after only about 2 1/2 years. It is bad enough that marriages break down, anyhow, without the parties having this sort of matter hanging over their heads in time to come. It will only come to a head when the property is disposed of. If that spouse I mentioned, the woman-it could have been the husband who got the settlement-hangs on to the property for the rest of her life, she may not suffer the consequences. But in all probability, people in such a position may wish to dispose of the property. I think that that problem should be lifted from them. I would like to hear what the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has to say about what the Government will do about the situation. Also, how did the Government miss this anomaly?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, the amendment will only be applicable pursuant to either an order of the Family Court of Australia or a maintenance agreement approved of by the court, because that is what is written in clause 46 in the Bill. The Government is opposing this proposed amendment on a number of grounds, not the least of which is that it introduces a further significant complication into the administration and application of a capital gains tax law and because there are potential winners and losers on a fairly arbitrary or chance basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, a spouse would gain under these circumstances where an asset to be transferred was acquired by the company before the commencement date of the capital gains tax in September 1985 and was transferred to the spouse on 1 January 1988. Clause 46 as drafted in the Bill provides that the company is not liable to capital gains tax at the time of transfer to the spouse and the spouse is taken to receive the asset at market value and liable for gain on subsequent disposal. That is a circumstance where the spouse could be disadvantaged, I suppose. If it were to operate in accordance with the proposed amendment, the company would not be liable to capital gains tax at the time of transfer to the spouse and the spouse would not be liable to capital gains tax on subsequent disposal. The reaction to that might well be, `Well, that is a good thing; they are better off as a pair'. Senator Stone once said that all other taxpayers are worse off. He said it in a slightly different context, I might add. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh yes; I am sure he will not deny it either. Even if he does deny it, it is not only on the public record, it is published in the proceedings of the Agricultural Outlook Conference of 1981, I think it was. I do not want to be held to the complete accuracy of the date, but the accuracy of, I think, the quotation, or certainly the sense of it, I am willing to be judged by. However, there are conceivable circumstances under which applying clause 46 retrospectively, from 20 September 1985, will disadvantage a spouse-for example, where an asset to be transferred was acquired by a company on or after 29 September 1985 and transferred to the spouse on 1 January. As the clause is drafted in the Bill, the company would pay capital gains tax on the excess of market value over indexed cost base at the time of transfer to the spouse, and the spouse would acquire the asset at market value and be liable to pay capital gains tax on subsequent disposal. The spouse is not liable for capital gains tax on the accrued gain, if there is any, during the period the asset was held by the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Australian Democrats' proposed amendment, the company would pay no capital gains tax at the time of transfer to the spouse and the spouse would acquire the asset at the indexed cost base and be liable to pay capital gains tax on subsequent disposal. So it can break either for or against the spouse depending on the circumstance of the particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the position of the taxpayers who have an interest in the company or the trust which has transferred the asset to the spouse. I want to stress this point because it shows that the acceptance of this amendment would impose in a retrospective way the capital gains tax liability on some shareholders or equity holders which does not at present exist. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. Clause 46-that is, in the existing Bill-proposes to reduce the cost base of any interest in the company/trust to account for the loss of the asset; the company/trust is less valuable because the asset has gone. The cost base is used to calculate any gain on disposal for capital gains tax purposes. But retrospectively applying clause 46 from September 1985 could result in an increase in the capital gains tax liability of a taxpayer who disposes of the interest in the company or trust, where that interest of the individual was acquired on or after September 1985, and the asset is transferred from the company or the trust between September 1985 and 28 January 1988-I am not sure whether that should be 1 January, but it does not really affect the point. The cost base otherwise used in the capital gains tax calculation would, in all probability, have to be reduced by the operation of clause 46, thereby increasing capital gains tax liability. This could be particularly unfair if the taxpayer had disposed of the interest before 29 January 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That might sound a bit complicated. I think there is a more simple way of expressing the point, which was put to me yesterday. Let us assume there is a family company, which owns a valuable yacht, and there is a marriage break-up. If the spouse took the yacht out of the company, it would devalue the shares in the company because one of the company's assets would have gone. Under the provisions of the Bill, and given the stipulated timing of acquisition and disposal, the values of the remaining shares in the company would be deflated for capital gains tax purposes or for establishing a capital gains tax base. Therefore, any ultimate capital gains tax liability would be assessed from a lower base. If Senator Haines's amendment were to be carried, a consequential or potential capital gains tax liability would be assessed from a higher base, that is, the valuation of the shares before some of the assets of the company escaped from the ownership of the company, thereby effectively imposing retrospectively either a capital gains tax liability, where none would previously have existed, or a higher capital gains tax liability than would otherwise have applied. For all of those reasons the Government will not accept the amendment. I regard it as being important enough to call a division on the question if the Opposition and the Australian Democrats persist in pursuing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I would like to get away from what I might call the convoluted logic of the Australian Taxation Office on these matters. I do not say that with disrespect. The Taxation Office has its job to do, and it does it. I am not here to criticise it for doing so, but it is the job of this Parliament to do rather more than the job of the narrow interpretation of the law as it stands. That is the job of the Taxation Office. What this clause is directed to is a very distressing-I think that is the best word to use-situation which has arisen as a result of defective drafting in the initial drafting of the capital gains tax legislation. As a result, a situation has arisen where transferee spouses in situations where family breakup has occurred, and where the Family Court of Australia has ordered that a transfer of assets should be made-assets in this case held indirectly as distinct from directly by the transferor spouse-have not been covered by the original capital gains tax legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government to its credit-and I acknowledge that fully-in the light of representations it has received has agreed to amend the law to rectify that initial drafting oversight. So far, both sides of this chamber would agree on the proposed course of action. But what has been pointed out by Senator Haines who has moved an amendment which the Opposition is supporting, and both the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia, is that the Government's amendment simply does not go far enough. It leaves a most unfortunate lacuna in the law. It does not cover the period between 20 September 1985, the date from which the capital gains tax became effective, and 21 January 1988, which was the date on which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that this rectification of the initial oversight would be made. </PARA>

I thought it might not be entirely women, but let us say it is women in 98 per cent of cases. I agree with Senator Haines. They might be affected by this initial gap in the Government's legislation. What should be done about that situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has read at some length from a briefing document-I am sure it is a perfectly good briefing document-provided to him by the Australian Taxation Office, as to why in the Government's opinion this should not be done. In doing so he has pointed to the fact that if Senator Haines's amendment were to be carried there would possibly be some people who would actually be adversely affected by that outcome. I must confess, because this is a new thought to me, as I imagine it is also to Senator Haines-I see her nodding-that I have not addressed my mind to the very hard cases because, after all, these are all hard cases covered by the points made by the Minister. But I am prepared to accept, for the sake of the debate, that there are such exceedingly rare but nevertheless very hard cases. But the Minister is seeking to persuade the chamber that because these exceedingly hard cases exist we should not adopt Senator Haines's amendment, which is entirely supported by the coalition parties, because if we did so we would in fact disadvantage a few cases. The point of the amendment, of course, is to advantage the majority of hard cases.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest we should keep our eyes on the main game, to use a phrase much beloved by the Treasurer. The main game so far as this clause is concerned involves unfortunate spouses, mainly women, who have been severely disadvantaged by the Government's defective drafting of the initial capital gains tax legislation. The purpose of the amendment is to rectify that disadvantage in the case of the majority of such disadvantaged people. The Minister has said to us that, if we carry that amendment, while it will certainly rectify the situation for those unfortunate spouses, mainly women, it will have-and I accept the Minister's technical advice-the effect of disadvantaging a few particularly hard cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that the Government will oppose this amendment, and it will be to its shame if it does. I say to the Government, `Do not come in here and tell us that we should not support this amendment because a few people will be disadvantaged if we do'. Why does not the Government come into this chamber with its own amendment, better perhaps, I hope Senator Haines will not mind my saying, and technically more perfect than the one she has put forward, which will not only achieve the objective we want to achieve, but, in doing so, not produce a deleterious consequence, the unintended consequence-again, a phrase much beloved by the Prime Minister of this country-to which the Minister has just pointed?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government persists in its decision to oppose this amendment, not only will it do great damage to the cause of a number of disadvantaged people-the Minister for Finance having left the chamber, I see that the Minister at the table is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Reynolds), who above all people in this chamber ought to be sympathetic to the cause being pursued by this side of the chamber-but also it will rebound most unfavourably on the Government in terms of the public perception of where the Government stands on this matter. I should like to hear further on this matter from the Minister who is now at the table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate whichever Treasury officer or Australian Taxation Office guru it was who came up with the rather tortuous, complicated example showing who was likely to be disadvantaged should this amendment be passed. I am merely a humble politician; I do not have access to all the information that tax officers do, and so, although I did not quite come to terms with what I was being told, I accept that there may be, as Senator Stone said, one or two rather extraordinary cases in which some disadvantage will accrue. However, again as he said, if that is the case and the Government has realised this, it is surely up to the Government to come into this place and give us the correcting mechanism. We can be absolutely sure, however, notwithstanding fanciful examples which, as I said, I accept to be correct, that if clause 46 is enacted in its current form it will be clearly discriminatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment we are looking at three groups of people. Under clause 46, if it is passed in its present form, two groups will be winners and a group which is currently losing will continue to lose. There are the people whose marriages broke down prior to 20 September 1985. They do not face the problem of capital gains tax (CGT) being paid when the property transferred from one spouse to another spouse is disposed of, because no capital gains tax applied prior to that date. Then there are the people whose marriages are breaking down and who have court orders distributing property post-28 January 1988. In the event of the resale of such property because the person receiving it needs cash rather than simply an asset, those people will not be disadvantaged because the law covers them as clause 46 stands. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who are going to be affected are the people whose marriages broke down or, more accurately, whose divorce proceedings were concluded, between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988, because in the event of property owned by one spouse that was owned by that spouse prior to September 1985, when CGT was introduced, being transferred to the other spouse and then disposed of, the recipient spouse is going to be facing capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have three groups of families whose marriages have broken down, only one of which will be subject to CGT. That is clearly discriminatory. I am not at all sure that the Government did this intentionally. I cannot believe that it would. I do not believe that there are hundreds of thousands of families so affected, but there are some, and they deserve to be treated as equitably as people whose marriages broke up both before and after theirs. As I said a moment ago, in concert with Senator Stone I would say to the Government: if clarifying clause 46 to end the discrimination which is patently there is going to cause an even smaller group of people to be disadvantaged, the onus is on the Government to come into this chamber and say how that can be fixed up. Frankly, I would be very surprised if more than two Western Australian multimillionaires were likely to be picked up under clause 46 as amended by the Australian Democrats amendment, but one must have sympathy, if not for the multimillionaires, at least for the spouses left with a broken marriage. If there are such people, and if the Tax Office knows of cases in which people will be disadvantaged by this amendment, the Government should amend the amendment, produce its own additional amendment. The matters I have outlined should not be used as an excuse to oppose this amendment, which ends a clear discrimination against a group of people who were unfortunate enough to be divorced and to have their property settlements arranged between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a serious matter. The Minister gave some examples to show that, if a marriage breakdown occurred between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988-for instance, in 1987-property forming part of the equity and bought after 20 September 1985, when the capital gains tax came in, which was gained by a trust between those dates would be liable for capital gains tax when it was sold. I think he gave the example that it was taxable in the hands of the equity, with the trust. If that is the case and if that is what the Minister is worried about then surely, as I told Senator Haines earlier, someone from the Australian Democrats or the Government can come up with a different amendment even if it means adjourning this debate until tomorrow until someone can work it out. Surely they can come up with an amendment to cover the marriages that broke down between capital gains day and 28 January 1988 and make sure that the property was held before the capital gains day of 1985. If that is what the Minister for Finance is worried about-and I can see his point that there can be some rorts made out of it when a marriage broke down in 1987-surely it is not beyond the ability of some draftsman to come up with the right amendment to cover those whose marriages broke down after capital gains day and whose property was owned in that trust before capital gains day. I repeat that this debate should be adjourned until someone comes up with the right amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

But surely a court has to make the final dissolution of a marriage and a tax rort is not considered. I appeal to the Government to look at it again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his own pithy way Senator Panizza has put his finger on the issue here. This matter is about people being caught in a circumstance which is apparently now being well and truly used against them in this tax legislation. They are in circumstances over which they have no control. On the other hand, the Government does have control and does have the power to amend the legislation so as to release these people from the situation into which they have fallen. The key point is that we have people who have come to an agreement in the financial settlement of their affairs in some belief-mistaken as it may have been-that the roll-over provisions of the capital gains tax legislation applied to all assets whether they are directly or indirectly held at the time of the distribution when the marriage was dissolved. That is the critical point. That is what the Government ought to be acknowledging here tonight. It fails to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Earlier in the debate on the committee stage of the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988 Opposition senators argued that the Bill should be amended to clarify the powers of the Treasurer under clause 7 of the Bill. Clause 7 of the Bill is intended to make it a condition of the payment of general revenue grants for the States that all States should adhere to the global borrowing limits agreed to at the May Loan Council meeting by all States except Queensland. The Treasurer may reduce grants to any State exceeding those limits. The Government believes that the clause as drafted fulfils that intention and will not allow the Treasurer to reduce grants to a State unless it exceeded its global borrowing limits in respect of those types of borrowings covered by the Loan Council arrangement. As I have already indicated to the Senate, the Government has given its assurance to the States that the Bill would be interpreted in that way. However, I am now prepared to propose an amendment which I believe would put the matter beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment expands on the definition of new borrowings given in clause 3 of the Bill to indicate that the new borrowings which are the subject of clause 7 firstly exclude any borrowings from the Commonwealth and secondly include only borrowings that were the subject of the global approach resolution moved at the May Loan Council meeting and agreed to by all States except Queensland other than borrowings for refinancing purposes. This would ensure that new borrowings exclude borrowings by government-owned financial institutions except when those institutions undertake borrowings for the purpose of on-lending to bodies subject to the global borrowing limits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the Minister for Finance for coming up with those amendments. As we point out previously the Opposition and a number of States had been concerned that the effects of the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988 could be to circumvent the present Loan Council agreements. I therefore believe that incorporating how the discretion of the Treasurer was going to be incorporated into the legislation was far preferable to issuing a letter of intent by the Treasurer. These definitional problems, as we point out earlier, led to deficiencies in three principal areas of the Bill. The Government attempted to cover some of these deficiencies by issuing a letter saying how the Treasurer intended to exercise his discretionary powers. We believed that this was not adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The drafting difficulty arose because the binding agreements usually provide for unanimous agreements between all parties. We have some sympathy with the draftsman who had to put together this legislation. Nevertheless, it is a warning to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that Premiers Conferences require agreement and goodwill. I remind the Minister for Finance that Queensland walked out of those negotiations because of the Treasurer's high-handed attitude. I am pleased that the Government has finally succumbed to a request for an amendment following the use of parliamentary tactics of reporting progress on at least two occasions while the Government deliberated as to how it should deal with the program. The Government could have had its legislation last week because we undertook to agree to those amendments provided that the Minister would in the next month introduce legislation. It is an indication that if there is goodwill on all sides one can get legislation through much more speedily than on a basis of confrontation. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for Finance for what he has now brought forward to the Parliament. </PARA>

Having acknowledged that, I would emphasise that the proposed amendment, which I entirely support, will not address the much more serious policy aspect of clause 7 which has to do with the dictatorial attitude adopted by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his actions or attitudes towards State governments in this area. The fact is that clause 7 gives the Treasurer a totally unfettered discretion to penalise or punish any State which, `in the opinion of the Treasurer'-those are the key words of the clause-borrows beyond the amounts laid down by the Commonwealth and imposed therefore on the States as set out in the tabulation included in clause 7.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax Files Numbers) Bill 1988, to which the Opposition will not be raising objection. In fact we will not oppose it. The history of this piece of legislation is long but it bears consideration by the Parliament as we have reached this stage here tonight. We all know the attempts by the Labor Government back in 1985 at the time of the so-called RATS proposals, the reform of the Australian taxation system, when it was announced that there would be introduced an Australian identification system, known as the Australia card, which would have imposed enormous burdens on the Australian people. This national identifier would have had to be used in just about every financial transaction throughout Australia. It would have been required to be produced in all kinds of ordinary everyday situations in which Australians find themselves. In other words, it would have become very akin to a national passport. We know that that Bill was defeated twice in the Senate, having been sent here by the House of Representatives. The Government thereby caused a double dissolution election to occur last year. Finally, the Bill was reintroduced by the Government but before it was put to the vote in the Senate again it was withdrawn by the Government because of technical failures in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill we now have before us relates to a tax file numbering system. This is an entirely different approach which the Government has outlined. It is different because it does not require people to carry with them any kind of card that indicates their tax file number (TFN) whenever they are carrying on their ordinary everyday affairs. It does not require them to produce a tax file number in respect of ordinary bank transactions, for instance; it does not require them to produce it in respect of buying and selling any kind of property. The tax file number system, as envisaged by this legislation-and the history of how this legislation came to be is a story in itself which I shall come to in a moment-is in no way a copy of the Australia card. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a time, when the Government was first proposing this legislation six or eight months ago, when one could think that it was to be that kind of `son of ID card' legislation. We could see that the Government had in mind achieving the same end that it failed to do with the ID card legislation by the substitution of that with this tax file numbering system. For instance, the Government proposed that if a person did not produce a tax file number to a bank when withdrawing money or transacting on the account, the bank account would be frozen, that people would lose access to their own funds. That kind of nonsense had to be dealt with and it fell very early in the race as a result of discussions between Senator Stone, Mr Peacock and Mr Tuckey, on behalf of the Opposition, and the Commissioner of Taxation in about June this year. The Government was prepared to look at alternatives, and that point was established at that stage. Quite clearly, the TFN system, which was seen at that point to be a copy of the ID card, was rapidly adopting another face. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government first announced that it would proceed with a tax file numbering system in substitution of the ID card system, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, laid down three conditions which had to be met for the tax file numbering legislation to gain the support of the Liberal and National parties. Those three points were: firstly, the Government would need to demonstrate that the tax file numbering system would effectively eliminate tax fraud and welfare cheating; secondly, the new system would be cost-effective-quite clearly, the ID card system was not cost effective; we all remember that it was going to cost about $2,000m to set it up-and, thirdly, the tax file numbering system did not unreasonably intrude upon personal privacy and individual civil liberties. Those were the three conditions laid down by the Leader of the Opposition then and they have been the guiding principles by which we in the Opposition have determined our attitude on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the first guideline, on effectively eliminating tax fraud, we can see that the Government has an argument for instituting a system whereby a number can be traced, within the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and through other arms of government, in order to prevent welfare cheating and tax fraud. We believe that that could and would be used within those restricted and confined circumstances to ensure that people are not able to rip off the system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us deal with one thing at a time. The audit practice adopted within the ATO is becoming more and more a part of the ATO's effort to stamp out tax evasion, as distinct from tax avoidance, and the numbering system appears, on all the evidence that has been produced to Estimates committees and in other forums, such as the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to be a reasonably effective way of ensuring that the ATO has a far more effective audit system. That point came out particularly in the Estimates committee debates in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of cost-effectiveness, obviously the institution of this system will cost a great deal less than the $2,000m monster identified with the Australia Card. It has nothing in common with the Australia Card in terms of its widespread nature. At the time the Government was talking about introducing such legislation there was considerable concern, and there still is, among people about individual civil liberties. Obviously, the Government had headed down the wrong track when it announced that it intended to introduce a tax file numbering Bill without the accompanying privacy legislation. In other words, it intended to set up the TFN system and then at some future time, when it had had time to think about it, it would bring in a privacy Bill. Quite clearly, that had to be thrown out as being an attempt to sell the people of Australia a pig in a poke. The Australian people would not buy that kind of chicanery from the Hawke Government given its present standing. Consequently, we would have moved to oppose the legislation had not the Government acceded to many of the conditions that we brought to bear in the course of discussions with it on the format of the proposed privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Neil Brown, the shadow Attorney-General, undertook long negotiations with the Government on the privacy legislation to ensure that the new tax file numbering system would be quarantined to those very specific purposes for which this legislation now shows itself to be designated. It is designed to attack tax and welfare fraud and is not to be used or to become in any way, possibly, a kind of internal passport. That privacy legislation will be discussed in this place by my colleague Senator Hill. It is separate legislation but will be debated cognately with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill. Suffice it to say that what the Opposition was able to do in achieving significant changes in the privacy legislation has assured the Australian people that the tax file numbering system will not affect their civil liberties, that it will be limited and quarantined to a narrow range of circumstances and that, as a result, it will not become the kind of monster that the ID card was designed to be. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the proposed system differs significantly from that which the majority of members of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card recommended about 18 months or two years ago. The tax file numbering system recommended by those members of the Parliament at that time was designed to be a replacement for the ID card-a simpler, less costly version of the ID card, if you like. It was not designed along the lines of the proposed tax file numbering system, which has a very different approach and a purpose totally different and much more limited. For that reason we cannot even compare the outcome of the report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card with what is before us. They are two different things and in no way can we seek to argue from the point of view adopted by those four or five members of that Committee who recommended the acceptance of a tax file numbering system in place of the ID card. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are one or two dangers that need to be watched in the course of this legislation being implemented. We all know that section 16 of the income tax law, which is a very important section, defines the duties of officers of the Taxation Office and provides for the distribution of information from the Tax Office to other government departments, and vice versa, including the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and, I think, the Department of Community Services and Health. Quite clearly, for means testing purposes and other purposes associated with the detection of fraud, those organisations will have and should have access to that kind of information from the Taxation Office. The fear I express tonight is that once that information is provided by the Tax Office to those outside organisations, the secrecy systems of those organisations may well be breached in the way that information originating with the Tax Office flows out to other people in the community. In other words, there may not be the same concern on the part of departments outside the Tax Office as there is within the Tax Office over matters of secrecy and civil liberties. I think the privacy legislation extends significantly to cover those situations, and I hope that all people can guarantee that that will be so. It just seems to me that we must be extraordinarily vigilant about that aspect in case there is any leak of information from those sources. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar circumstance may apply in relation to the private sector, where information comes into the hands of private sector organisations such as banks and other financial institutions. They must comply with the present legislation. The privacy provisions must extend adequately to ensure that there can be no leaks from those organisations. If the law fails to be properly applied or it is not enforced properly, dangers may arise. Again, I emphasise that we must be vigilant in that area to ensure that those circumstances do not occur and that we do not end up having funnels for people's private and personal information to be channelled out of the Taxation Office into other areas of the community. We in the Liberal and National parties are satisfied that the privacy legislation covers these situations adequately. As a result, we are prepared to give support to the legislation. That deals with the three main factors which the Leader of the Opposition announced last November we would be taking into account in assessing whether or not we would give support to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In debating the legislation it is perhaps necessary to consider some of the alternatives that might be available to the Australian Taxation Office and the Government in seeking to stamp out welfare and tax fraud. Perhaps other measures could be put in place, rather than relying on what may be only a partially effective system using the tax file number. The alternatives that could possibly be adopted include such things as a mandatory withholding tax on all capital sourced income. There would be some technical difficulties in relation to dividends which are fully franked and other matters like that, but it is not necessary to consider those details here. The general point is that such a tax could be applied and that, of course, is the system that applies in some other countries of the world, particularly Britain. Perhaps ultimately that would be the most effective system. However, I do not believe that it is feasible in this country, given its widespread geographical nature and the difficulties of instituting such a system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another alternative would be simply to build up the computer capacity of the Taxation Office so as to ensure that there was better matching of individual transactions as they are recorded in the books of individual financial institutions with those amounts that are declared as income in the hands of various taxpayers. But a very large scale operation would need to be instituted in order to achieve that. There is also the question of whether it could be effective. Some countries have very good matching systems. The British system is a typical example. But those systems are not necessarily foolproof or cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps another solution to this problem would be simply to limit the application of the tax file number to only internal activities within the Australian Tax Office, and not to apply it more generally to other agencies of government. That again has its limitations, quite obviously, because it would fail on one of the criteria we laid down; that is, seeking to control welfare fraud. Obviously that is no easy answer either. Another possibility emerged, I think, from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I refer to the minority report of the Australian Democrats. They envisaged some kind of paper system whereby reports of individual transactions in quadruplicate form would be forwarded by the financial institutions to the Australian Taxation Office. In that way there would be a capacity for the Taxation Office to match directly those individual transactions with the affairs of the taxpayer. Quite apart from the fact that this seems to miss the point of the tax file number, I do not believe such a system could be managed. It would result in literally mountains of paper being transferred from one office to another and coping with such a proposal would require a massive effort on the part not only of government but also of the private sector. I do not believe that one stands up. </PARA>
<PARA> There does not seem to be readily available the kind of practical alternative that could be easily implemented in order to attack capital sourced taxation fraud and also, of course, employment fraud where there are multiple registrations of the same person under different names. The tax file numbering system offers the advantage of ensuring that, with proper identification in the first place, people can be traced in the event of their defrauding the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that there be no requirement on the part of any individual to quote his tax file number in any circumstance; nor is there a requirement for any financial institution to request or require any individual to quote his number. In other words, in relation to capital sourced and employment areas, there is no compulsion on individuals to disclose their numbers. That is, of course, totally different from the approach that was adopted with the Australia Card legislation, under which this was mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, the requirement for financial institutions and employers who are paying wages or capital sourced income to taxpayers, in the event that the tax file number is not quoted, to apply a withholding tax at the maximum marginal rate of taxation for individuals. We support that for two reasons: firstly, the withholding tax is ultimately the only really safe anti-fraud device, and, consequently, this answers the first point in the statement of the Leader of the Opposition last year; that the system should be shown to be effective. Secondly, people have the choice of not paying tax at the maximum marginal rate by simply quoting their tax file number if they so wish. However, in the event of their not wishing to disclose their number, for various privacy reasons or whatever, a withholding tax will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people might argue that somehow there is a penalty in tax being deducted at the maximum marginal rate, but I think we have to remember that it is not so much a question of the tax deducted going into a black hole and never being seen again. Rather, it is, if you like, a prepayment of tax because a taxpayer's liability will be ultimately decided when he submits his taxation return. He will then receive credit for the withholding tax that has already been taken out in respect of either employment earnings or capital sourced earnings. That kind of concession, if it is regarded as such, takes the sting out of the situation. It is simply a matter of a timing difference, of tax being paid in advance rather than being applied per se in circumstances over which taxpayers ultimately have no control. In fact, they will be able to have control by submitting their income tax returns. They will then receive a credit for whatever tax has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out-and this is the most important point of all as far as the Liberal and National parties are concerned-that we have negotiated long and hard with the Government over this legislation to attain success with the three objectives that have been laid down. We had a good look at all the alternatives to the tax file numbering system. We negotiated with the Government and obtained its agreement for a voluntary system and for all compulsion to be removed from the legislation. Sure, the sanction ultimately lies with the application of the withholding tax but, ultimately, the only alternative is the kind of system that we are seeing applied here in this legislation. That is why we have given our support to the Government. We put the Government on notice that we will be watching vigilantly for any breaches of privacy and for any failures in the systems that are being written to the privacy legislation. We will be examining very closely any representations from people who feel aggrieved by the Government's system. I hope that the privacy legislation, which will be dealt with later in the debate by my colleague Senator Hill, adequately covers the circumstances in which people can find redress for any complaints they may have. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I point out that this is the most effective system to stop tax evasion and welfare fraud that we have yet seen put forward. It is a shame that the Government did not adopt a far more cooperative approach in relation to a system such as this, quite distinct from the shameful identification card system that it announced off the top of its head back in 1985 after the tax summit. This kind of system could well have engendered a great deal of different feeling in the community from that which the identity card created. We have to note that the new system will not represent an internal passport in Australia. Function creep, if you like, will be significantly protected by the privacy legislation. That privacy legislation has been put in place because of pressure from the Liberal and National parties and the negotiations that have been undertaken with the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). The system will be entirely voluntary-again, an initiative of the Liberal and National parties. People can choose either to disclose their numbers or not. There is no penalty-no offence is created-as a result of the number not being disclosed. A person can make a decision whether to pay tax now through the withholding tax system or to pay it later by disclosing his tax file number. In that way there is no intrusion, no interference with people's rights. People are left in a circumstance they were in before, except, of course, for the timing of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, we believe that this system will improve the operation of the Australian Taxation Office. We believe that it will improve the effectiveness of the Tax Office's audit system which it is moving to very rapidly. We believe it will counter tax evasion and welfare fraud. For those reasons we support the legislation. As I indicated earlier, we will look very vigilantly for any breaches of the undertakings given by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that we on the Government side note the generally constructive approach that has been taken by Senator Messner and, presumably, his colleagues, towards the introduction of a tax file number which, in its present form, apparently meets with the approval of the Opposition and overcomes its previous objections to at least some aspects of the use of this identifier. It has never been claimed that the tax file number is a fool proof system or that it would rake in every cent of avoided tax. As we know, the tax file number was the preferred option of members of the Opposition who served not so long ago on the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite Senator Messner's claim to the contrary, I think there is enough similarity between this proposition and what was being advocated in general terms at that stage as a tax file number for me to make that claim. In any case, I believe that it is an opinion which is shared by the vast majority of Australian taxpayers, who have had a tax file number for years and who are not aware of any great disadvantages as a result. Some of us have actually had a tax file number for decades; and fewer still possibly for generations. The extension of use of the tax file number seems to me to be a commonsense measure. I believe it will even more cut down the capacity of individuals to avoid their obligations in respect of the income tax they should be paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this is one of many of the measures that have been taken by this Government. I remind the Senate that the Cash Transaction Reports Act took effect from 1 July. As a result of that legislation, it is now obligatory for banks and other financial institutions to report cash transactions of amounts over $10,000. There is an obligation also to report large amounts of money leaving or entering the country. Perhaps most significant of all, it is now illegal to open or operate an account in anybody's name but one's own. An indication of the extent to which that piece of legislation was needed is the anecdotal evidence of up to 10 per cent of accounts being closed in a great hurry towards the end of the last financial year. A few people in the community still have a philosophical objection towards any numbering system, but that seems to me to ignore the facts of life. We have been using numbers as identifiers for a very long time because of their utility value. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the feasibility of a national identification scheme-the tax file number-we had it put to us that it was somehow dehumanising to identify people by substituting numbers for names. Of course, this proposal does not substitute numbers for names; we keep our names, with all their lack of utility. It was interesting that some of the people who put these positions most forcefully were those with names that would be replicated quite a number of times, even in a country such as Australia with its small population. There are probably at least a dozen Pat Gileses in Australia. I have met about half a dozen of them. I am very happy to have the taxation, social security and whatever other records are actually mine pertain to me-those which are legitimately mine. I believe this is a commonsense approach taken by the majority of Australians, who have nothing whatsoever to fear from being clearly identified for who they are, for how much they earn, and for how much they are obliged to pay in income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the Committee's discussion about identification we received some evidence in relation to the regularisation of our births, deaths and marriages records. Some of the criticism I have seen of the report of the Committee goes to the fact that we were not making any firm recommendations about ways in which those registers might be upgraded and standardised across the nation. It is a particular wish of mine to have a far more reliable system whereby births, deaths and marriages can be recorded much more accurately than they are at present and access for individuals with legitimate reasons for access made a great deal easier. </PARA>
<PARA> Along the way we have noted with great interest the concerns expressed that a tax file number should not be used for purposes other than those related to the collection of taxation. As we said in the last recommendation of the Standing Committee, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, if enacted, should be strictly limited in its terms so that it applies only for taxation purposes and that those purposes be so framed as to prevent a progressive extension of the ambit of the Bill. As I understand it, the Government is perfectly happy to accede to that recommendation, with the clear understanding that other purposes for which it is considered completely legitimate to use the tax file number in its proposed form would be very closely related to income and to ways in which that income is legitimately a concern of the Government, not only for income tax but also to assist with the assessment of incomes for means testing Austudy payments to assist students in secondary and post-secondary education, and to assist in the implementation of our child support levy. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter levy is one that can work a great deal more effectively in conjunction with a tax file number. Once again, speaking personally, ever since we started to discuss the possibility of introducing a universal tax file number-I should not use that word `universal' because it is not obligatory-it has been my sincere hope that such a number would be introduced in order to make it a great deal more efficient within the taxation system to collect maintenance from non-custodial parents in a scheme whereby we pass on that maintenance to custodial parents. Obviously, where the tax file number is as widely used as we could possibly anticipate, we would be in a far better position to assist custodial parents to track down the errant non-custodial parent. We would also be in a position to know exactly how much income was available for distribution to the non-custodial parent, to collect it, and to ensure that the welfare of the children involved was being attended to in the best possible way we could manage within that system. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been concern expressed too about the secrecy of the number and its integrity as far as human and technological factors are concerned. We have taken every possible precaution in this legislation to ensure that the much vaunted and highly regarded secrecy of the Australian Taxation Office is maintained. There are very heavy penalties for disclosure by anybody who has access to the tax file number in the course of his or her employment in the Taxation Office or any other government instrumentality. Those penalties will also apply to people who have access to the tax file numbers as a result of their employment in banks and other financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is no way that we can ensure with 100 per cent certainty that nobody will ever breach these laws, but if people do break the law they are up for heavy penalties and they will be taking a very great risk with their reputations. This is one of the points that should be made in relation to all the measures we are taking for the much more effective collection of taxation. We cannot be certain that laws will never be breached, but we can be certain that we are making that window of opportunity smaller as we hedge these measures around with very heavy penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Reservations were expressed by both Opposition and Government members about the amount of money that would be collected as a result of introducing a tax file number. We found that the Australian Taxation Office could not be precise; did not have particularly large samples from which to work and seemed to be making a few assumptions that could be questioned. We discussed with the Taxation Office other ways of making its records more accurate, more useful, without using numbers. The point was made very clearly that computer-based name and address matching was very difficult for a whole range of reasons, one of the most important being, as I have mentioned, that names are not so different as to be easily picked up. In the same families the same initials keep cropping up time and time again. People are not always identified by their full given names. For companies, and particularly partnerships and trusts, it is considered too difficult and no attempts have been made to devise a computer-based matching program. Thus in excess of one million business taxpayers who derive interest income are excluded from the interest reporting and matching element of the income matching program, with very large implications in dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also estimated that at least 400,000 to 500,000 taxable persons failed to report group certificates and it was not practicable to include the bulk of unreported group certificates in the income matching program for several reasons, one of them being that in many cases there would be no tax payable-there might even be a rebate waiting for a whole lot of those people who failed to report their group certificate-but in many cases, as we are coming to realise more clearly, a high proportion of those group certificates would be in false names. In addition, a high level of income reports-that is, over four million in the 1986 program run in November 1987-captured by the income matching program could not be uniquely matched and require labour intensive follow up action. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account this range of limitations for any sort of computer based matching, or the manual matching and the enormous cost and labour intensiveness of that type of matching, the tax file number was seen to be not only a great deal more effective, but also more cost effective than the estimate that was given to us of 1 : 8.07. Despite the fact that we were not convinced of the accuracy of the Australian Tax Office's calculations, they must be weighed up against the Tax Office's past record of significantly underestimating the revenue yield of base broadening measures such as that now proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a table illustrating the original estimate of the revenue yield for the 1985 base broadening measures announced by the Government and the actual outcome. In every case the revenue yield has been substantially greater than first estimated. It could be estimated that, if anything, the Tax Office's calculation of the costs of implementing the upgraded tax file number is likely to have been overstated for two reasons. Firstly, as a consequence of the ATO's tax modernisation project it is expected that major productivity improvements will be possible when new systems on new equipment become operational in the early 1990s, and this particularly applies to the income matching activity which is at the heart of the tax file number legislation. The other reason is that since the Cabinet decision to proceed with the tax file number legislation, the scope of the proposals has been narrowed by decisions varying the tax file number quotation requirements in respect of pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> One result of these decisions will be to reduce our previous cost estimates, but with minimal impact on the revenue estimates. We believe that the upgrading of the tax file number will produce a cost benefit ratio of 1 : 8 at least in its first 10 years; that is, revenue over 10 years to 1998 are $2.258 billion, whereas costs over 10 years to 1998 are $280m. Moreover, when the system is fully operational from 1994 it is likely to return a cost-benefit ration of 1 : 13, annual revenues of $337m versus annual costs of $25m, bearing in mind that we expect the system to become more efficient all the time. All evidence and past experience suggests that the actual results achieved will be significantly better than this. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of what we calculate to be the results of the estimates of the base broadening measures introduced by the Government which shows quite clearly that the actual result has considerably outweighed what was originally estimated. I seek leave to have that document incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BASE BROADENING REVENUE</PARA>
<PARA> Estimates of revenue from the various base broadening measures introduced by the Government have, without exception, substantially understated actual outcomes.

<PARA>(b) The estimate represents a reduced cost to revenue, rather than an addition to gross revenue. There is substantial evidence that claims for entertainment deductions would have been substantially higher in 1987-88 than originally estimated, but for this measure. It is also relevant that company tax collections in 1987-88 were some $1.1 billion higher than the Budget estimate. A substantial amount of this can only be explained by lower deductions than originally estimated, particularly for entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) At the beginning of 1987-88 it was estimated that the substantiation measures would add $200 million to revenue, rather than the original estimate of $105 million. In the outcome, the ATO estimates that substantiation contributed $350 million to revenue in respect of PAYE taxpayers alone. This does not include any revenue gain from the self-employed/professional sector. </PARA>
<PARA>(d) PPS collections in 1987-88 exceeded Budget estimates by $120 million. A substantial part of this can be explained by a higher than anticipated impact of the 1985 measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summary, this is another reform in a long list of reforms by the Hawke Government, which has made our taxation system a great deal more efficient. We inherited a demoralised Taxation Office 5 1/2 years ago. It was desperately short of staff, reeling from years of uncorrected avoidance and evasion and was not seen to be a viable institution except in a very minimal way. In the intervening years we have been able to make an enormous improvement in the morale of the Tax Office. We have increased the staff by about 40 per cent. As I pointed out in the course of my speech, computerisation has greatly increased the effectiveness of the Tax Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the community perception of the Tax Office has changed quite remarkably in that time. I am not saying that everybody in the community is absolutely delighted to pay income tax, but what I do believe is that people on lower and middle incomes feel a great deal better about paying tax when they can be assured that it is not quite so easy for other individuals to avoid their taxation obligations, whether those individuals are people that low and middle income people can identify with easily, or whether they are wealthy or have been able in the past to disguise their incomes as a result of companies or trusts or using false bank accounts or false names. We are gradually reducing the ways in which those people with a great deal of ingenuity have been able over the years to avoid their obligations. The vast majority of Australians approve very strongly of the fact that we have been able to do this, and we have their support. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, it is extremely gratifying to know that members of the Opposition have taken a position which is essentially in line with what we plan to do. We have been able to agree to some amendments that satisfy some of their concerns. The privacy legislation, which will certainly also be discussed in the course of this debate, has been improved, I believe considerably, on what was proposed at the time of the ill-fated Australia Card legislation. What we are offering to the Australian public, what we believe has been our responsibility to develop in response to years of expectation from the public, is a taxation system which has a great deal more integrity and a great deal more respect from the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> We greatly welcome this bipartisan approach for these means of eliminating tax fraud and welfare cheating. Provided that they are cost-effective and allow for protection of personal privacy and civil liberties, the Government believes that it is entitled to the Opposition's support for the tax file number legislation currently before the House, and we welcome that support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite disturbed at a media report earlier this week that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, has promised a Hong Kong-style commission with wide-ranging investigative powers to probe all aspects of corruption in Queensland after the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct concludes. I have no objection to moves to rid Queensland of corruption, not only in the police and justice areas as currently are being thoroughly investigated by the Fitzgerald inquiry, but also at the administrative level in the Queensland Government. Moves to clean up what has become a rotten administration in the State that I represent are well overdue. What I do object to are the suggested wide-ranging powers that could be handed to any investigative body. Queensland is not exactly regarded as a place where civil liberties are safeguarded and promoted. Any further assault on civil liberties in that State must be resisted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The suggestion has been made that new powers to fight corruption will include search and seizure, power to probe personal finances and bank accounts, detention without charge for up to 48 hours and compulsory answering of questions. Instant dismissal of employees without reason has also been suggested. If society is to counter corruption, there must be significant powers to carry out the task. But we must have curbs to ensure that any expanded powers are not abused. Unless there are safeguards, there will be excesses and abuses. I shall turn to that matter later. If some officers-police officers or other government officers-are to be allowed to search and seize and are given a power to probe personal finances and bank accounts, they cannot be allowed to do so of their own volition. They must be compelled to convince responsible persons that such search, seizure and probe of finances is essential. Who should such responsible people be? To my mind they should come from the judiciary-magistrates or judges. And even there, safeguards must exist. It would probably be unreasonable to expect the judiciary to provide a public report of the details of permission given over a particular period, for example, a year. But I do not consider it unreasonable for elected leaders, including the Leader of the Opposition to sight such a report. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard far too many assertions by young people in Queensland that the power of search and seizure under drug laws is being abused by some police officers. It is not difficult to imagine how such abuse could occur. All a police officer has to claim is that his or her investigation relates to drugs, and it follows that powers to search, and perhaps seize, virtually have no bounds. Detention for 48 hours without charge should be unacceptable in Australia. It is far too open to abuse. If citizens are to be deprived of their liberty, they should be aware of the reasons for their incarceration and, if necessary, obtain legal assistance. Any suggestion that such a provision be introduced in this country, albeit in one State only, should be resisted with vigour. The suggestion that it should be possible for employees to be dismissed without reason is also totally unacceptable. In the interest of justice, any person who loses his or her job should know the reason for the loss of the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I earlier mentioned the possibility of excesses and abuses occurring if additional powers were provided to police or other government officers without adequate safeguards. It is my opinion that the vast majority of police officers in the State that I represent are hardworking, dedicated officers who know how far to go with the powers at their disposal. But there are some who, in the heat of the moment or quite deliberately, go beyond the bounds of their powers. I worked in a police department-as a public servant-for only a few years and in most of that time I worked at a desk. Even so, I saw excessive use of power, or perhaps it would be better to say I saw behaviour which went beyond what was acceptable. I saw personal property deliberately damaged; I saw civilians being assaulted without any provocation. I, too, was assaulted by a police officer after I left that department and was a senator. When I complained, one of the knights in shining armour, a certain high ranking officer named Vern McDonald, refused to take action on my complaint. By chance, a photographic record was available of the incident, but it made no difference. I mention these few excesses to illustrate that there must be safeguards to protect ordinary citizens. The introduction of powers such as the ones I mentioned would be a disturbing development. Let us, by all means, fight against corruption at all levels, but in doing so let us have in mind the rights of those whom we intend to protect from that very corruption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity in the adjournment debate to make some brief remarks about a recent visit I made to Eritrea, where a civil war has been fought for the last 26 years. I am, as I understand it, the first Australian parliamentarian to go into what is called the liberated areas of Eritrea which are under the control of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). A couple of members of parliament from other countries visited in the early 1980s, but I am the first Australian member of parliament and I think I am the first parliamentarian from a governing party to visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made the visit privately and unofficially. I do not wish to go into the details of the difficulty of travelling into Eritrea, over rough roads, for a couple of days. But I would like to mention that also travelling to Eritrea at that time was a film crew from the Channel 10 network current affairs program, Page One, and that crew worked under very difficult circumstances to record what was happening in Eritrea. I believe its efforts will be seen on Channel 10's Page One this Thursday evening at 8.30 p.m. It is certainly a program I look forward to watching. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a patron of the Eritrean Relief Association for some months and have been interested in the issue for a number of years. The Australian Labor Party, at the last two national conferences, carried resolutions in support of an act of self-determination for the Eritrean people. The dispute started in the 1950s, when the Emperor Haile Selassie, who was then the ruler of Ethiopia, illegally incorporated Eritrea into Ethiopia contrary to a United Nations mandate. That has been the centre of the dispute. The Eritrean people have ever since been fighting for their independence. They wish to have a political settlement but the Ethiopians refuse to negotiate, so for 26 years this forgotten war has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The war is not just an independence movement. If it were, it could possibly be more easily dismissed. What I was impressed with in my visit to Eritrea of some 10 days is that it is much more than a separatist movement. The Eritrean revolution is about changing existing society. A number of people described it to me as being about the transformation of mental attitudes and the way people think. In an area of Africa where there has been a long history of traditional and feudal thinking, this really is a remarkable effort by the Eritrean people. The other thing that was most marked about the philosophy of their revolution is that they do not use terms such as a Marxist or Leninist revolution. They do not look to the Soviet or Chinese examples or to any other examples. They are making their own revolution. A number of Eritreans I spoke to quite openly said that, when they achieve independence for their country, they will have a multiparty system, a pluralistic system, and a mixed economy. They will not follow the Soviet model, which they see as unsuitable for their circumstance. I point out that from 1962 to 1975 the Soviet Union was supportive of the EPLF, but when the Mengistu coup took place and Haile Selassie was overthrown in Ethiopia, Mengistu, the present leader, declared himself a communist, the Soviet Union swapped sides and is now supporting the Mengistu regime in its war against Eritrea. I will return to that matter in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most intriguing and commendable aspects of the Eritrean revolution is the way the Eritreans have adopted the policy of equality for women. About 50 per cent of the population of Eritrea is of a Christian Coptic background, and the other 50 per cent is of a Moslem background. They are both very traditional societies with very traditional religions, in which women have been subservient through many centuries, yet they have adopted policies where women are guaranteed equal rights with men to own land, the right to divorce and the right to share in all aspects of the running of the society. This is seen, for example, in the fact that 30 per cent of the fighters at the front are women trained equally with men. From all accounts they are equally good fighters as men. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that for me were particularly marked was the fact that the Eritreans are educating their society on the issue of what some people in Australia would call female circumcision or female clitoridectomy. It is a practice which has been going on in this part of Africa for centuries. The EPLF, through education, has campaigned against this practice and has been very successful in both Moslem and Christian families in reducing the practice almost to non-existence. The Eritreans say that they do not force people to reject it and, if a family absolutely insists on the practice, they offer the opportunity to have the operation done medically by properly trained doctors and not by untrained people. That is an example of the extent of the revolution they have created in the way people think in that society. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the war. When I went to Eritrea I was expecting to see a war of a guerilla nature in the traditional sense, and I was startled to find that the war is a conventional war. It is not fought by roving bands of guerillas in the hills; it is fought in a fully fledged conventional sense. One would have thought one was observing a war fought in North Africa or on the Russian front in the Second World War. Both sides have large numbers of tanks and heavy artillery, including rocket launchers called `Stalin organs' and heavy machine guns; large numbers of heavy trucks; all sorts of light armaments; and grenade throwers. The interesting thing is that all the EPLF arms have been captured from the Ethiopians, who have been supplied by the Soviet Union. It is estimated that in the last 10 or 12 years the Soviet Union has provided $4 billion to $5 billion worth of arms to Ethiopia, and large amounts of those armaments have been either destroyed in the fighting or captured. The EPLF does not rely on arms from any source other than what it captures, and it has certainly captured an enormous amount. Everywhere one goes in Eritrea one sees people carrying AK47s and Kalashnikov machine guns, all captured from the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The EPLF soldiers and commanders have all learned their tactics on the job. None of them has been trained overseas, yet they are successfully conducting a conventional war. So successful is it that one of the great problems is that they now have over 12,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war in their charge. The Ethiopians refuse to have any discussions with them about repatriation because Mengistu describes the EPLF and the Eritreans as nothing but a bunch of bandits up in the hills. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity of inspecting a number of prisoner of war camps and walked freely amongst the Ethiopian prisoners. One of the most disturbing aspects about those prisoners of war is that most of them are conscripts and most of them are very young. We spoke to one prisoner who was only 15 years of age. At the age of 14 years, 12 months ago, he was attending high school in a southern province of Ethiopia when the Ethiopian Army arrived, surrounded the school with guns and trucks, and forcibly conscripted every boy 14 years of age and older straight into the Army. A number of these boys had only the most rudimentary training when they were put into action. The Eritreans said that some of those boys were so young that when the fighting started they cried for their mothers. They were terrified of the fighting in which they suddenly found themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Eritreans, though at considerable cost to themselves, ensure that they obey all the conventions of the Geneva Accord about the treatment of prisoners, despite the fact that the International Red Cross is very reluctant to have any discussion with the Eritreans about repatriation or the treatment of the prisoners because they recognise the Ethiopian Government, which does not recognise that there is a state of war. In my view the fact that the Eritreans are given little support is a very sad commentary. They would like to repatriate all these prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, I was the first non-Eritrean to interview three Soviet prisoners of war who were captured in the battle of Afabet earlier this year. There were two colonels and a lieutenant who were military advisers to the Ethiopian Army. They were captured suddenly when the Eritreans had a successful operation to capture the town of Afabet. I spoke to the Soviet Embassy here on my return and gave the names of the two colonels and the lieutenant. For the record, they are Colonel Ivigne Cherivov, Colonel Yuri Kalestraton and Lieutenant Alexander Colvadir. In interviewing them I told them that I would attempt via the Soviet Embassy to pass a message back to the Soviet Union to let their families know that although they are prisoners of war they are in good health and being well looked after. I can certainly testify to that, and Thursday night's Channel 10 program that I mentioned earlier will show some film which demonstrates that they are in good health. The Eritreans do not want to keep them. They are quite willing to repatriate them to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union refuses to negotiate directly with the EPLF because that would create diplomatic difficulties, I presume, with the Mengistu regime in Addis Ababa. So, unless that impasse is broken, these three prisoners face a long period of being held in Eritrea. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most disturbing features of the war-as I say, it is a conventional war-concerns the one area where the Ethiopians have superiority. They have a military air force, with many Mig fighter planes and light bomber planes supplied by the Soviet Union. These planes are used quite regularly to bomb not only the front line area where the battle is going on, but also Eritrean-controlled towns and farming areas, to try to destroy the food production capacity of the Eritreans. I visited the towns of Nacfa, which has been completely demolished by the bombing, and Afabet, which has been partly demolished by the bombing. While I was in the main street of Afabet I was able to inspect the wreckage of a shop which on 14 May was indiscriminately bombed by the Ethiopians. A bomb hit the shop and killed a woman and two children. They were civilians who had nothing to do with the war effort-and that is part of the tactics. While I was inspecting the wreckage I was able to collect a fragment of the bomb which killed these people. I seek leave to have this fragment of a Soviet-made 150-kilo bomb tabled in the Senate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I realise it is not the normal thing to table but, if any member of the Senate wishes to have a look at it, it is available. I have brought back an extra fragment and at some suitable time I wish to make a presentation of it to the Soviet Ambassador to give him an example of some of the consequences of the Soviet policy in Ethiopia and Eritrea. As I mentioned, the bombing is used as a tactic of Ethiopian war policy, and one sees the consequences of this in a number of refugee camps. I visited a refugee camp of displaced persons at Filfil just outside Nacfa. It is a very rudimentary camp in a river valley where the people are living in very simple brush-made and stone-made huts. They are adequately supplied with food by the Eritrean Relief Association. Australian food aid has been donated by the Australian Government and delivered by non-government organisations (NGOs).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I was at that refugee camp I interviewed a woman called Amna Mohammed, 31 years of age, who came from a village called Sheb near Asmara. Her horrifying account of what happened to her only six months ago gives an idea of the extent of the cruelty of this war. She was in her village whilst her husband was in the hills with the goat herd. They are traditional peasants. Suddenly the Ethiopian army arrived in the village with tanks which immediately started running through the huts of the village, machine gunning people. Some accounts say that up to 400 people were massacred in a period of an hour or so. She lost a four-year-old son in the shooting. She and her two other children only survived because they lay on the ground with other children and pretended to be dead. At one stage two Ethiopian soldiers came near them and her two-year-old child started to cry. She was about to make that dreadful choice of whether she should stand up and protect the child. I suppose it is equivalent to that famous movie and book Sophie's Choice when one has to make a choice of sacrificing oneself or sacrificing a child. Fortunately, she was not forced into that situation because she heard one the Ethiopian soldiers say, `Don't waste a bullet on the baby. It will die of thirst anyway'. So the Ethiopian soldiers left. After they left, towards evening she, with her two remaining children and five other children whose parents had been massacred, with a container of a gallon of water, walked for two days and two nights to the EPLF controlled areas. I should also point out that she was seven months pregnant at the time. I suppose that in a world which is a bit inured to horror and cruelty the account of this woman is still particularly moving. Without doubt she appears to be one of the most courageous people I have ever met. I wanted to place her case in Hansard so that people can see the consequences of this war. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned Australian aid has been very well used in Eritrea. The Australian Government, through NGOs, has given aid to the Ethiopians and the Eritreans on a humanitarian basis to overcome the problems of famine. The fact is that with the large number of people displaced from their normal agricultural production there is not enough food being produced. Everywhere one goes in Eritrea, when one says that one is an Australian no matter whether they are the most limited educated peasants or whether they are part of the leadership of the EPLF, there is genuine regard for Australia in that we made the effort for a country which is far away from Australia to provide aid to keep people alive. I would like to pay compliments to a number of NGOs who have made their own efforts and to people like Dr Fred Hollows from Sydney. He is an expert in ophthalmology. He went to Eritrea for some two months. He passed on his experience to a number of Eritrean doctors about how to overcome the problems of blindness, particularly the problem of trachoma which is prevalent amongst some of the people of Eritrea. I think Australians can be proud that their aid has been so well used. The Eritrean Relief Association, from my observations-and I am not an expert on this-runs an extremely efficient system for the distribution of aid. There is no hint of corruption or of aid being lost or wasted. It is actually given and distributed to the people on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA> People have often mentioned that Africa gets afflicted with some of the famous biblical plagues. I had the opportunity to see the impact of a major locust plague at a place called Nacfa. I grew up on a farm in Australia and have seen a few grasshopper plagues in my time, but I have never seen anything as amazing as this locust plague. The locusts are about as big as a budgerigar or a canary. They came swarming over the hill like a dark brown cloud and when they were over the town they shaded the sun from the ground. Fortunately the wind was blowing and they blew past the farming areas of the town. But it was a chilling sight to see this extraordinary large swarm of locusts which is just one of many in north Africa. It is disappointing to note that the Ethiopians have refused to cooperate with a spraying program and have threatened to shoot down any plane that tries to spray the locust plague. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other things I could mention about the efforts of the Eritrean people including their fantastic road building program, their health services, their education services and the underground factories which make shoes and sanitary napkins for women. This underground work is done at night but time does not allow me to continue on this subject as I do not want to delay the Senate too much. I have to admit that after visiting Eritrea I am biased. I am willing to support the Eritrean cause to get a political settlement. I think they have a just cause and I would only hope that the changes in Soviet foreign policy will lead to its putting pressure on Mengistu to reach a negotiated political settlement so that the killing and the war which is an enormous drain on both sides can stop. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year I have had the opportunity not only to visit Eritrea but also, as I have reported previously to the Senate, to visit Kampuchea. These are two experiences which have made a great mark on me. In Kampuchea I saw the results of a revolution which turned in on itself and created one of the worst genocides in human history. It is an example of revolution that no one could support. In Eritrea I believe I saw a different example of a revolution. It is not just a revolution in the war sense but it is a revolution of the mind. I believe that is why there is much to commend it. It is why people like me, who have visited, can openly express support for the Eritrean people. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in Eritrea we travelled most of the time by night because during the day there was a risk of getting bombed by Ethiopian Mig jets. Most of the time we travelled over rough roads for several hours. The week we were there was the time of the full moon. In the magnificent scenery of the Eritrean hills at midnight we experienced the most magnificent brilliant moonlight, the like of which I have never seen in Australia. I saw a society at work in this moonlight. I would suggest that one could call it the moonlight revolution. My thoughts will always be with the Eritreans. I suspect that whenever I see a full moon in Australia it will remind me that far away in the hills and valleys of Eritrea an amazing revolution is going on. My thoughts will go to the many Eritreans I have met. They were wonderful people who were dignified and committed to their cause. There are many of them whom I met and whom I would like to list but that would be far too many in the time available. I hope some day-as I said to them-to return to Eritrea, maybe in the not too distant future, and see the EPLF victory parade through Asmara when they achieve the independence that they so rightly deserve. I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to speak and put these remarks on the record. </PARA>
