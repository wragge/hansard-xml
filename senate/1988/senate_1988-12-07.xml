<TITLE>Preservation of the Environment</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20,000 years old archaeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed, like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway. Constitutional protection for historical and environmental assets is needed.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to hold a referendum to amend the constitution so that the Federal Government has the bounded constitutional duty, which any citizen may legally require it to perform and a right superior to state and local governments, to set above the commercial advantage of one generation, protect and restore all we hold in trust for the future-including relics, sites, features, areas, wildlife, buildings or things of Aboriginal and other historical, cultural architectural, scientific, aesthetic, ecological or environmental importance and-to care for the maintenance of the balance of nature, manage land, marine and atmospheric use so as to avoid their degradation and act nationally and internationally in any matter seen as related to these including-to prevent military and commercial use of uranium and derivatives, beach and related mining; to preserve Heritage Areas, The Great Barrier Reef Region at least as originally defined in the 1975 Act and extended into Torres Strait.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain Citizens of Australia showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> There are 160 signatures on the enclosed petition against the compulsory use of Tax-File Numbers.</PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of the upgraded Tax-File Number proposal would allow an increase of databanks and surveillance methods, and thus would be an intrusion on the traditional rights that have been enjoyed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other parallel threats to our privacy and liberties, such as the move to give Police in Australia and overseas access to Australian income tax records, and to give computer access to those records through a bureau in Brussels, and the move to give State police power to listen to private telephone conversation.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners humbly pray that the Parliament receive the 160 signatures on the enclosed petition, which prays for opposition to any Bill, or repeal of any Act, to establish the Tax-File Number proposal or any such moves, as being contrary to our personal liberties, our privacy, and the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to address an issue which has become of increasing concern to many Australians-the exposure to and manipulation of children by violent television programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is based on three undeniable facts. First, that children are very susceptible to the influence of television images and the behaviour such images promote. Secondly, this susceptibility is manipulated and exploited in the market place, and thirdly, and most importantly, these images and their associated toys are becoming more prevalent and more violent in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> It has reached the stage where many programs are merely ``program length commercials'' for various products. These have become a cynical force, or should I say farce, in children's television. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that this legislature stopped the tidal wave of television programs aimed at the nation's children; which are violent shows promoting violent toys. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now briefly outline to the Senate the extent of infiltration of such programs and their toys. </PARA>
<PARA> Children's cartoon programs that have been shown, or are showing on Australian TV screens are:</PARA>
<PARA> He Man and Masters of the Universe, currently showing each weekday morning on Channel 7's Earlybird program. `He Man' averages 21 acts of violence per hour.</PARA>
<PARA> Galvotron, with an average of 70 acts of violence per hour, has a hugely successful line of toys, known as Transformers usually in the form of a robot that the child can manipulate into a tank or spaceship. </PARA>
<PARA> Voltron, which until recently was showing at 7 a.m. every weekday morning on Channel 2. Probably the repeat rights expired because the ABC has replaced it with another program based on the same sort of combative model, that is, Battle of the Planets. </PARA>
<PARA> Robotech, with 70 acts of violence per hour, currently shows on Channel 9 at 8 a.m. on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> Centurions, with 84 acts of violence per hour, was showing on Channel 10 in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> M.A.S.K. (Mobile Armoured Strike Force), with 70 acts of violence per hour, was showing on Channel 9 last year. MASK toys by Toltoy were the top selling boys' toy in Australia in 1986, with almost half a million pieces sold in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Bravestarr, shows at 6 a.m. on Saturday on Channel 9. Its associated action doll, looking like a combined cowboy-spaceman actually hit toy shelves here before its television series arrived. </PARA>
<PARA> Pac-Man, shows on Channel 7 at 6.30 a.m. on Saturday. There are Pac-Man video games. </PARA>
<PARA> Captain Power and Soldiers of the Future (with an incredible 130 acts of violence per hour), was shown three times on Channel 9 recently but then withdrawn. The associated toys by Mattel are ``TV interactive'' computerised fighter planes that children fire at the screen to kill their cartoon enemies. The TV emits coded signals which are detected by these toys, which register when children hit a target. The hand-held toys may also be zapped by signals from the screen, in which case, the little fighter pilots actually eject from their planes but being ``goodies'' of course they are invulnerable, and can soon be reinstalled so that the game can go on. There must be a better application of this brilliant technology than that!</PARA>
<PARA> The list of these program length commercials goes on-there's She Ra: Princess of Power (sister of He-Man, she matches some of his exploits; Thundercats, Gobots, Dragon Force Ninja, Inhumanoids (with 87 acts of violence per hour and associated toys by Hasbro), Silverhawks, Action Force and more. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill inserts a new provision, s.118A, in the Broadcast Act 1942 to prohibit the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or a television broadcasting licensee from broadcasting a program that</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is designed for children; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) depicts acts of violence</PARA>
<PARA>if the Corporation or the licensee as the case may be, is aware that toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories depicted in the program, being toys designed on a theme of violence or war, are available for purchase in Australia.''</PARA>
<PARA> At present s.118 of the Act prohibits the Corporation or a licensee from broadcasting certain objectionable items, specifically ``matter which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene''. It also prohibits a person from rendering for broadcast, or passing or selecting for broadcast, an item, which contains matter which is ``blasphemous, indecent or obscene''. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that offences against the existing s.118 may be prosecuted only with the written consent of the Minister for Transport and Communications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill however, imposes no such limitations in relation to prosecutions under the proposed s.118A. It therefore retains the right of members of the public to initiate a private prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several reasons why the Bill seeks to prohibit these programs by inserting a new provision in the Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it is the only real option available to me as under the Broadcasting Act it is the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which has the function of determining program standards and it is appropriate that it has this role. However I believe it is also entirely appropriate that such an important concern as violence on children's programs be expressed specifically in the Act itself. It should be alongside the other ``objectionable'' matters which are deemed sufficiently important to be in the existing s.118 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal could expand its existing Children's Television Standards to incorporate and elaborate on the operation of s.118A. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is important to note that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and SBS are not expressly bound to comply with the program standards determined by the Tribunal. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act does however, direct the ABC to take account of the standards from time to time approved by the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore it is important to have this prohibition in the Act itself, expressly applying to the ABC (as does the existing s.118) as well as licensees. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason why the proposed amendment is appropriate is that it fits in with one of the main underlying philosophies of the Broadcasting Act which is to enable the public and the Tribunal to work together to determine what is permissible in our children's television programs. </PARA>
<PARA> More specifically, it would potentially enable the public to participate in a review of a licence by the Tribunal if the proposed s.118A was contravened. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanisms of the Act would work in the following way: the prohibition in the proposed s.118A (as with all the other provisions in the Act) would be incorporated as a condition of a television licence. Where the Tribunal is satisfied that a condition of the licence has not been complied with it must refuse to renew the licence it may also suspend or revoke the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> Public participation is facilitated because the Act empowers any person to make an application to the Tribunal requesting the Tribunal to exercise any of its substantive powers, one of which is the power to suspend or revoke a licence. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the Tribunal receives such an application (or proposes to investigate a breach on its own initiative) the Tribunal must hold an inquiry. Such inquiries are generally required to be held in public. </PARA>
<PARA> Submissions may be made to a public inquiry by any concerned person. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, placing the amendment in the Act itself means that where a licensee or the ABC contravenes s.118A they would be subject to the pecuniary penalties set out in s.132 of the Act ranging from $2,000-$10,000 for a body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall then, there are four main sanctions for a breach of the proposed s.118A by a licensee: prosecution either by a member of the public or the Director of Public Prosecutions; refusal to renew a licence by the Tribunal; possible suspension or revocation of a licence by the Tribunal; and a fine under s.132. In practice it is the Tribunal's power to review licences which is the most effective sanction against licensees who transgress. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC is not subject to the licensing provision of the Act and where it contravenes s.118A it is subject to a fine under s.132. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly the philosophy of this Bill is quite in keeping with the existing Children's Television Standards determined by the Tribunal. But the Bill specifically addresses a phenomena which has developed fairly recently and tightens up the controls on such cartoons. </PARA>
<PARA> Children's Television Standard 12 prohibits the broadcasting of programs which:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) demean any group of class of people on the basis of their sex, age, race, ethnicity, disability, religious beliefs or political convictions; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) present images or events in a way which is unduly frightening or unduly disturbing to children. </PARA>
<PARA>It is confusing, to say the least, why many of the programs I refer to are assessed as complying with Standard 12. Many questions could be raised concerning whether war cartoons do demean people on the basis of their sex-as most cartoons are based on ``macho'' action men and contain no positive or worthwhile view of females; and on the basis of race and ethnicity-as they encourage the view that killing and ``zapping'' the enemy i.e. those who are different, is an appropriate form of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise it could be argued that many of these cartoons are frightening and disturbing to children. Both in the short term where research has shown that children may become more aggressive and agitated while watching such programs; and in the long term, where the seeds of such disturbance have been planted but may manifest themselves later through violent teenage and adult life. I will refer shortly to the large body of research which shows such consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for the purposes of supporting this Bill I want to focus on Children's Television Standard 11 which recognises the particular susceptibility of children to products and prizes associated with a program. Among other things it restricts the presenter from recommending or endorsing a product or service which is presented as a prize, or encouraging children to buy it. Pre-school Standards 8 and 9 are in similar terms. These standards recognise that children regard the images on the television as authoritative or at least as desirable role models and are therefore susceptible to manipulation in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes a step further and makes it clear that programs which encourage, endorse or are based on certain violent war toys associated with the programs should be prohibited and it inserts the prohibition in the Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to learn from the United States experience where such programs are allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation of American children's television programs was started in force in 1982 by Mark Fowler, then Commissioner of the F.C.C. (Federal Communications Commission, which is the U.S. Government's television control board). Since then, a glut of toy based cartoons has been developed, emanating to many countries including Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Such program length commercials had been banned by the F.C.C. in 1969 because research had shown that children were unable to distinguish between programming and advertising. The ruling was also due to the rights of children to have programming made for them-and not merely as a means to profit through sales of related toys. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the discarding of these restrictions in '82, (at the request of powerful toy manufacturer, Mattel) 80 per cent of all children's programming in the U.S. has consisted of programs funded by toy companies to sell their various lines of toys, many of which promote adversarial, war-based play by children. In fact, between 1982 and 1986, the sales of war toys increased by 600 to 700 per cent in the U.S. Starting off with `He Man' which first aired in 1983, there have been at least 40 war cartoon series. </PARA>
<PARA> We must see children's television programs which are violent and their war toys as one total package. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry's response to the plethora of research linking violence in children's television programs with aggressive, antisocial or disturbed behaviour in children, has been devastatingly irresponsible and unfortunately parents seem to be unable to resist the temptation of using TV as a built-in baby-sitter. Research by the TV industry itself shows that most children select their own programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent Victorian Committee of Inquiry on Anti-Social Toys called for the banning of toys of violence (i.e. toys designed to inflict real or imagined harm such as Transformers) and war toys, (which include toys, war games, model kits or soldiers and scenes or war). Examining psychological studies on the impact of such toys brought the Committee to this conclusion. 12 out of 13 studies on toy guns and war toys reported harmful effects on normal children from playing with violent toys when compared with non-violent toys. </PARA>
<PARA> Via the toys that adults buy for children, they transmit certain values-war toys embody attitudes that are pro-militarism, pro-racism and pro-sexism. These toys become props for children to imitate the violent themes of their related TV cartoon shows. This connection becomes even more insidious when we realise that these war toys are actually designed first, and then the animated cartoons are created afterwards in order to entice child viewers into the toy stores. Children who have swallowed the marketing pitch of the cartoon shows and/or have been influenced by peers, often wield remarkable consumerist power over their parents these days. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined might of these violent, futuristic children's TV shows and associated lines of war toys, is encouraging children to come to some worrying and antisocial conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> - that the way to successfully solve problems and conflicts is to apply violence with all speed;</PARA>
<PARA> - that heroes are invincible, have no sense of fear and always shoot faster and hit harder than their adversaries;</PARA>
<PARA> - that being a hero depends on physical power and strength of weaponry-and for a man, on getting his own way;</PARA>
<PARA> - that enemies have no redeeming features being totally evil and unworthy and therefore subjects to be killed;</PARA>
<PARA> - that violence itself is entertaining;</PARA>
<PARA> - that it is appropriate that so much human ingenuity should be expended on more new and spectacular ways to kill and destroy. </PARA>
<PARA> As children's violent cartoons concentrate on perpetual exciting action and high points of violent confrontation, extremely little attention is paid to either the causes or consequences of such violent actions. This is neither a healthy nor realistic understanding for children to develop about violence. </PARA>
<PARA> Murray and Lonnborg, in an article published in 1986 in Media Information Australia, wrote ``Most psychologists who have ever conducted research in the area . . . are convinced by the accumulated evidence from hundreds of research projects that indicate a relationship between TV violence and children's aggressive behaviour (Murray, J. and Lonnborg-Article in Media Information (1986). </PARA>
<PARA> Frost (1986) stated that research shows that viewing cartoon, violence increases children's aggression and playground violence, their verbal hostility, anger levels and intensity of violent responses. Further, it reduces sharing behaviour and imaginative play, decreases enthusiasm for school, produces and increases anxiety, maintains long term aggression, and produces false understandings of social realities. He also refers to numerous studies which document harmful effects of playing with war toys, so many of which are now promoted by violent cartoons (Frost, Joe Influences of Television on Children's Behaviour. Paper presented at the international Association for the Child's right to play Seminar. (Birmingham, August 26, 1986). </PARA>
<PARA> Sprafkin, Gadow and Grayson (1987) found that children with low IQs became increasingly more physically aggressive following aggressive cartoons as compared with controls (Sprafkin, J. Gadow, I.C. and Grayson, P.-Effects of Viewing Aggressive cartoons on the behaviour of learning disabled children. Jnl of child psychology and psychiatry and allied disciplines. May 87 Vo1 28 (3). </PARA>
<PARA> The report by the New Zealand Ministerial Committee of Inquiry into Violence (March, 1987) stated the following: ``In our opinion, analysis of television content shows that television certainly does not portray violence as it actually occurs in real life. It grossly distorts and exaggerates this aspect of life, and by these distortions, offers harmful models to its young viewers.'' Also, ``The Commission concluded that there was enough established knowledge of public concern about long term cumulative effects of viewing high levels of violence to warrant action to reduce the amount of it shown on television.'' (Report of Ministerial Committee of Inquiry into Violence (NZ) March 1987, 131-133</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Di Bretherton a Melbourne psychologist was quoted in the October 1988 issue of Habitat: ``Today the average boy spends 4 hours with the television superheroes per day, and 3 minutes interacting with his father'' (Bretherton, D.-War Toys, would you buy one? Habitat October, 1988. This is a very sad reflection on present parenting practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those psychologists I have just quoted, make a plea to parents not to use the TV sets as an unmonitored baby-sitter-but rather to intervene in their children's viewing habits. Some parents are conscientious in this regard-but many are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Liebert (1986) stated that ``research has shown that heavy doses of TV violence viewing are associated with the development of aggressive attitudes and behaviour'' . . . and further, that ``TV viewing also appears to cultivate stereotypic views of gender roles and race'' . . . and that ``commercials often capitalise on children's naivete and also can foster and reinforce overly materialistic attitudes.''

<PARA> Huesmann (1986) presents a developmental theory to account for the link between increased exposure to media violence and increased aggressive behaviour. It is argued that the effect of media violence on individual differences in aggression is primarily the result of a cumulative learning process during childhood (Huesmann, L. R.-Psychological processes promoting the relation between exposure to media violence and aggressive behaviour by the viewer. Jnl of Social Issues. 1986; Vol 42 (3) 125-139. It is contended that if undampened, this process can build enduring schemes for aggressive behaviour that persist into adulthood. In a paper published in 1987, Huesmann with co-researcher Eron maintained that heavy exposure to TV violence is one of the causes of aggressive behaviour, crime and violence in society (Eron, L. and Huesmann, L.-Television as a source of maltreatment of children-Social Psychology Review 1987 Vol 16 (2)195-202). </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to do justice to the huge amount of research in psychology which has been done both in Australia and overseas showing the damaging effects of such programs but the major findings are consistent and universal. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot ignore the dire message of all this data. </PARA>
<PARA> We can, however, make some changes in our social environment to avoid the actual encouragement of the more antisocial expression of this aggression. Further than that, we can encourage the development of more pro-social attitudes in developing children. </PARA>
<PARA> What action can we take to ensure that children have a more positive, wholesome menu available to them in both their all-pervasive televised media environment and in their play environment? For their own sakes as individuals, and for the sake of our society, we have to tackle this question in an energetic and practical fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to be congratulated for the setting up in August of this year an inquiry to be conducted by the Tribunal into the ``portrayal, presentation and reporting of violence on television''. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry is to include general entertainment, current affairs and news programs and, very importantly, cartoons. The Tribunal is directed to have regard to the concern in the Australian community an erosion of human sensibilities and respect for life and also to have regard to the ``particular susceptibility of children''. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the inquiry is to look into the adequacy of existing powers under the Broadcasting Act and report on the best way to regulate violence on television, the inquiry is not due to report until 31 August 1989. Thus it may take up to two years before such ``violent cartoons'' are properly regulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, it may be a long time before a review currently being conducted by the Tribunal into the Children's and Pre-school Children's Television Standards results in actual changes to those Standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern about violence in the community has also seen the establishment of a National Committee on Violence, a joint Commonwealth/State initiative recommended by the 1987 summit on gun control and violence. However we must not focus merely on ``Rambo'' movies and their effect on their eighteen year old audience. We must also focus on the ``Rambos'' of the 5-14 year olds-the ``He Men'', the Galvatrons and the Robotechs. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are really serious about stemming the rising incidence of violence in the community we must look at what is being fed to our children on television screens. </PARA>
<PARA> At the community level there is very strong evidence of public concern over violent cartoons and associated aggressive toys. Two of Australia's largest retailers must be congratulated on their recent decisions regarding war toys. Myers banned the selling or buying of toy guns in August of this year and banned certain ``antisocial'' toys in 1987, Australia wide. David Jones decided in February 1988 not to restock toy guns in their Melbourne stores with toy guns being unavailable from about September 1988 as a result. ``Victim'' toys have been banned Australia wide. </PARA>
<PARA> Many general community groups are working to stop the trading in war toys and their insidious connection with children's Television Programs, and new groups have been established with this specific aim such as the National Coalition Against war and Violent Toys established in September 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Parliament reflects this community concern about negative and aggressive attitudes and behaviour being encouraged in our children by television programs designed specially for them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are concerned about the physical, mental and spiritual well being of the nation's children, we should at least prohibit the broadcasting of violent programs for children with which toys are associated. Therefore, I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when we were discussing the estimated extra revenue of $300m, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) referred us to his speech explaining the make-up of that figure. We have since examined the Hansard in detail and the explanation is quite unsatisfactory. This chamber could well be passing this gold tax legislation on a false and misleading premise based on what I might term incomplete arithmetic by this Government. This Government and this Minister boast of economic rationality. The calculation that I believe has been the basis for this figure is incomplete and does not rest on this premise about which he is undoubtedly proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has misled the chamber because page 4 of the explanatory memorandum would lead all reasonable people to believe that the figure of $300m stated thereon is a net figure. In fact, it appears from the Minister's explanation and from the explanation given by Senator Cook that in effect it is the primary tax payable by companies. How misleading! In effect, we could well find that the Government is losing money as a result of this particular transaction. This is a quite deliberate attempt by the Government to mislead the people of Australia about the true extent of the so-called tax savings of this amount. What is the point of having a financial impact statement to accompany a Bill if it is not honest, so deficient, and does now show the true effect? A company's profitability is not determined by its gross turnover; it is determined by its net profit after tax. Will the Minister come clean and explain the basis of the calculations. I ask the Minister to table before this chamber his calculations as to how this $300m has been determined. Will he do that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech when this Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. If the Minister looks at that speech he will see the figure of $870m. It is definitely in that speech, unless I got a peculiar copy. The figure of $300m was bandied around by Senator Cook. He was the first person to mention that it was a gross figure. Senator Cook then attempted to calculate the profit by taking the difference between the cost of recovering gold, which he said was $300 an ounce-I believe it is only $260-compared with the world price of $560. When I was trying to do my own calculations I was not able to find out total production in Australia for the last financial year because I could not get the figures from Treasury; I could only get the export figures. I was given no valid reason why I could not have those figures. I was told that they were confidential. I would certainly like to know why those figures were confidential; there may be some reason for it. But I was unable to do my own calculations because the figures were not given to us. As Senator Watson has said, a lot of explanation is needed. We are debating a Bill that will supposedly raise $300m in one financial year, but no justification is given for that figure. There is doubt as to whether a paper showing how that figure of $300m is arrived at exists. I do not believe that it exists but, if it does, we would like to see it as soon as possible,</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of questions that arise out of the matters that were discussed in this place last night that we would like to pursue with the Minister for Finance. I strongly support what Senator Watson has said on this matter, that the Government should incorporate in the record a statement which shows that it will gain $300m, as it claims it will, from the gold tax. During the debate last night we produced evidence from reports of J. B. Were and Son and Ernst and Whinney, chartered accountants, which demonstrated that there would be a net loss of revenue to the Commonwealth as a result of the introduction of the gold tax. First, I reiterate the arguments that were put by Ernst and Whinney so that point is clear. Ernst and Whinney made a study of the tax that is estimated to be raised by the Government during the implementation of this new tax, based on corporate tax applying to goldmining companies. It also took into account any tax on dividends that might be payable by those companies to shareholders. It took into account stamp duties that would arise in relation to State revenues, share transfers, and so on. It also took into account capital gains tax that would be payable in the light of continuing rises in the value on the stock exchange of shares in goldmining companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly what is happening in the industry at present is an unprecedented period of expansion. That investment and expansion means that profits will be made by those shareholders who are trading in shares in goldmining companies, that will yield to the Government capital gains tax. As Ernst and Whinney estimated, during the March to June quarter this year that yield will be some $200m. Having made it clear that we are asserting that the Government may not have taken into account the capital gains tax yield from share trading in goldmining companies and may not have taken into account other factors, we assert that its calculation of some $300m being yielded to the Treasury as a result of the introduction of the new tax may not be correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the debate last night Senator Walsh sought to change the focus of the argument somewhat. We were talking about what is a gross and net revenue yield from the goldmining industry. First and foremost Senator Cook intervened and there was some kerfuffle as to whether we were talking about gross or net revenue. I think Senator Walsh estimated in the end that the $300m that he estimates is, in fact, a net figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Minister has spelt out into the Hansard that he is taking into account the carry forward of exploration expenditures prior to the year 1991. He later referred to the question of dividends and said that there had been no revenue taken into account from dividends payable to shareholders. I think he based his argument on the question of the imputation system and said that that virtually is swallowed up in the corporation tax. I will leave that argument aside for the moment. I will come back to it later. The point is that the Minister has argued on the basis of a totally different point from the one we asserted during the debate. We were saying that there were other yields, such as from capital gains, share trading, et cetera, which have nothing to do with the counter argument the Minister was seeking to make last night. That is why we in the Liberal and National parties want a detailed paper from the Minister on how the Government arrived at its calculation of $300m. We believe that the attempt by the Minister and Senator Cook last night in this place to explain the Government's calculations was totally unreliable, misleading and probably fallacious. We will need to see a detailed statement from the Minister before we are prepared to allow the passage of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is perfectly appropriate for this chamber to ask for these sorts of figures. The Government is in a position to add any figure by way of revenue raised to any legislation that it chooses, presumably applying some additional pressure to people who believe that all revenue raising measures should be passed in this place without question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government provides us with these figures one of two things will happen. Either the Government's estimate of $300m to be raised in a full year will be an overestimate, or it will be an underestimate. If the figure is a significant overestimate of the revenue to be raised it will be a clear indication that the devastation which the gold industry says will occur to it will not happen. If it is an underestimate of the amount of money to be raised, it will be a clear indication of the fact that the industry should have been required to pay this tax much earlier because it obviously has been depriving Consolidated Revenue of vast amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard all sorts of hysteria in this place when the fringe benefits tax was introduced. We were told that restaurants around Australia would close down in their hundreds and that unemployment would run rife. That did not happen. Indeed, there was an underestimation in the case of the fringe benefits tax, as there was with the capital gains tax, of the amount of revenue to be raised. So as far as I am concerned the Government can table the information. It can tell us what the figuring was in Treasury or elsewhere that made it assess the likely revenue to be raised in a full year as $300m. If it cannot do that, we need to ask some fairly serious questions about the competency of officials who produce these sorts of figures out of the air. This is quite separate from the question of whether there ought to be a tax on goldmining companies. It is a question of whether governments are trying to apply pressure of one sort or another to an assortment of people, trying to con the public. The figures need to be provided to this place, and the sooner the better. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand that the Government is concerned that this debate is dragging on while we await those figures, but it should have had those figures to hand. If we finish up talking on the tax laws for the rest of this week and the road funding and the social security funding legislation do not get through, that is one of the things that happen in this place. Somebody has to wear it or we will come back for another week. The figures can be provided and they should be provided. I guess that we will sit here until they are provided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 is the legislation that contains the 20 per cent cut to company tax rates. As I indicated at the second reading stage, the Australian Democrats believe that the Government's priorities are somewhat awry if it believes that company tax should be dropped from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar at a time when many companies in this country are paying less than 1c in the dollar in tax while pensioners and low income earners, of course, are paying considerably more than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We signalled at the second reading stage that we would be moving an amendment that would delay the implementation of company tax cuts until such time as the promised personal tax cuts came into effect at a similar percentage rate. I do not think that this is inappropriate. We have a position in this country where company tax is nominally 49c in the dollar; where the top 200 or so companies pay on average 28c in the dollar; where most of the major companies in this country are paying 10c or 11c in the dollar and are threatening to take their companies to other countries because they claim that this is an excessively high imposition on them; and where at least one major company-and I point out that it is a company involved in goldmining ventures here and overseas-will pay no tax at all next year and will be paying less than 1c in the dollar this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite inappropriate that we have that sort of situation existing when company tax is nominally set at 49c in the dollar and when the Government is still persisting with a plan to cut a further 20 per cent off that payment. Company tax would drop to a nominal 39c in the dollar, and presumably those companies which are paying 28c in the dollar will be paying around 20c in the dollar-and companies which are paying less than 1c in the dollar at the moment will start getting money back from the Government! One wonders where the Government's priorities are in all of this, at a time when ordinary pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers whose incomes hit $19,500 per year are expected to pay 40.25c in the dollar for every dollar earned above that amount. There is something very sadly wrong when that sort of situation applies in a country which is supposed to put a high regard on social justice and economic equity. There is nothing equitable about that sort of situation. The amendment which the Democrats have circulated to page 1, clause 2, of the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1988 would effectively hold up this cut in company tax until the Government had attended to the question of tax cuts for ordinary PAYE taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people in government and in business have argued that it is inappropriate to give ordinary PAYE taxpayers a tax cut too soon, because they go out and spend that money. This action overheats the economy, particularly since these people spend their money, to a very large extent, on imported goods. This affects our balance of trade and all sorts of other nasty things happen. I would point out that some of the biggest purchasers of the most expensive imported items are companies. Australia has never developed the heavy machinery industry in this country that would allow those companies to purchase Australian-made goods. It is beyond my understanding why we are now talking about cutting company tax and giving companies a free rein on purchasing imports. This will no doubt have exactly the same effect on our balance of trade figures as a pensioner family going out and buying its children a sweater which is made in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government was voted into office, apparently, by low income earners, although it was heavily supported by the big business community. Whether this is a payoff to the latter or not, I do not know. Certainly, the Government has abandoned any support in return to those low income families and traditional Labor supporters who put it into office in 1983, then in 1984, and again in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a problem in the economy and if tax cuts to PAYE wage and salary earners are going to be held off until the middle of next year, and may not be as high as was first anticipated, then it is quite inappropriate to be proceeding with a 20 per cent tax cut to companies when many companies in this country are paying nothing like 49c in the dollar and some of them are paying nothing at all. An amendment has been circulated in the name of the Australian Democrats and I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 1, clause 2, lines 8 to 10, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Commencement</PARA>
<PARA> ``2. (1) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA> `income tax' has the same meaning as in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;</PARA>
<PARA> `rates of income tax' are the rates of income tax specified in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 as in force when this Act commences. </PARA>
<PARA> ``2. (2) This Act commences on the commencement of provisions in an Act, howsoever that Act is described, which have the effect of reducing, by not less than the percentage by which the rate of tax payable by companies is reduced by this Act, the rates of income tax payable, on his or her own behalf, by an individual taxpayer who is a natural person.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that at least a majority of honourable senators will see some sense in introducing a little equity into this taxation system. In this way, the vast bulk of families for whom the Liberal Party, in particular, is constantly expressing concern, will not be put further behind the eight-ball whilst some of the biggest money earners in this country, in the way of companies, and some of the smallest taxpayers in this country-often the same companies-will be allowed a further 20 per cent bonanza. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the Opposition will not support the Australian Democrats' amendment. I must say, though, that it is very tempting to do so, in the light of the hypocrisy of the Government over its recent statements on tax rates. Quite clearly, we are not getting any clear indication from the Government about what it intends to do with tax rates during the current or the next financial year. Yet we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) parading about, claiming that tax rates are going to be reduced substantially for lower and middle income earners and others throughout the community. We have seen promises from Mr Keating at the time of the Budget this year. We have seen contradictory statements from the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who has said that we cannot afford it. We have a continual confusion within the Government over taxation rates and what the taxpayers of Australia might expect in the next financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I know is that the figures show that since 1985 the Government, through bracket creep and through inflation affecting the pay packets of ordinary individual Australian workers, has reefed off $7,000m extra which it could very well afford, in proper circumstances, to hand back to the taxpayers of Australia. That is something which we keep hearing promises about whenever there is an election in view, or a by-election, or whatever. But when it comes to the point of delivery, the Government fails to produce the results. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Democrats' amendment is obviously a political stunt on their part. Clearly, they are pushing the same old barrow that they have been pushing for some months now about taxation rates affecting companies. The issues are not the same. The Democrats have not sought, in the course of Senator Haines's remarks, to bring forward any estimates of the costs to the Commonwealth of the introduction of this measure. Nor have they sought to substantiate, except in the vaguest terms, the economic effects of such a policy. The Democrats are past masters at this kind of grandstanding and political stunting. Consequently, we will not be giving our support to what is a very ill-prepared presentation to the Senate and for what will substantially and potentially be one of the most significant economic events of the next several years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of the amendment has been clearly explained. There is no need to repeat it. The Government will not accept it. I make only a couple of points. The collection of company tax is effectively lagged by 12 months, so the actual payments by individuals and companies will be pretty well synchronised. On the question of revenue from the corporate sector, I do not have the papers in front of me but from memory-this is in nominal terms-there has been an increase of 150 per cent over the last five years in corporate tax payments, from around $4 billion five years ago to an estimated $10.2 billion this year. That is partly a function of the strong economic growth of the last five years and of the depressed level in 1982-83. It is also, however, very heavily attributable to the base broadening measures which the Government has introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear from the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that there has been an increase in corporate tax payments into Consolidated Revenue. That does not alter the fact that there are a number of companies-some very big profit-making companies and some very large companies-that are not paying any tax at all or are anticipating not paying any tax next year. While the rest of them might well be contributing more than they have in the past it is, as Senator Walsh points out, less to do with the size of the tax levels than due to improvements in the economy in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I found Senator Messner's argument somewhat puzzling. He started off by saying that the Opposition was tempted to support the amendment because of government hypocrisy and so on. He then turned around and told us that it was a political stunt. The best way to stop this being a political stunt is to support it. He does not seem to regard his amendments that will not get majority support, on any piece of legislation, as a political stunt. So I fail to see why something that should fit into Liberal Party philosophy, as expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, can be regarded as a political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the policy released by Mr Howard on behalf of the Liberal Party over the weekend was a commitment to ordinary Australian families, cute Australian families, bordered with a nice little oval frame with hints of nostalgia about times past. The hymn that went with the policy proclaimed a new life for Australian families, a better life for Australian families and a better standard of living for Australian families. One of the ways of achieving that is to improve their disposable income. If the Opposition does not want a wages blow-out, I would have thought that the next best way of improving disposable income capacities for ordinary individuals and ordinary Australian families was to reduce their tax burden. This tax burden, as we all agreed yesterday, is at least partially caused by bracket creep-not that this Government, I might add, is the first government to benefit through revenue raised courtesy of bracket creep. But there it is. We have the ridiculous situation of people earning less than average weekly earnings paying 40.25c in the dollar on every dollar earned above $19,500. We are saying to those people, `We are going to cut 20 per cent off company tax'-not that most companies are paying it anyway-`and companies will be paying at the top rate of 39c in the dollar while you poor mugs out there are working a 38-hour week to earn $19,500, and if you earn over that amount you will lose more per dollar in tax than companies are losing'. </PARA>

<PARA> I think it is quite extraordinary for the Opposition to say one weekend that it is deeply concerned about Australian families and then to indicate that it is not concerned enough about them to place a fairly heavy amount of pressure on this Government to introduce tax cuts for individuals, and hence for Australian families, at the same time, and in the same percentage magnitude, as it is introducing cuts for company taxes. This is not a political stunt. It is certainly not a political stunt of the sort that I noticed in the Australian's reporting of Mr Howard's remarks that the Opposition is going to repeal the tertiary tax if it ever gets into government. That tertiary tax has not passed the Parliament yet, and it can only do so with the support of the Opposition. Mr Howard is promising to repeal something, if the Opposition ever gets into government, that his own Party is going to be supporting next week. The Opposition talks about hypocrisy and political stunts-I think that takes the cake! All we are saying in this amendment is that, if companies deserve a 20 per cent cut in their tax payable, ordinary Australian families and individuals deserve the same cut and the two things should come into operation at the same time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not accepting the amendment. The effect of the amendment would be to exempt for that period of time from a higher rate of sales tax goods classified under item 92, if I remember correctly. That was inadvertently omitted from an earlier piece of legislation. The reason it was omitted was that the Australian Taxation Office had no record of any concession being claimed under that particular item. After the earlier legislation had been passed, I think an accountant was canvassing potential customers that they should use this item 92 loophole as a means of tax avoidance. To accept the amendment, even though the revenue effects of it would be very small, perhaps even zero, is to sanction the principle of accountants diligently searching around for loopholes that can be exploited to avoid the spirit of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government decided not to accept this amendment without having heard any argument about it, which does not surprise me; that is the normal way this Government proceeds. It is not accepting it basically, as we understand the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), on the grounds that the part it is now seeking to amend was inadvertently omitted because there had been no record of exemptions previously. I think in that case, if the Minister is to substantiate his proposition that this matter is not being dealt with solely-I stress the word `solely'-because some accountants were canvassing this loophole and that even though, and I quote the Minister, `the revenue effects are zero or very small' it would be a bad principle, as I understand the Minister--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They may be zero or very small; nobody knows. I think then it is up to the Minister to establish clearly that there were no companies which were caught inadvertently, accidentally, at no fault of their own, as a result of their normal business procedures. It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here and for the Commissioner of Taxation to put up to him changes that are retrospective, and clearly retrospective, on the grounds that someone may have cheated, that there may have been some impact-the Minister does not know; he stressed that just now when he said `Maybe; we don't know'-and that someone may have followed the advice of an accountant canvassing for business by pointing out loopholes. I think that it is absolutely vital for this Minister to show some knowledge of whether some decent, honest business people are being cheated by this Government in this way by retrospective legislation; and there is no denial here that it is retrospective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister says that it was inadvertently omitted from the law and that is why so quickly after that law has been changed the Government is changing it again-yet another mistake among the legion of mistakes that this Government has made with its tax legislation. It is almost inevitable that every bit of tax legislation that comes forward gets massively amended, just as it is inevitable, when every bit of tax legislation comes forward outlining what the revenue effects will be, that those calculations are basically, overwhelmingly and, monumentally wrong. It is that record of inaccuracy and incompetence, for example, that has prompted the Opposition to ask-supported by the Australian Democrats; and I think Senator Haines was quite right earlier this morning-how the Government works out the $300m on the gold tax. The Minister, with refreshing honesty, has said that he does not know what the revenue impact of this will be-he has no idea-but that it probably could be very small or zero. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines quite rightly asks whether I know what the revenue impact will be. I have no idea at all, because the Government has not told us; the Government does not know. All we know is that there are companies which claim to have been unfairly, improperly and retrospectively affected by this legislation. One packaging company has quite properly pointed out to us-the facts do not appear to be in dispute by the Minister-that the original Bill did not amend item 92 of the first schedule, that is, the exempt schedule, which exempts bags and sacks used for fertilisers or chaff or for marketing exempt goods. The Government amended every other provision in the sales tax legislation to provide that paper bags would no longer be exempt under the legislation. It was on this basis that the company which has contacted us, and which had previously been claiming exemption for its goods under item 92, thought that it was not subject to the sales tax changes announced in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, previous to the Budget announcement. The point is that this company, in its correspondence with us, says that it had previously been claiming exemption for its goods under item 92. Yet the Minister has come in here and told us that there is no record of exemptions previously made. Who is misleading whom? Is the Minister saying that the company is wrong? On past performance, it is clearly the Government that is once again wrong. But who would be surprised by that? It is interesting that whenever the Government is wrong it does not pay the bill; the private sector, the taxpayer, the ordinary person does. Whenever this Government makes a mess of something, whenever it makes a mistake, the taxpayer picks up the bill. That is one of the reasons why tax under this Government has grown faster than any other indicator in Australia. It has grown far faster than inflation, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a 147 per cent increase in sales tax collections since this Government came to power-more than double the rate of inflation. It is an extraordinary, incredible increase. If it is true, as the company says, that it had previously been claiming exemptions for its goods under item 92, it would have been quite realistic for it to think that it was not subject to the sales tax changes announced in the Budget. Let us remember this: those sales tax changes were announced in the Budget to operate from Budget time. As is usual, the legislation was to follow later. It is a fair bit later; we are into December. This is not nearly as long as most Government legislation seems to take to put tax changes into effect. We have had three years after the event, finding then that the legislation bears only a passing resemblance to the press statement on which it was allegedly based. For all that period people have had to operate in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation, this company believed that the alterations to the sales tax law that had been brought into effect clearly reflected the Government's intention. As a taxpayer one is entitled to assume competence on the part of the Government; maybe it is a risky assumption these days. When the Government announces something, some months later brings in legislation to bring it into effect, and a company finds that the part that affects it has specifically been exempted from amendment-item 92-surely it has a right to assume that it means the Government has taken the view that the item should be exempted from legislation and that the announcement made in the Budget therefore does not apply to it. That is what a reasonable person would assume. Consequently, this company has not been levying 20 per cent tax on its goods. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not go into the merits of whether wrapping for food and other items should be subject to a 20 per cent tax. This Government says that it does not believe in consumption tax. It believes only in secret, back-door taxes which are not part of a consumption tax or where there are no offsets. We heard this Government complaining bitterly about any suggestions of a consumption tax to offset a significant reduction in income tax. We heard its attitude to that a year or so ago. What the Government has done is far more dishonourable. It has hit us with enormous consumption taxes, with no reduction offsetting that in income taxes. It promised a reduction but, frankly, I can understand how nervous the Government must be about the prospect of introducing those income tax cuts. This probably explains the reason why the Government was so keen to cut short Mr Hayden's overseas visit. If it had continued at that rate of expenditure the Government certainly could not have afforded any income tax cuts next year. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Messner" NAMEID="9I4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Messner says, it also contributed horrendously to the overseas debt. That may be part of the reason the figures have been so bad. To that extent, I can understand the Government's enthusiasm to cut short Mr Hayden's overseas visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The companies in this area were legally entitled not to apply the 20 per cent tax on their goods. If the Government wants to amend item 92 to reflect its Budget announcement, then it should apply the amendment to the date of its introduction or announcement. Having introduced legislation which purported to cover the issue and to which people had responded in a proper commercial way, it cannot then say, `We did not do it properly. We inadvertently made a mistake'. This is what the Minister is effectively saying, `We inadvertently made a mistake but we don't cop the cost of our mistake; the taxpayer cops the cost of the mistake'. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely this is a reasonable proposition. No company could object to the tax applying to item 92 from the date of the introduction of the legislation. How on earth can this company now go back to try to collect from its customers a sales tax which it did not apply because it believed-quite properly, because it was not in the legislation-that it should not apply? Who will carry the cost of this? Surely this depends on whether the company, as it claims, had been claiming exemptions under item 92. If this is so, the Australian Taxation Office must have a record of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government, firstly, to check again whether there is any record of exemptions under item 92: secondly, even if prior to the Budget there were no records of exemptions under item 92, why does the Government believe it has the right, having made a mistake, to require companies which followed and obeyed the law and which did not collect the 20 per cent sales tax because the law specifically exempted them, retrospectively to change that law when in fact the law was clear and uncomplicated and it stated a particular position which the Government now says was inadvertent? There is no defence. The Government has made a mistake and the taxpayer will have to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh says there is a principle involved. There certainly is, and it is not the principle of creating some sort of precedent for when the Government makes a mistake. The principle is this: there should not be retrospective laws. Everyone, in taxation and other areas, should know what is legal at the time and people who abide by the law should not be subject to these sorts of penalties. The Government has no idea of the revenue effects. It says that at the most they will be very small. I do not know why the Government is fighting about this. It should simply say, `Look, we made a mistake; we goofed again. We again have amendments to tax legislation'. Surely the Government should stop this absolutely disgraceful behaviour. It has failed to recognise a basic principle; that is, that retrospective legislation, in tax as in anything else, is not the way to go. It is unprincipled-but that is appropriate to this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill is yet another example of the Government's `Let's get it right this time' method of running the country. It is a bit too often the case now that the Government overlooks things or does not draft legislation properly, or finds out it is not going to work the way it has been drafted. When we go back to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) we will find that three sections of that legislation will be withdrawn, and quite properly withdrawn, because they are simply unworkable. Again those provisions involve sales taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is claiming that it really meant to have something included in an earlier piece of legislation, and just made a mistake. That is not good enough. The Government made the mistake; it has to wear it. It can correct that mistake by amending the legislation so that an item is included from a specific date but it cannot turn around and correct its mistake by saying, `Whoops, we erred; now give us the money that you would have given us if only we had got it right in the first place'. I doubt whether any ordinary taxpayer in the country could get away with that argument, put to the Commissioner of Taxation as a result of a late tax payment. If some ordinary pay as you earn taxpayer owes the Government money and does not pay up on time and the tax people come around and say that a penalty applies, he cannot say, `Whoops, I thought I had actually done that; I guess I forgot to put it in the mail or forgot to sign the cheque, or got the amount wrong'. Those sorts of arguments do not wash, and neither should the reverse situation wash. The Government either gets its legislation right or it wears the consequences. In this case the consequence is a couple of months of smaller revenue than had been anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called minor amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act of 1935 introduced by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) in another place early in November will be quite costly for a number of firms involved in the production of these items. The amendments relate in particular to the classification of paper and plastic bags-pie bags, bread bags, flour bags and what have you. The Australian Taxation Office, as I said a minute ago, argued that it really intended to tax these bags from the date of the Budget, but whoever drafted the legislation made a mistake. Of course, the problem is that the mistake is being corrected not from the time that the amending legislation has come before us, or even the time that it is passed, but by the Bill being made to apply retrospectively from 23 August 1988. The simple fact of the matter is that the proposed changes were not announced until the first week in November, some 10 weeks after the date on which the legislation is now supposed to apply. In that 10-week period the companies involved will have sold millions of dollars worth of products which they are now being told are retrospectively taxable. When those goods were sold they were exempt, so the increased price that is accrued from the imposition of the sales tax that should have been in place but was not, because of the mistake made by the tax people, was not added to the customers' costs. There is no way that the companies can recoup that by getting in touch with the people who purchased the items and saying, `Look, we are sorry but the Tax Office has made a mistake and it is going to bash us around the ears retrospectively so can you please give us a bit more money?'. I presume there is no legal method by which those companies can do that, even assuming they could find every one of the people to whom they sold a package. </PARA>

This piece of the legislation will not be passed. It is very unfair when companies through no fault of their own are asked to bear the costs of a tax error by the Government which they cannot then recoup themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, I am reliably told that the sales tax rate applicable to food bags is still unclear. Notwithstanding the fact that we made a little mistake a couple of months ago, we are about to have something that is blurred around the edges continue to operate in an area which ought to be precise. Maths used to be my field before I came into this game. Now all it is is numbers-and we are usually on the wrong side of those anyway. Maths ought to be a precise science, and certainly tax ought to be a precise area of government. We are now being told that notwithstanding the correction of this mistake-and I inform the Government now that it will not be a retrospective correction-there will still be some blurring around the edges. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this change the sales tax rate applicable to food bags, I am told by those people who ought to know, namely the producers, is still unclear. Following these amendments the producers say the bags will no longer be exempted. Fine. The Australian Taxation Office has advised them that some paper bags, for example hot chicken bags-God only knows what happened to cold chicken bags-are taxable at the 10 per cent rate while others, for example hot pie bags, are taxable at the 20 per cent rate. I suggest to people that when they buy a pie they ask that it be put in a chicken bag. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fifteen per cent; otherwise take your own bag or risk burnt fingers. This matter is becoming bizarre. People in the industry argue-I take their point-that there is no basis in law for this arbitrary distinction. Even if the amendments are passed in a prospective form only, the companies will still be uncertain of future liability. This is simply not acceptable. It is not the prerogative of public servants to make up the law as they go along. At least it should be the Parliament that is to make up the law as it goes along. At the moment public servants look for mistakes and then try to correct them retrospectively. People in the community are entitled to clarity and precision, and to know where they are going and what their liabilities are. If people break a law they are entitled to know what the punishments are; if they abide by the law at any given minute they are entitled to believe that nobody is going to jump on them from a great height and extract payment retrospectively because there was an oversight or a typographical error, or somebody had a bad night the night before and did not get things quite right the first time-or sometimes even the second time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment to the legislation because it is highly inequitable to have people in this state of confusion and uncertainty. I do not think it is unreasonable to expect public servants, who are well paid, within reason to get things right in the first place and, in an area of tax which is so problematic for most people, to be precise, accurate and clear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Item 92 has provided an exemption, and will continue to provide an exemption, for sacks used for fertilisers, chaff and other primary produce. The relevant item in the Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bags and sacks used for fertilizers or chaff or for marketing goods covered by any item or sub-item in this Schedule . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, bags and sacks used for wrapping exempt goods. So far as the chaff and fertilisers are concerned the exemption will continue, but the Government's legislation removes any doubt that may have arisen about the other questions-that is, wrappings or containers for covering other exempt goods. There is no record of any exemption ever having been granted under item 92 for goods in the second category-that is, goods used to wrap items that are exempt. I understand that the reason for that is that, prior to the Budget announcement, item 96 could have been used for that purpose. I do not think I can say that there has never been an application under item 92 that is relevant to the wrapping of exempt goods, but certainly there has been none for a very long time, for the fairly obvious reason that item 96 was available and was an unambiguous alternative. For that reason, as I have already said, item 92 was not included in the original Budget list. </PARA>
<PARA> Some smart alecs who call themselves sales tax consultants get a living from an essentially parasitic activity; that is, searching around to see whatever loopholes they can find in any tax law and then retailing them around the place. Following the Budget announcement a number of wholesalers sought advice from the Australian Taxation Office because several large retailers, at the suggestion of sales tax consultants-for that read `parasites'-had refused to pay the tax to the wholesalers, suggesting instead that the wholesaler challenge an exemption under item 92 in the first schedule. The advice given by the Office has always been that exemption is not available under this item in respect of these goods. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also add that it is important to note that item 92 applies only to bags and sacks used for fertilisers or chaff or for marketing exempt goods. Bags used by supermarkets and department stores could not qualify for exemption under this item because most goods marketed by them are taxable. In the case of supermarkets, about 30 per cent of goods marketed are exempt, and the figure is much less in department stores. That is the way that item 92 has always been applied by the Taxation Office and, to the best of my knowledge, quite successfully. However, once it became known that these sales tax consultants were trying to market a tax avoidance scheme, advice was sought from Parliamentary Counsel as to whether item 92 should be further clarified. Advice from Parliamentary Counsel was that that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to quantify what the cost, if any, of Senator Messner's amendment would be because some of the relevant returns have not yet been received. For all we know a great wad of them could turn up tomorrow. Let me deal with the people who have apparently written to Senator Baume. They are not the innocent bystanders that Senator Baume has depicted them as being. Such people have not claimed, prior to August, exemptions pursuant to item 92 because there were other, more clear cut, items under which they could claim exemptions. But it appears that, following the pernicious activities of these sales tax consultants, some people thought, `Here is a bit of a try on. We will try on a claim under item 92 even though we have never used it before'. They thought that here was an opportunity to exploit a loophole in the sales tax system. The purpose of the Opposition's amendment is to allow them to get away with it. The Government certainly will not accept it. I regret that the Australian Democrats have seen fit to say that they will vote for the amendment but this matter is important enough for us to call a division. If this amendment is carried I will approach the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to ask the Taxation Office to assess the cost of the amendment, which, of course, will have to be done at some later time. It also seems to me quite possible that it will lead to some costly litigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that he is warning us of the consequences of our amendment. Our amendment simply stops this legislation from being retrospective. If there are consequences as a result it appears to me that they will fall on the Government. If the Minister's comment is an attempt to get us to review our decision, what does he mean by threatening legal action? Is he talking about the `parasitic consultants' who, as I understand it, are parasites simply because they have advised taxpayers how to obey the law?

<PARA> I say in conclusion that it is not illegal for people to organise their affairs to fit in with the tax law when such organisation is to the disadvantage of the Government. People throughout Australia organise their affairs legally in keeping with the tax law. As Senator Haines has quite properly said, there is such imprecision in the whole of the tax legislation that it involves a great deal of skill simply to meet the requirements of the tax law. For the Government to suggest that it is somehow improper for people to organise their affairs under the tax law as it exists seems to me a little strange. The suggestion by the Minister that the people involved are not innocent bystanders is typical of the sort of approach and smear that comes from this Government. I expect that sort of thing. It is one of the reasons I did not mention the name of any company in this debate. Senator Haines did not mention any companies either.

Some of these people-one of whom apparently has written to Senator Baume; for example, a supermarket which has been claiming exemption for the wrappings it uses mostly for non-exempt goods-have signified their intention for a try on, that is, to claim an exemption. It is probable that the Australian Taxation Office will reject that application which then, of course, opens up the prospect of litigation. The Committee should remember that this is by an allegedly aggrieved party which has never used for that purpose item 92-claims for exemption-but because the sales tax consultants had ferreted around and found a way in which they thought the intention of the law could be evaded they advised their clients accordingly and then the clients decided to have that try on. They are not innocent bystanders; they are people who have never attempted to use this item before but saw what they believed to be an opportunity to get around the spirit of the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 November this year the Australian Democrats introduced two amendments to the sales tax Bills that were similar to amendments we had introduced several times in the past. The amendments sought the removal of sales tax on two products used by people with disabilities, in particular, children with disabilities-flavoured soy milk and computers and other special aids which can be adapted for use by people with disabilities, but which were not produced specifically for people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we realise that there are people in the community who suffer from disabilities of one sort or another which impede their standard of living and which in some cases impede their capacity to learn and hence to earn an income and to take as full a part in life as possible unless they are provided with special assistance. I do not know how many members of this chamber have among their families children, in particular, who are unable to tolerate certain foods and for whom substitute foods need to be found. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator Michael Baume</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume interjects with one problem; there are others. An increasing number of children are unable to tolerate foods of one sort or another, quite frequently dairy products. In not being able to tolerate those foods they are deprived of certain proteins, vitamins and so on that are necessary to their full growth and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that, for various reasons, modern living is making it difficult for some of these youngsters, in particular, to live easy lives. Their parents are required to go looking for other sources of those proteins, vitamins and so on. One of the products that parents look to is soy milk. The Government has applied a 10 per cent tax, not to plain soy milk, but to flavoured soy milk. I cannot imagine that this is the biggest revenue raiser for the Australian Government this year. It must be a small part of the Government's tax revenue. Yet it will have a significant effect on those families where one or more children are required to consume this product because they cannot consume other products. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us who have had children know how difficult it is to make them take something which is good for them but which they do not like. If putting a bit of flavouring into a product helps them take that product more easily, I find it incomprehensible why the Government should be putting an additional 10 per cent tax on that item. The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, who is the Minister in the chamber at the moment, and I have had discussions in the past about the problems of chronic fatigue syndrome and other modern diseases that are caused by intolerance to chemicals that abound in foodstuffs and elsewhere. I would have thought that he of all people-I understand that he has had firsthand knowledge of this matter-would be interested in removing a financial impediment to alternative products, of which flavoured soy milk is one. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, our amendments also related to special aids that can be adapted for use by people with disabilities to enable them to function better but which were not specifically designed for people with disabilities. Let me run past those senators who are interested in this matter an example we have raised in the past. It was drawn to our attention a couple of years ago by a Queensland family who had a child who, as a result of his mother having taken thalidomide during pregnancy, was born with his hands attached to his shoulders. The child grew up to be a bright, lively and intelligent child. The family did its best to make sure that the child and the family led as normal a life as possible. It obviously was not possible for that child to undertake standard education with his hands joined to his shoulders. The parents quite properly sought alternative ways of furthering his education. They discovered that it was possible to adapt an ordinary computer so that the young boy could use it. If the keyboard were raised he could reach it, even though his hands were joined at the shoulders, and he could still see the screen. His chances of conducting a fulfilling education as a consequence of that were massively increased. Unfortunately there happens to be a 20 per cent sales tax on computers, a sales tax that was not removed because the computer was to be used by a child with a disability following an adaption which, I might add, added to the cost of the computer. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not looking at something which is relatively inexpensive. We are looking at something which is quite a drain on any ordinary family even when it is not adapted and even when the family does not have additional costs accruing from bringing up a child with a significant disability such as this. The family was faced with paying that extra 20 per cent. As it turned out, the company that was retailing the computer absorbed that 20 per cent sales tax and did not charge as high a profit as it could have. As a consequence, the family were able to get that computer adapted and give it to the child to use.</PARA>
<PARA> What sort of society are we when we penalise people like this? We have acknowledged in other areas of the sales tax legislation that people with disabilities deserve to be given a sales tax exemption if a medical practitioner or a qualified or registered therapist of some kind recommends that an item be provided. Let me give honourable senators some examples. If someone becomes bald as a consequence of a disease, the wig that he buys is sales tax exempt. If somebody with a disability buys a car to take himself to work and that car is adapted so that even though he has a disability he can drive it, that car is sales tax exempt. Why in heaven's name are we not extending that exemption to other special aids that can be adapted for use by people with disabilities so that they can function as normally as possible? We are not saying in this amendment, `open slather'. We are saying that, if a medical practitioner or somebody else equally qualified recommends it, as happens with other sales tax exemptions in this area, the goods concerned should also have the 20 per cent sales tax waived. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh said when we first raised this that if people can afford the 80 per cent, which is the price of the computer, they can afford the 20 per cent, which is the cost of the sales tax. I do not know whether Senator Walsh has anybody in his family with a disability or knows any family that has amongst its members a person with a disability. It may just be that the family is strapped enough to afford the 80 per cent without the additional disincentive through the financial burden of a 20 per cent sales tax. What makes it even worse is that presumably the changes that have to be made to the computer to raise the keyboard and so on add to the cost in the first place. The sales tax will be a 20 per cent tax on the original price of the computer plus the cost of the adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment does not specifically say `computers'. It says `special aids'. But we are using computers as an example because they are a classic and widely needed item in this area. If we can exempt wigs for people who are bald, if we can exempt cars for people who want to be able to work effectively, surely we should be able to exempt other special aids that allow individuals with disabilities to function as normally as possible. This is particularly urgent in an area of children's education. I might point out that a car is not exempt from sales tax unless a disabled person is using it to go to and from work. I would say that computers are being bought for children with disabilities mostly because a computer enables them to get the best value out of their education so that when they leave school they can go to work. If we are looking at work-related areas, this is one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition said that it would send this matter off to a committee. For pity's sake! We have been moving this sort of amendment for at least three years. How much longer does it take to think about this? I would have thought that the Opposition could have turned its mind over the last three years to this question without having to pass the buck to a committee. Mind you, when one of its members does not even know whether he is sitting among the Government or the Opposition, I am not at all surprised that some of them have a little difficulty in thinking through something like this. </PARA>
<PARA> All right, I cannot tell honourable senators what the cost of this will be. But Senator Michael Baume, Senator Messner and, indeed, the Minister could not tell us what the cost would be of changing the sales tax amendment that we have just changed in this place. The Australian Democrats thought it was justified, whatever the cost, that people should not pay sales tax retrospectively. If the Opposition can go into bat for a company which is hardly disabled on the question of retrospective tax over two months, I would have thought it could go into bat for a group of youngsters, and others-I am not excluding adults who want to benefit from this-who have a disability and whose whole lives can be improved as a consequence of having access to this sort of equipment. I seek leave to move together the two amendments that were circulated in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not propose to accept the amendments which Senator Haines has now moved. The amendments are, I guess, the sorts of ubiquitous amendments that keep cropping up whenever this type of legislation is before the Parliament. I note that Senator Haines attached a great deal of passion to her submission for support. Indeed, there is no criticism of passion. In fact, in this place we could do with a bit more of it from time to time in relation to beliefs that people hold dear. But no amount of passion indicates that the proposal itself is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to very briefly go to a number of reasons why the Government holds that view but, before I do so, I observe that the Opposition concurs-as I understand it-in general terms with the Government on this position, so Senator Haines has a fairly large job ahead of her to persuade both the major parties, the Government and the alternative government in this place, to her version of responsibility in tax matters on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to linger long on this, but I observe that in 1984 Senator Macklin introduced a private member's Bill which goes to this general issue. An amendment of this character has been moved to each Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill debated here since that time. The first point is, yes, the Democrats are being consistent, but its amendments have not been accepted and that is the view of both the Government and the Opposition. The point raised by Senator Haines has been considered in Budget deliberations by various governments over many years. Each time the decision taken has been not to amend the law, because of the problems involved and the cost to revenue. In 1984, the estimated cost to revenue was $150m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimated cost in 1984 was $150m. I believe that is the cost attached to the Macklin private member's Bill, to answer Senator Baume's interjection. We would say, as well, that the proposed amendment is too wide-ranging; that the existing sales tax exemptions for disabled and handicapped persons apply to specific goods. To this extent they are self-policing, because there is no incentive to get the benefits of the exemption for people without disabilities, given that the goods can only be used by disabled persons. On that basis, I reject the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Government claims too much support from the Opposition, let us be clear about what the Opposition's view is. The Opposition certainly shares the concern of the Australian Democrats about the Government, in effect, prospering at the expense of the handicapped. It was because of that concern that in the past we have taken strong and positive views about exempting some matters from taxation when we have been in government. The problem here is one which emerges, in effect, from the response of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) where he alleged that $150m would be the cost to revenue if the general proposition outlined in 1984 by Senator Macklin--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right, but taking this situation to its logical conclusion which is, in fact, the Macklin Bill I would imagine, the first question clearly is: Is this the best way of spending $150m on people who are handicapped?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. It is not patronising. The second question is: Are there better ways of providing a more meaningful assistance to the handicapped than the way being proposed in this legislation, which tends to benefit only those people who are rich enough to be able to afford the large items on which there will be a significant sales tax benefit? What I am suggesting is that there may well be better ways of providing assistance, particularly to those people who are handicapped but not nearly as well off and who do not even have the base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I am saying is that they are questions that have to be looked at. We can be criticised for not having looked at them earlier. That would be a reasonable basis for objection. If the Democrats were to object on that basis I would acknowledge their position. The reality is that the Government has consistently said that there are problems relating to cost and to administration. If there are problems relating to cost and administration, let the Government argue that case clearly and properly. Let it be subject to cross-examination; let it be examined. The place for it to be examined is in a Senate committee inquiry. That is why the Opposition says, `Look, there is a sound case for the Government not prospering at the cost of the handicapped,'-which is what it is doing. According to the Government it is prospering to the extent of $150m, if it were taken to the logical conclusion of the Macklin Bill. </PARA>

As Senator Walsh interjects, that cost is largely made up of people using loopholes in such legislation, where the full benefit of such special advantages may not be limited only to people with handicaps; others may take some advantages as a result of on sales, on purchases, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get this matter very simple and clear: Is the answer to provide, instead of the sales tax benefit, some sort of rebate? Is it better to have a higher grant? Is it better to have no sales tax? What is the best way of providing this? Should there be a subsidy for people who want to buy these kinds of things? There are many technical ways of going about it. There are many important and significant problems, according to the Government, which have to be examined. The Democrats have waited for four years and have raised this matter for four years. They have a sound point that something should be done to examine this properly. It has not been done over the four years and that is why the Opposition is very keen indeed to have a Senate inquiry. </PARA>

Let us combine to get the Government into a situation where it has to respond to the sound points which the Democrats have been making. What is wrong with that approach? Do I get the impression from Senator Haines that, because it has not been done immediately and the Democrats have waited for four years, the Democrats are rejecting the concept I am putting up? The Government would be forced to come clean, to explain absolutely perfectly why it objects to this kind of assistance to the handicapped and what the technical, administrative and financial impediments are that the Government has continually claimed exist without ever providing details of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why I believe it would be wrong to try to resolve this problem on the run, the way the Democrats' amendment does. There are clear implications, not simply in this respect, but in terms of the natural consequences, why it should clearly go to such a Senate committee. The Opposition will be examining the preparation of such a submission in the near future, because it believes that this is a matter of very real significance.

<PARA> I remind the Government, which seems to have lost sight of this basic philosophical item since Senator Grimes left this chamber, that the Act that the Government put into place-the Disability Services Act-contains within it a philosophy directly consistent with this: that disabled people ought to be the ones who generate what their desires are, and that what the bureaucrats may think is better for them is neither here nor there. That is the Government's official philosophy. It enshrined that clearly in the Act. It is to give back the control of the lives of disabled people so that they can make decisions about their lives and not have them made for them. We applauded that at the time. I still believe that is the Government's official position. There are many problems with pursuing that particular philosophy, but at its very guts it is the correct philosophical stance to take with regard to this. This particular item is totally consistent with that philosophical approach that the Government has enshrined in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the item relating to a Senate committee, the Senate may not be aware that Madam Chair, Senator Zakharov, moved a motion a month ago to send this matter to a committee, and it has gone there. That was on 10 November. If people would like to look, the new reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, chaired by Madam Chair, relates to the employment of disabled people. In the new terms of reference there is this item. I wish to register my thanks to Senator Zakharov for moving so speedily on this matter and for picking up the obvious concerns that the Senate expressed last time we debated this issue. It is a pity that the other people who have spoken have not noted that we had already done that. The Government came back with this item. We believe that this item is a clear and very simple procedure. The amounts involved are infinitesimal. But whatever they are, it really is not of great concern. I think Senator Harradine put this very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with an issue that is not going to go away. We are dealing with the new approach, not the old approach. The old approach was a very difficult one. Many of the items that we had concern about were specifically generated for disabled people. They are exempt and everybody wants them to be and they will continue to be. What we are talking about are not those types of items. We are talking about items such as cars and computers that have to be modified, or any other general aid the use of which as a special aid the medical practitioners or qualified or registered occupational therapist has certified as being necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government, in terms of its own recent movements in the area, that Senator Haines was referring to the child disability allowance, which is also running into a great deal of trouble. I might keep that for another occasion. That particular allowance is actually generated in an identical fashion. An application is made by the parents of the child. It goes through a recommendation from the person's medical practitioner or occupational therapist and then it is assessed, often by a social worker from the Department. We are not going outside the established procedures. If those particular methods open up tax loopholes, this one will. If they do not, this one will not. We are linking in to the established procedures. I believe this is the correct way. I believe there is no evidence that they open up tax loopholes. I certainly will be interested if there is evidence of this, because it would mean that the programs which are currently in place are being used as tax loopholes. There is no evidence of their being used that way. On that basis, it is a reasonable proposition to continue to put to the Senate. I would hope as a result of that, if it is defeated, at least the next time it will be raised-I can assure the Government and the Opposition that it will be raised again-we shall be able to have a more informed debate on the way in which these items have been investigated and a clearer position will be able to be taken by both of the major parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the view that Senator Macklin has just proposed. There should be a more informed debate, which is one of the reasons we wanted this matter referred to a Senate committee. Senator Macklin said that this matter had already been referred. That is not strictly so because the matter referred relates to the employment of disabled persons. As far as we are concerned, this matter should not be limited to special aids relating only to employment but should cover aids in general to handicapped people. We want to at least have an inquiry that broadens the approach that Senator Macklin just raised. Quite frankly, the proposition he put to us, that this matter is already before the Senate Committee, is not strictly so. I want to stress that we want exactly the sort of informed debate which Senator Macklin has not been able to encourage the chamber to have in four years. That is why we believe it is absolutely vital that this matter go, in a full sense, to a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Michael Baume spoke the time before last he drew attention to a couple of important items, on both of which I had, I think, commented before. They relate to the fact that the proposal under the amendment might do something for the relatively affluent handicapped who can afford the initial purchase price; it does not do anything for the non-affluent who cannot afford the purchase price. Also, it might, in an unintended way, do a great deal more for the non-handicapped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the question of a Senate inquiry, obviously the terms of reference of such an inquiry should address such things as administrative difficulties and administrative costs, program costs, revenue losses or whatever. I suggest that the terms of reference might also address the question of the offset in savings required in terms of the cost implications of whatever recommendations may come forward from such an inquiry or, alternatively, the increased revenue that would be required to offset whatever increased cost might come forward. Subject to an examination of the detailed terms of reference, I believe that the Government would support such a reference. </PARA>

<PARA>Reasons of the House of Representatives for disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 1 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed requirement that the individual be informed in writing would be burdensome for agencies and of limited benefit to some individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>Information Privacy Principle 2 is expressed in terms that would cover a wide range of collection practices of agencies and can be tailored to suit a variety of circumstances. The Privacy Commissioner is empowered to issue guidelines on what would be sufficient information for an individual to be made generally aware of the purpose of collection, the legal authority for the collection and the usual disclosure practices of the collector.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 2 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>There are practical difficulties in imposing an obligation on agencies to check the accuracy of personal information at the time of collection.</PARA>
<PARA>Information Privacy Principle 3 requires a record-keeper collecting personal information to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is relevant to the purpose of collection, up to date and complete. The record-keeper is also required to ensure that the collection of the information does not intrude to an unreasonable extent upon the personal affairs of the individual concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Information Privacy Principles 7 and 8 provide important privacy safeguards for individuals by requiring record-keepers to correct inaccuracies before making any use of information in records.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 3 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>Information Privacy Principle 5 requires the record-keeper to provide information to enable any person to ascertain the main purposes for which that information is used.</PARA>
<PARA>Agencies may have a range of purposes for which personal information is used. It would be impractical to require agencies to set out all the possible purposes for which information held by an agency is used.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 4 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is directed to enabling a person to find out the information handling practices of the record-keeper. The Information Privacy Principles already do this. Information Privacy Principle 2 requires information to be provided by record-keepers about their disclosure practices. Information Privacy Principle 5 also requires the record-keeper to maintain a public record setting out extensive information about the personal records kept and how to obtain access to those records.</PARA>
<PARA>The Privacy Commissioner is empowered to issue guidelines on the safe storage and security of records of personal information. It is not appropriate for individuals to be given details of security controls on information held by a record-keeper.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 5 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>It is a condition for the handling of a complaint as a representative complaint that the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that the class of persons making complaints is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable. The Commissioner can waive this condition if justice demands that the matter be dealt with as a representative complaint. Accordingly, the awarding of compensation to each member of the class is likely to give rise to practical difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of representative complaints, the main remedy is likely to be the cessation of the act or practice giving rise to the complaint rather than compensation. A similar approach has been taken in relation to complaints under the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA>An individual who believes compensation is justifiable can bring an individual complaint notwithstanding that a representative complaint has been brought.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 6 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>It is a condition for the handling of a complaint as a representative complaint that the Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that the class of persons making a complaint is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable. The Commissioner can waive this condition if justice demands that the matter be dealt with as a representative complaint. Accordingly, the awarding of expenses for costs incurred in making the complaint to each member of the class is likely to give rise to practical difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 7 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>The provision should not be deleted as the definition of complainant in relation to a representative complaint needs to include all the persons on whose behalf the complaint is made.</PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendment No. 9 is not acceptable because-</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides a right to complain to the Privacy Commissioner, who conducts an investigation and may award compensation. This will give the Australian people a simple and effective remedy. For most people, it will be a more accessible and cheaper remedy than an action in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the approach the Parliament has adopted for other interferences with the rights of individuals in the areas of sex discrimination and race discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA> An injunction can also be obtained from the Federal Court to restrain a breach of the Privacy Act. The remedy enables the Privacy Commissioner or an individual to get a privacy infringing practice stopped.</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Walsh) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee does not insist upon the amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Bill 1988, which has been brought back to us from the House of Representatives, is the twin brother, so to speak, of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill. The two pieces of legislation were due to go together and were brought before the Parliament as a result of a deal done between the Government and the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the failure of the Australia Card legislation the Government moved to introduce a tax file numbering system, which contained a number of requirements of individuals with regard to the quoting of their tax file number, that I do not intend to go into at the moment, and was given assurances by the Opposition that that legislation would be supported if privacy legislation were introduced at the same time. I do not know what requirements the Opposition placed on the privacy legislation with regard to its efficiency or effectiveness, but certainly this piece of legislation does not seem to fit the bill. We discovered that on the first occasion that this legislation was before the Senate, when we moved a number of amendments that were supported by the Opposition and when the Opposition moved amendments that we then supported. So the Government was faced with a piece of privacy legislation that had a significant number of amendments made to its operation-to the information privacy principles, to appeals mechanisms and to the capacity of an individual to take an action for damages before a civil court. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go on to those, I want to raise a peripheral matter with regard to the whole concept of a tax file number and the attendant privacy legislation. We were assured by the Government, with the support of the Opposition, that the tax file number legislation would not be intrusive and would not particularly endanger people's privacy but that, just to make absolutely sure of that fact, it would do two things: introduce privacy legislation that covered, I might add, only the public sector and not the private sector and also write into the tax file number legislation a provision that gave people the option of whether or not to quote their tax file number to their employer, the bank, the building society, the stockbroker and so on. So what that amendment did was to make it optional. It removed a section in the original legislation that would have created an offence if somebody had not quoted his tax file number. That was fine as far as it went; but what also applied was a penalty. You do not commit an offence by not quoting your tax file number, but you do accrue a tax of 50.25c in the dollar. We made the point during the debate on this that this was a pay-off by the Opposition to some of their wealthy supporters in the community who can afford to wear that sort of penalty. People on average weekly earnings and less do not have that option. So they are required to quote their tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been drawn to my attention since the passage of that legislation is that there is at least one major employing agency in New South Wales which, a couple of weeks ago, sent all its employees home to get hold of their tax file numbers before it agreed to pay them. So much for the legislation and the fact that it is not compulsory to quote one's tax file number. People out there have not got any idea at all how this is working. If employers do not, or for some reason of their own choose to ignore it, what employee is going to know the ins and outs of an intricate piece of legislation like the tax file legislation? What use is the Privacy Bill, even if it worked and was effective, when those sorts of things happen? I can give the Minister the name of the employer group if he is at all interested in pursuing this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators came into this place a couple of weeks ago, decided that there were enough holes in the privacy legislation to drive a fleet of trucks through and, between us and the Opposition, moved a series of amendments. For example, these required that the information collected about somebody had to be accurate. That does not seem a particularly unreasonable expectation about information that is stored on people in areas of tax, social security, health or anywhere else. It is a simple requirement that the information be not only up to date and complete but also accurate. The Opposition supported us in that. The Democrats also thought it might not be unreasonable if people were told the purposes for which the information that was being collected on them was to be used; not just the main purpose at the time, but the other purposes for which the information was to be used. The Opposition agreed with that. The Democrats thought that it was not unreasonable that people should know what happened to the information, how it was stored, how it was collated, how it was altered, how it was used, to whom it was going to be released and why. The Opposition agreed with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition raised a few matters of its own. It said that the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was a necessary adjunct to all the other clauses in the Privacy Bill if it were to be meaningful and effective. That seemed not unreasonable, although it would cost people an arm and a leg. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Justice to the secret briefing given by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) to State and Federal Attorneys-General, including representatives of the Western Australian Government, last Friday on its in camera investigations of Rothwells Ltd. I ask: Given that the conduct of the Western Australian Government and of Western Australian Government instrumentalities is a key to the whole Rothwells debacle and the losses of small shareholders and creditors, does the briefing not demonstrate that the NCSC investigation will not include the conduct of the Western Australian Government? Does it not also indicate, therefore, that assurances as to the scope of the inquiry given to the Senate last week by the Minister are not well founded and that the Attorney-General should exercise his powers under the Act to direct a full and open investigation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3676" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think it is correct to conclude that the investigations being undertaken by the National Companies and Securities Commission-I think it was under section 35 of the relevant legislation-into the events surrounding the collapse of Rothwells will be restricted in any way to what might be called non-government entities. The fact is that it has sought to commence these investigations and exercise the very considerable powers available to it under section 36 to compel the attendance of witnesses and to require the production of documents. I am sure that the NCSC would not undertake a partial or fragmented investigation into the events surrounding the collapse of Rothwells.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is something of an improper reflection-if I can put it that way-on the member of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities from Western Australia, Mr Joe Berinson, the Attorney-General of that State, to suggest that his presence would somehow inhibit the proper investigation of these matters by the National Companies and Securities Commission. I believe that the Ministerial Council, which is composed of Ministers drawn from all shades of political opinion, representing, as it does, all jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory, would have subjected the National Companies and Securities Commission representatives, led by Mr Bosch, to the most critical examination of the proposed agenda for their investigations. Having not been present myself-and even if I had been present, no doubt not being able to disclose the details of that meeting-I am not suggesting that the operational or fine detail of the investigation was put to the meeting by Mr Bosch and the members of the National Companies and Securities Commission. I do not believe, therefore, that there is any foundation for suggesting that the time has come for a new level or a new type of investigation to be undertaken such as the Opposition has pressed for over several months now. I believe that, had the Ministers, drawn from many jurisdictions, thought that the NCSC investigation was somehow cramped, would be inadequate or would not reveal sufficient of the truth concerning the alleged illegality surrounding the collapse of Rothwells, then they would have ensured that another course was undertaken. They have not. I believe the foundation has not been laid for any move away from the course set by the NCSC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs explain to the Senate why the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs released Mr Kurtovic, a man convicted of manslaughter, from custody? Did this occur whilst Mr Kurtovic was being detained by Immigration pending deportation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3677" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been informed by my Department that my predecessor, Mr Young, signed a deportation order against Mr Kurtovic on 28 January this year. Mr Kurtovic was convicted in July 1983 of the manslaughter by shooting of his parents-in-law. The Crown accepted a plea of manslaughter, rather than murder, on psychiatric evidence of diminished responsibility from a depressive psychosis. This was said to have been precipitated by domestic disputes with his wife and parents-in-law. His young daughter witnessed the shooting. There is no doubt that this was a very serious offence. A sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period to expire on 15 December 1985 was imposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A previous deportation order had been signed in 1984. This was revoked on the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, Mr Young considered this year that there were new facts regarding Mr Kurtovic's mental state which indicated that Mr Kurtovic could constitute a risk to the Australian community, particularly Mr Kurtovic's former in-laws. They have persistently expressed fears of Mr Kurtovic, particularly regarding his former wife, who has custody of their child, and a desire that he be deported.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's criminal deportation policy is based on an assessment of four broad criteria: the seriousness of the offence; the risk of recidivism; the person's ties with and contribution to Australia; and hardship suffered by both the person and Australian citizens if deportation takes place. These were the primary considerations to which Mr Young had regard.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kurtovic was held in immigration custody pending deportation from February this year immediately following his release from prison. Since then he has been pursuing various avenues of appeal, though I am informed that he sought release from custody only after some months. Mr Kurtovic sought review of the decisions to keep him in immigration custody, but the hearing of this application has not yet been completed. The usual course when administrative decisions are challenged in the Federal Court is to remit the decision for reconsideration, though the court does have power to quash such decisions. However, Mr Justice Einfeld made an interim order that Mr Kurtovic be released subject to certain conditions. In releasing Mr Kurtovic as an interim measure, Mr Justice Einfeld considered that there was a serious question as to whether the Migration Act allowed an authorised officer to take into account the seriousness of a deportee's offences and the risk of further offences in deciding whether to take or hold such a person in custody pending deportation.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that Mr Justice Einfeld, having decided that there was a serious question to be tried, considered that it was not appropriate that his consideration of that issue should be rushed. On the evidence before him and with the conditions he imposed, he felt the risk of Mr Kurtovic absconding and of committing further offences was acceptable and he should be released immediately pending his decision in the case or until further order. The view that any risk should be borne or that the risk is acceptable in this case is not shared by my Department or by me, and Mr Kurtovic's release has been strenuously opposed. I intend, and so does my Department, to lodge an appeal on this particular matter against Mr Justice Einfeld's decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His Leader is like Senator Hill. Senator Hill anticipates; his Leader leads his regiment from behind and does not even get the facts right. There is a new vigour in the system due to the enforcement approach adopted by Customs, unlike the passive methods which have existed in the past. It is rather absurd at this stage to contemplate further changes to Coastwatch, at a time when it is now being successfully managed, because of some vague ideological disposition. It is necessary to remind the Opposition that the bulk of coastal surveillance is for civil purposes such as immigration, quarantine, anti-smuggling and so on. These are not tasks which should be allocated expensive and specialised military equipment, which is designed for quite different roles. Even so, defence equipment does back up civil tasks. Naval patrol boats are an obvious example and this is why the Government has allocated certain levels of naval and Air Force resources to support Coastwatch operations when appropriate and when sensible in terms of the resources which have to be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I further make the point that the Customs Service is one of the few government agencies with resources spread throughout remote parts of northern Australia. It is located in areas where not even the defence forces are based. It is the ideal body to have responsibility for Coastwatch. All the indications are that the Government's decision to place Coastwatch with Customs has been the correct one.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question does call for a little background, which I will briefly give. In the context of the 1980 Federal election the coalition-I am not sure whether it was through Nixon or Anthony-gave a commitment to the Queensland Government that it would contribute to a joint Commonwealth-State funding arrangement to support the Bundaberg irrigation scheme. Of course, Bundaberg was the centre of what was arguably a sensitive seat. That commitment, naturally, has been honoured by this Government. The last $4m instalment to Queensland was brought forward by me and paid earlier than required in recognition of the harsh wet season experienced in Bundaberg and the difficulties being experienced by farmers in that area. As a consequence of that, too, the Queensland Government, through Don Neal, the State Minister for Water Resources and Maritime Services, approached this Government earlier this year to write a new agreement to continue funding further. The original agreement reached back in 1980 was that the Commonwealth pay $4m a year and the State $6m a year, and that arrangement was to last for eight years in order to fund the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The complaint of the Queensland Government now is that the original agreement did not take account of inflation. But it is clear that the Queensland Government, with its eyes open, signed the agreement to accept the proposal of the Commonwealth, as put forward in 1980. One must accept that the Queensland Government understood all the way through the conditions of this agreement. Now it has asked for more Commonwealth money. The Queensland Government has proposed that the Commonwealth contribute $6m to its $9m for years one and two and that the total payout for the scheme in year three be $7m, based on the same proportions. So far so good. What is the context of Mr Courtice's remarks? When the Commonwealth got this request from the Queensland Government we said that we wanted to specify two things. Firstly, we wanted a cost-benefit review of the scheme in order to be sure that if we were to consider further funding, the Commonwealth dollar would, in terms of water resources, be spent properly. Secondly, we wanted an indication from the Queensland Government of when the scheme might be completed, because it is now running on for many more years than was originally anticipated. On the basis of our specifying those things, the joint Commonwealth-State working party was formed. A consultant's report was commissioned by that working party to deal with those points, and it is the timing and delivery of that report over which this issue arises. I saw Don Neal in September. He indicated then that the report was some weeks away from being delivered to me. I am advised by my Department today that the joint Commonwealth-State working party may clear for presentation to Mr Neal and me the document from the consultants some time this week, and thus I would expect to have it before me close to but certainly before Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Courtice has pointed out that Minister Neal in the Queensland Parliament indicated that the report had in fact been sent to the Commonwealth, and, as I have said, we have not yet received it. That is the point of the dispute. The strength of the Government's argument certainly lies with Mr Courtice, who is an outstanding local member in the Bundaberg area. He invited me to Bundaberg to meet the Isis farmers. I accepted his invitation, and they expressed their concerns about the delay. In terms of the bureaucratic chain that has been put in place for the clearance of all these things, the delay of two months is perhaps not a long delay; but for the farmers in the Bundaberg area experiencing difficulties because of the recent lack of rains, two months could be, if they are uncertain about their future, a quite serious and important delay. When I receive the final report I propose to expedite the Commonwealth's dealing with it, and if we do see in that report a case for further funding to complete works now in progress that will be dealt with appropriately in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> Public controversy has been generated in Queensland over Commonwealth funding for works involving dam construction in that State. Queensland has nominated to the Commonwealth the Burdekin dam and surrounding work as a key priority, as well as the Bundaberg project. I make the observation, however, that the Queensland Government has chosen to divert its own State funds to other projects. The Barker-Barambah dam, which is colloquially known as the Bjelke-Petersen memorial dam, has been fully funded by the Queensland Government, and also the Kroombit dam and the Peter Faust dam are in prospect. One would have thought that if the priority assigned to the Burdekin and Bundaberg projects were to be held to by the Queensland Government, it would have diverted more funding to those projects rather than give the projects I have just referred to a direct priority over and above the Commonwealth-State priority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to figures published in the Australian Business magazine in 30 November, the Elders grain division earned just over $160m in export revenue in 1987 and is expected to earn $170m this year. Of course, that is the gross value-probably the f.o.b. value-of sales; it is not the value added by Elders. That puts the Elders grain division in a quite credible forty-sixth place in the table of Australia's top 500 exporters. The advertisements featuring the figure of $5.7 billion relates to the export revenues earned by the Elders wool division. I have already mentioned in the Senate that the $5.7 billion figure is a very serious misrepresentation. The value of wool exported by Elders in the relevant year was $380m, not the $5.7 billion as the advertisements imply. Those advertisements also refer to Elders-IXL Ltd, the whole of the company group, as being 110 per cent Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In yesterday's Australian Financial Review there appeared an article from which I will quote four sections. I make it clear in the beginning that they are not continuous, but the article states:</PARA>

<PARA> The move follows the effective relocation of Elders giant brewing division in London . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I granted refugee status to these Somalis on 21 October 1988. At the time the Australian Government took the view that, as they arrived on an Italian naval vessel in Italian uniform and had been resident in Italy for some years, the Italian Government bore the major responsibility for their ultimate resettlement. Negotiations with the Italian Government were initiated on this basis. The Italian Government's lack of a substantial response and its prevarication were fairly disappointing, particularly in view of the history of cooperation over the years between our two countries. I am most concerned at the Italian Government's very uncooperative attitude on the fate of the Somalis. It would not even categorically rule out their involuntary return to Somalia, thus calling into question Italy's reputation as a humanitarian nation. In the circumstances, I have decided to approve in principle the grant of permanent resident status to the Somalis, thereby demonstrating that Australia is willing to live up to its obligations under the United Nations convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that, in view of the Italian Government's rather unhelpful attitude, I have decided to consider a reduction in the very generous assistance Australia has traditionally provided in resettling refugees seeking asylum in Italy. Instead, my Department may-I stress the word `may'-make some of these places available to other parts of the world. For many years Australia has been regarded as a country that will always cooperate on refugee matters, but when we seek the cooperation of other countries it is rarely forthcoming.

The principal legal officer himself then commented on the first opinion, and a further opinion was received from Mr Adams.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators say that he is not distinguished. That might be their view, but my view is that he is a distinguished commentator. He described the document as `a volume of platitudes, propaganda and prejudice', not as a policy document. Let me go to the questions of substance on LPG that Senator Beahan has asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government earlier this year released a discussion paper on LPG pricing. We received over 40 submissions from State governments, from the industry, from local governments, and from consumers. It is not surprising that the balance was that most of the LPG producers favour complete deregulation but that the distributors, local government, consumers, and so on, support a continuance of the regulated market. On 11 October I announced that with effect from 1 February next year we would move towards a free market in LPG while providing-and this is an important proviso-protection for the consumers. I said that we would ask the Prices Surveillance Authority to determine maximum wholesale prices of LPG in each capital city, that we would retain export controls as a reserve power to ensure that there was not a flight of LPG overseas thus forcing up domestic prices, and that we would see that the domestic market was properly supplied. I think that was a sensible balance between the need to deregulate and the need to protect consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has proposed in its document to jump into the void and move to a completely deregulated market. To do so would be not to recognise the unique characteristics of LPG. There is limited competition in this field. There are big transport and storage costs as well, which cause the market to be different from the crude oil market, which we deregulated at the beginning of this year. The Opposition does not offer any safeguards, except the platitude that it would take the interests of country consumers into account.</PARA>
<PARA> I was rather surprised to find that, in this section of the document, the Liberal Party-or Mr Howard, or whoever claims ownership of the document-has moved so far down the ideological path it has. When we released our discussion paper about the prospects of a free market, as a Minister I received, from a person who I understand is now my Opposition shadow spokesman in the House of Representatives, a Mr Peter McGauran, a plaintive lobby not to deregulate the LPG market. He said, `Do not deregulate it. Keep it as it is, as a regulated market'. He is the shadow energy spokesman for the coalition. I now find the coalition document calling for the reverse of what he was proposing.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McGauran's was not the only voice calling for the retention of a regulated market. A number of other Opposition spokesmen called for regulation to continue in the way we had administered it until now. Those Opposition spokesmen were: Charles Blunt, Noel Hicks, John Sharp, Tim Fischer, Wal Fife and, in this chamber, Senator David Brownhill. They all made lobbies or requests to me as the Minister to retain the regulated market. We have gone to partial deregulation, with the price being fixed by the Prices Surveillance Authority. On what basis has the coalition now issued a policy going against the interests of people who are predominantly representatives of country electorates-electorates which would be most adversely affected if the move to a deregulated market, as contemplated by the coalition policy documents, were to be carried out?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by citing some figures as to the likely impact of moving to a deregulated market as proselytised in the coalition's document. The ex-refinery wholesale prices of LPG would increase significantly with complete deregulation. The estimates of price increases are as follow: $20 to $30 per tonne in the Melbourne metropolitan area, a price increase of 1c to 1.5c per litre; in the Sydney metropolitan area, $70 to $80 per tonne, a price increase of 3.5c to 4c per litre; and in the Brisbane metropolitan area, $100 to $110 per tonne, a price increase of 5c to 5.5c per litre. If we are talking about country consumers we are talking about further loading the metropolitan price increases with transport costs and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> What the coalition's document-that document of platitude, propaganda and prejudice-proposes is a significantly higher price for LPG, particularly for country consumers but also for metropolitan consumers. This is in direct contrast to what many Opposition members, in private correspondence to me, have requested.</PARA>

I specifically asked the Minister about the statement made about when the audit report on the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation was first brought to the attention of Minister Hand. I remind the Leader of the Government that on the basis of information produced by his Minister in this place yesterday, following the introduction of the same document by Senator Short, Mr Hand was advised of the existence of this document in July 1987, and on the basis of other documents introduced into the Senate by both Senator Tate and Senator Bolkus it is quite clear that Minister Hand was again advised of the existence of that document before the end of August this year.

If Senator Chaney chooses to characterise the response as a misleading of the Senate, that does not necessarily mean that such an event took place. The Government's position on that issue was made quite clear yesterday. I am aware that Mr Hand was given documents in July 1987 and again on 30 August, I think, or 31 August 1988 which referred to that document.

<PARA> That the Senate censures the Prime Minister for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) his failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility in relation to the misleading of Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in contrast with the standards adhered to by the Hon. John Brown who resigned because he misled parliament</PARA>
<PARA> (b) his failure to uphold even the principles concerning the misleading of Parliament applied by the Whitlam government and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>We bring this motion forward because there are two matters of immediate and major concern. One is the proper functioning of this Parliament, the proper functioning of parliamentary democracy in this country, which depends upon accurate information being given to the Parliament by Ministers and those other people who provide the information to us. That is a fundamental requirement if we are to have an effective Westminster system of government in Australia. We can clearly demonstrate that those standards have not been met by the Government and that that is to the detriment of this institution, the Senate, and the Parliament generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an extraordinary thing that one can point to an area where the Hawke Government has shown even lower standards than those which were displayed by the Whitlam Government. At least in the time of that Government we saw examples of Ministers having misled the House of Representatives or having caused the House of Representatives to be misled and the immediate requirement by the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, that they resign. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major concern which we have and which I wish to touch on briefly at this stage of the debate is that, whilst there are important institutional reasons for being concerned at any case of the Parliament being misled, there are also very serious long term and long held concerns about the maladministration of Aboriginal affairs under the Hawke Government not just in 1988 under Minister Hand but for the whole of the period of the Hawke Labor Government. I intend to address that matter in the limited way that is possible in a debate of this type, but I want to make the point that the substance of the concerns that we have goes to the blighting of the lives of a generation of Aboriginal Australians. Whilst it is true that there are many Aboriginal Australians who are taking advantage of the opportunities which this country offers to build better lives for themselves, it is also true that in settlements around Australia, in the cities and suburbs of Australia, this Government's failures in the administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs are resulting in intense damage being done to a generation of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke to some senior members of Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory just a few months ago about what is happening to the next generation of Aboriginal people they agreed with me that the very promising group who were coming through into the community 20 years ago are not being replaced under the confusion of administration that is currently occurring. We see the situation where a whole generation will be blighted unless this Government takes a grip on this key policy area, stops engaging in tokenism and symbolism and stops the sort of self-indulgence that we have seen from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and from the Ministers who have held this portfolio, and unless we see a genuine commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility. We heard in the answer which was given by Senator Button the sort of obfuscation we have had from the Government ever since this matter was raised originally in the House of Representatives by Roger Shipton but consistently in this Senate over recent days. Senator Button likes to state that in some mysterious way it is a matter of opinion as to whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, has misled the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to spend time on the detailed discussion and argument that we had in this chamber only yesterday on the original complaint which we had about Mr Hand and his statement that he had not approved the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO). That is a matter on which there has been some confusion because of conflict within minutes that have been produced. The fact is that there is some room for the sort of argument that Senator Button has put forward here this afternoon. But there is absolutely no room for the sort of argument that has been made by Senator Button when one looks at the material which has been made available by the Government in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote precisely what was said by Minister Hand in a statement settled by him, tabled in this Senate and read into the record of this Senate by Senator Bolkus in the absence of Senator Tate. I quote from the prepared statement of Mr Hand. Referring to the auditor's report on NAIHO, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very simple statement. What the Minister is saying is that it was not until 8 September that the auditor's report which was sought by the previous Minister and which was a prelude to the refusal to further fund NAIHO was drawn to his attention. The Government itself, however, has introduced into this Parliament documents which show that when the Minister was originally briefed by his Department in July of 1987 he was provided with a brief on the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation and that that brief clearly set out the reasons why a Minister would be concerned about his dealings with NAIHO. </PARA>
<PARA> The brief refers to the receipt of more than $1m of public money. It refers to the fact that NAIHO has not lived up to the expectations of either Aboriginal people or the Government. It refers to the fact that despite repeated requests NAIHO has failed to account adequately for its funds or to provide considered and timely advice. Most significantly for the purpose of this debate, it also said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Minister instructed that the accounts and administrative practices be audited in depth. The independent and professional auditor, Arthur Andersen and Co., found that NAIHO's system of internal control of operations and finance was inadequate . . . </PARA>

Again I simply remind the Senate that this is like Senator Tate's lack of preparedness on this matter and Senator Bolkus's lack of preparedness on this matter: they simply are not familiar with the documents which have been tabled in this place. It is typical of the slackness of their approach to the administration of Aboriginal affairs. I direct the attention of the Minister to the two attachments to the memorandum of August. The first attachment refers on the second page to the independent audit. The second attachment refers to the Arthur Andersen audit and the nature of the concerns which are expressed in that audit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are the simple facts of this matter and it is absurd for the Government to suggest that the Minister did not mislead the House or the Senate, because the Minister, in his public statements, has indicated that he accepts that he did mislead the Senate. Let me quote the Minister. Let me not bandy words with the honourable senator for the Australian Capital Territory, who has so pathetically tried to defend the indefensible over the last 24 hours. Mr Hand has said:</PARA>
<PARA>What I was saying that the first time `it' had been brought to my attention, meaning the document . . . itself-</PARA>
<PARA>so he is referring to the fact that he meant something else other than what was said in that statement-</PARA>
<PARA>I would hardly have tabled a series of documents within 10 minutes referring to the Arthur Andersen report if I was intending to mislead Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise to people if my interpretation of what the word `it' means is different from those in the Senate. Quite clearly, the 8th was the first time the document was given to me. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hand admitted that, on two or three occasions before then, aspects of the report had been brought to his attention. When asked again if his statement was misleading he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it wasn't designed to be misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>How can the Government assert that the statement is not misleading when it requires that sort of explanation from the Minister? He is saying that he meant something quite different from the clear meaning of the words which were put into this place in a statement approved by him, namely, that 8 September was the first time that the document was drawn to his attention-not that he saw the document; not that he held it in his hands; but that it was drawn to his attention. I think that if Mr Hand is denying the allegation he should sue the newspapers which have headlined this morning that Hand misled both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter which no person of goodwill, or even of ill will, could misconstrue. Mr Hand has misled the Senate on at least one occasion, if not more. We find Mr Hand taking refuge in the defence that he meant something else; that his misleading was innocent. In that context, I think it is instructive to turn to what was said by John Brown just a year ago when he also was found to have misled the Parliament. In that case, the misleading involved Mr Brown advising the House of Representatives that there had been a 2 : 2 vote in a committee which was set up to monitor the awarding of a contract for Expo. It subsequently transpired that the vote was 4 : 2. The Minister in that case explained the difference on the basis that he had not understood that two public servants were allowed a vote. Let me quote what only a year ago John Brown was saying about the situation in which he found himself, and contrast the position with that of Mr Gerry Hand. </PARA>

That may well be the case, but all we can do is say that the clear obligation on the Government is to impose the standards which have been laid down in the Parliament time and time again, including by previous Labor governments and even within the life of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not some unimportant matter. I want to address that point, because some people have raised with me, as a genuine query: does it matter whether the Parliament is misled on a matter in a way where the man might be innocent in what he has done? I wish to say that it is a very serious matter for the Parliament, that we insist on the most careful standards in this area. I address these comments particularly to those Australian Democrats and members of the Nuclear Disarmament Party who chose to vote against the motion we brought into the Parliament yesterday and who obviously paid much less regard to this principle than did the three members of the Australian Democrats who voted with the Opposition. I would agree with the comment in an editorial of the London Observer, of 16 September, which was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>We may sometimes scoff at the way in which the British Parliament regards lying to its members as the most serious sin imaginable, but the convention serves a purpose. It is the only way for Parliament to keep a check on the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth of the matter is that unless we can rely upon the truth of what is told us in this place we cannot function as a parliament. I would like to acknowledge the explanation of that given by Senator Macklin in the debate yesterday. In the Senate Hansard of yesterday at page 3584, Senator Macklin said:</PARA>
<PARA>Misleading the Senate is extremely serious, and so it should be, because we have to rely on what we are told by Ministers. That is the only way in which this place can operate. It is a serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later, when he was quoting what the Minister was saying, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>`This is the very first time that this has been drawn to my attention'. It is obvious that it was drawn to his attention, or should have been drawn to his attention, in July 1987. If this document is correct it was drawn to his attention in July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Macklin accurately describes the simple, grammatical meaning of what the Minister said in this place and Senator Macklin has accurately set out the reasons why misleading the Parliament is extremely serious. The fact is that we cannot operate unless we can rely upon the honesty and the truth of what is put before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the standards which were imposed by the Whitlam Government. In the cases of both Cairns and Connor, Whitlam insisted that the standards be adhered to. In each case there are parallels with the situation in which Minister Hand finds himself. In the case of Dr Cairns, Dr Cairns at all times stressed that he had behaved in good faith. He may have been inept, but he behaved in good faith. At most, it would appear that he signed a letter without being conscious of its contents; something which I suppose one can say any busy Minister could do. The fact is that that led to the misleading of the House of Representatives and it led to Dr Cairns's dismissal, notwithstanding the fact that he totally protested his innocence. Mr Whitlam said this:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not regard these documents-</PARA>
<PARA>they are the documents in which Cairns set forth his innocence-</PARA>
<PARA>as satisfactory explanations of these two issues which I put to you and which with your consent I stated to the Press. Since you write that you do not intend to resign from any position you hold, I must advise the Governor-General to terminate your commission. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to those Australian Democrats who were unable to accept the argument of Senator Macklin yesterday that, just as Dr Cairns claimed-and it was not disputed by his Prime Minister-that he had innocently misled the House, so Mr Hand has misled this chamber and the same standards should apply. If one turned to the case of Minister Connor, one would find exactly the same situation applied. Mr Whitlam found that he had been led to mislead the House, because of the misinformation provided by Connor to him. In those circumstances, Connor had to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if one looks at the principles which are discussed extensively in a book entitled The Politics of Australian Democracy, written by Professor Emy of Monash University, one finds a very simple and clear statement that there is a convention that it is just not possible to tolerate a misleading of the House by a Minister. I do not think time will permit me to talk about that in any extensive way. But I do commend a study of that book to the Australian Democrats who, by their vote yesterday, showed an insufficient appreciation of that fundamental institutional fact. That book reports:</PARA>
<PARA>Whitlam thereby confirmed that the sanction of resignation was brought because of the minister's indiscretion in misleading parliament, not because of improper, illegal or corrupt conduct. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not necessary to suggest that there has been improper, illegal or corrupt conduct; it is only necessary that the Parliament should have been misled. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third leg of this censure motion, which relates to the failure of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be unfair to the Prime Minister to say that he has in no way interfered with the administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I think that most senators would recall the Prime Minister's foray in the Northern Territory last year. The Prime Minister chose to go to the Northern Territory and to make an unexpected, unresearched and damaging statement that he would enter into a treaty during the bicentennial year. It was an amazing thing that such a major announcement could be made in the way the Prime Minister did it. It was done in a way which was calculated to harm the Aboriginal people of Australia. The issue of a treaty has been around for a decade. It has been subject to considerable discussion. Nothing could be clearer than that it is an utterly divisive issue within the Australian community. Nothing could be clearer than that it would lead to the most solid objection and complaint from a substantial majority of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Hawke did, in a flamboyant, self-indulgent and destructive way, was to reopen a discussion without prior thought, a discussion which inevitably will lead nowhere. It is part of a pattern of failure which again requires longer than the period of this debate to document. It starts with the utter irresponsibility of Senator Susan Ryan, who, on behalf of the then Opposition, made those famous promises of national land rights which have never been delivered on. It was part of a purchasing of Aboriginal votes which was very successful. That promise was kept alive in a half-hearted way for 4 1/2 years, again to the continuing detriment of the Aboriginal people because of its divisiveness and because of the guarantee that in the end it would never be put into operation. I remind honourable senators that during the whole of that period it was within the legislative power of the Government to do that because it had the full-hearted support of the Australian Democrats. Senator Michael Macklin made that clear time and again. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern is to make promises, to raise expectations, to give rise to Aboriginals making unreasonable demands, and to causing, by that process, an outbreak of white resentment, which is described as the white backlash, and which is central to the sorry position of Aboriginal Australians during 1988. That is the pattern of administration in Aboriginal affairs-unfulfilled promises, unrealistic promises, a carelessness about basic administration, a raising of expectations, a raising of Aboriginal demands, and a steady deterioration of the attitudes of Australians generally to Aboriginal advancement programs. It is a disgraceful situation and I believe it is the greatest blot on the Hawke Labor Government. It is an example of unparalleled political cynicism and utter carelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> I have drawn the attention of senior Ministers in this Government to my concerns about maladministration of Aboriginal affairs almost from the first year of this Government being in office. I have found them uninterested in the mess which is developing under their administration. The Prime Minister has chosen to enter this debate only on occasions of theatre. He has let the Aboriginal people of Australia down. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate I do not need to document the failures of administration. Honourable senators should go to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, which is years old now. It documents the failures. They should look at the audit report that was just tabled where it shows that $1.2m was delivered for totally unsatisfactory performance by the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. And what confusion! I have been talking within the last two days to an honourable senator with a deep interest in Aboriginal affairs. He said to me, `But NAIHO has delivered very good services'. NAIHO has delivered nothing. The very good services have been delivered by many of the Aboriginal medical services funded under the previous Government and funded under this Government. NAIHO is not a service delivery organisation. It is a coordinating body. It is a body that was supposed to improve communications, a body which we find under the auditor's report did not bother to communicate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had nothing but failure and symbolism from this Government. In the long term, whilst the institutional interests of the Parliament in getting the truth are fundamentally important to the future of this country, I believe that nothing is more important than getting the administration of Aboriginal affairs on an orderly basis, on a basis which will give the next generation of Aboriginal people some hope. It is not possible to travel around Australia, it is not possible to visit the Aboriginal communities which are isolated, it is not possible to visit Aboriginal communities which are part of the towns and cities of this country, without getting continuous reports of disquiet about the administration of Aboriginal affairs under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times, the newspaper which is no doubt closest to the bureaucracy in Australia, carried an editorial with the headline `Why Hand must step down now'. That leading article talked about serious issues of ministerial accountability. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The real issue ought to be what the episode reveals about Mr Hand's administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that if anything is in the right place in Aboriginal Affairs today it is the Minister's heart. Everybody tells me his heart is in the right place, and I accept that. But that is the only thing that is in the right place. The Department has been estranged from the Minister. The Department has been ignored by the Minister. The Department has been put down by the Minister. Those members of the Aboriginal community who are not part of the favoured few, those who are favoured by the land councils, have been put down by the Minister. The Minister has spent a lot of time on the track and he has not listened to the Aboriginal people of Australia. I have never known such frequency of complaint from the people who are supposed to be being advantaged by the hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditure which is put forward by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area of total failure. It is an area of huge promise and huge failure. That is why we censure the Prime Minister. We censure the Prime Minister because he is ultimately responsible for his Government. He tolerated the nonsense under Minister Holding of 4 1/2 years of promises of national land rights. There is no serious observer of Aboriginal affairs in Australia who believes that that was a legal, constitutional, administrative or political possibility. It was a lie. This Prime Minister presided over the delivery of a lie to that community for 4 1/2 years under the previous Minister. Under this Minister he has promoted a last bit of symbolism which is going to cause more misery. </PARA>
<PARA> My final charge against the Prime Minister is that he has involved himself only when it has been of symbolic value to him. I think that is shameful. I contrast that with the attitude of the last Prime Minister who, right or wrong, tried to look to the interests of Aboriginal Australians on a consistent basis, indeed often to the detriment of his support among his own supporters in the community. He had a serious and consistent interest in the interests of Aboriginal Australians. Senator Peter Baume would know of this. I know of this as a former Minister. Viner knows of it. The contrast between Fraser and Hawke in this area is a really shameful one for Prime Minister Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Hawke has failed to live up to his responsibilities to ensure that his Ministers meet proper ministerial standards for this Parliament. He has at the same time failed the most vulnerable section of the Australian community. I have to say that I despise the record of the Labor Government in this area. I hope that this motion will be carried, and that we will see the end of this Minister and a more serious approach to the interests of disadvantaged Australians, and disadvantaged Aboriginal Australians in particular. </PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition's motion has three parts to it.

As to the last or `third leg', as Senator Chaney describes it, of the argument, it is not my purpose to get into a debate about a whole range of policy issues. However, I want to refer to one or two. In his remarks Senator Chaney encapsulated 100 years of history and mustered all of the moral indignation he could against this Government. But he cannot come in here and seriously say that the condition of the Aboriginal people was better, more optimistic or anything else at the end of the seven years of Fraser Government than it is now.

<PARA> There have been a number of achievements under this Government in respect of Aboriginal matters. Since 1984 the provision of basic essential services under the town campers assistance program has been extended to 135 towns. The percentage of Aboriginal students in secondary education has more than doubled. Almost 1,000 Aboriginals now hold post-secondary education awards. The median income of Aboriginal and Islander people has increased by almost 70 per cent. The infant mortality rate has been significantly reduced. These are some of the things which Senator Chaney, with his broad-brush approach, addressed as being disasters under this Government. I do not think they are in the light of those sorts of facts, which were not, of course, brought out in the debate by Senator Chaney. One would hardly expect him to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have again the National Party of Australia spokesman on everything except trade, Mr Sinclair, entering into the political debate on this issue. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Under a coalition Government, priority would be given to health, housing, education and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The record in the period of this Government on each of those issues in respect of Aboriginals is better than the record of the Fraser Government. Mr Sinclair went on:</PARA>
<PARA>These are the areas where you need to help Aborigines-</PARA>
<PARA>as if everybody did not know that-</PARA>
<PARA>and there is a particular responsibility the Australian people have given constitutionally to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to enter into today's debate, if I might call it that-the debate that has been going on for a week or two-when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The trouble is that not only are they going inequitably, Aborigines around Australia represented on that body-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>but they have forgotten about the basic requirements of the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>Some members of the coalition are trying to enter into a debate about the issue; others are trying to enter into a debate about Mr Hand; and Senator Chaney, to his credit I suppose, is trying to do everything at once. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Government senators will deal further with the Aboriginal issues which have been raised in this very broad-brush approach by Senator Chaney. In respect of the other points made by Senator Chaney, let me say that the standard of members of the Fraser Government in respect of ministerial responsibility was to sack their loyal colleague Senator Withers and not sack any National Party Ministers for anything, whatever they did.

<PARA> Senator Chaney raised three issues: one, close to his heart, the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio; another, an attack on the Prime Minister; and the third, the question of standards generally. The Prime Minister has not stood aside from the issue. He attaches a great deal of importance to ministerial integrity and regards seriously allegations of misleading Parliament made against any Minister. As I said in Question Time, it is no good going through the issues relating to John Brown or other people, as Senator Chaney has sought to do.

That is not the issue here. In spite of that, the Prime Minister has been very concerned about these issues, has spoken at length with Mr Hand and reviewed the relevant documents. On the question of whether a decision was made by Mr Hand on funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, the Prime Minister, after an examination of the facts, was satisfied that Mr Hand did not mislead Parliament in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many points could be made and have been made, not the least of which is that it is perfectly clear that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs knew that it should not move on this issue until authorised to do so by the Minister. As to the audit report, the Prime Minister, like all of us, on reflection believes there could have been greater precision in what was said in the Parliament, but the meaning and the intention of the words were clear enough. Semantic imprecision is not sufficient ground for calling for a resignation. As Senator Durack put it in 1979 when he was a Minister, `The Minister must have been shown to have had a guilty mind'. That is not something that could be said of Mr Hand. In spite of the Opposition's best efforts--</PARA>

<PARA> There is one thing that this Government is sure about: every time the Opposition raises a clamour, or the media promotes an issue as a result of an Opposition clamour, that does not involve a Minister resigning. The principle to which the Government adheres faithfully is not that Ministers resign over every perceived error or failure of administration, but that they answer for their actions publicly and particularly in the Parliament. </PARA>

But the question arises as to whether that is a reason for resignation. No amount of clamouring by the Opposition on the basis of what has been substantiated will lead to the resignation of Mr Hand, or to a request for his resignation, if one returns to the essential point of what was said in the statement of 8 September and its relationship with what happened in July last year and on 31 October.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first leg, as Senator Chaney puts it, of his censure motion relates to the failure of the Prime Minister to uphold proper standards of ministerial propriety. That paragraph refers to the misleading, so-called, which has been debated in this Parliament for about three or four days. Interestingly enough, a contrast is drawn with the standards adhered to by John Brown, who resigned because he misled parliament. As I pointed out, the circumstances then were considerably different from the circumstances with which the Government and the Prime Minister are confronted now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That shows how much Senator Stone knows. Mr Brown's statement was also a prepared statement, so Senator Stone should not start drawing that dichotomy on the basis of ignorance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second leg of the argument relates to the failure to uphold even the principles concerning the misleading of parliament applied by the Whitlam Government. We could have one of those debates that go on all afternoon about what Whitlam did and what Fraser did in relation to ministerial responsibility. On each side of the House we can draw comfort from things said by prime ministers of the day, and in certain circumstances we can draw discomfort. I see no merit in continuing that part of the debate because it is just an historical exercise which wastes time and involves beating the air and moral posturing. I do not see much point in continuing that exercise in the Senate after this issue has been exposed for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point which is central to the argument: the question of what Mr Hand meant by his statement relating to the first sighting of this document. That has been dealt with in hours of debate. I do not propose to pursue that issue further, except to say that within that statement there is a clear ambiguity. It is open to different interpretations. The Opposition takes one interpretation; the Government takes another. Trying to answer that question in the adversarial forum which the Senate constitutes on a matter of this kind is like dealing with angels on the head of a pin. The Government rejects this censure motion, and in the course of subsequent speeches the reason for that will be further elaborated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate today is a motion of censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in three parts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) his failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility in relation to the misleading of parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (b) his failure to uphold even the principles concerning the misleading of parliament applied by the Whitlam government</PARA>
<PARA> (c) and his failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I was telephoned early this morning by a person from a radio station who wanted a comment from me with regard to the vote of the Senate yesterday on a motion with regard to the misleading of the House of Representatives or the Senate-it could have been both in terms of the way that the motion was drafted-by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), a motion that I supported yesterday. My response to that person was that the vote of the Senate had been lost and that there could not be seen in any way, shape of form to be any obligation on the Prime Minister with regard to that lost vote. I had supported it, but it had been lost. I had been on the losing side and, as happens so many times, unfortunately, in this place, if one does not win one must move on to the next issue. It seems though that the Opposition has no intention of moving on to the next issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has decided the first part. I do not see there being a situation in which the votes that honourable senators cast yesterday are likely to change unless new information is brought before the Parliament in this or some other subsequent debate. There has not been any today, but there may be some in future. On that basis I do not think one could support the first part of the censure motion, because the Senate obviously has far more important things to do with its time than reiterate an exercise without any new information. </PARA>
<PARA> I looked at the Notice Paper and saw that it has 67 Bills on it, some of which I consider-I do not know whether other honourable senators do-to be of vital and overwhelming importance to this country not only in 1988 but in years to come. One in particular which the Opposition is interested in burying is the Higher Education Funding Bill. It is a Bill which I consider to be of vital importance, and I consider its defeat to be of vital importance to the educational future of all Australians. On looking through the Notice Paper I notice the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill, the Bounty and Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill-that concerns our trading position which is also vital to the economic health of this country-and the National Crimes Authority Amendment Bill, which relates to the controlling of crime in South Australia. The list goes on. They are items which I consider to be of vital importance and to which I hope the Senate will be able to devote a fair amount of its time. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the first part of the censure motion is a reiteration of yesterday's motion, it could not be supported. With regard to part (b), that is simply irrelevant, not only to the debate today but probably to the debate of yesterday and certainly to any debate in the future. Part (c) is a totally different matter. The censure here relates to the failure of the Prime Minister `to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians'. I would like to confine my remarks to that particular section since I think sections (a) and (b) are not relevant and should not consume any more time of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The last part is a very important issue. It is an issue that has concerned the Australian Democrats for a long time, not only since 1983 when the Hawke Labor Government came to power but before that. My views on that matter, as the spokesperson for my Party, and Senator Coulter's views as the current spokesperson for our Party, are very well known to people in the Senate. I do not intend to reiterate all of those views in this debate. We have, in the past, under Liberal-National Party governments and under this Government, been appalled at the treatment of Aboriginal people in this country. We are appalled that people want to continue to press a paternalistic attitude. We are appalled that people will not recognise the rights of Aboriginal people to land and to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> We are appalled that we have had so many votes in this chamber opposing the legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal people. For example, when that extraordinary symbol to the people, Uluru, was being debated in this chamber-a Bill was introduced by the Labor Government to return the rightful ownership of Uluru to the Aboriginal people-it was opposed by the Opposition parties. Even when we get down to insignificant things, such as the small parcel of land in Wreck Bay in Jervis Bay Territory, we still have an extraordinary debate in this place. When there was an attempt in this chamber, prompted by the combined churches of Australia, to carry a motion-it would have been the first such motion in this chamber, an historic event, and hopefully, a motion that everybody could have agreed to-to support the legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal people, even when the motion was watered down in such a way that the Opposition parties would be enticed to give it unanimous support, so that I could hardly end up supporting it, they still opposed it. I think the Opposition's attitude with regard to Aboriginal affairs and, if it ever gets into government, its attempt to implement its policy, will be to the lasting detriment of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not find the current Government's exercise very much better. Certainly, in terms of orderly and proper administration, as is set out in this motion there has not been any. So many opportunities have been lost in the last five years of Labor Party administration with regard to Aboriginal people. When the Labor Party came into government it had quite an extensive policy. It was based, correctly in our view, on the fundamental view of the Aboriginal people that all else stems from their attitude to the land and that their ownership of the land is fundamental to their future. It is not a simplistic view that they take; it is a very complex view. But it is one which people have been tempted to put aside by attitudes which tend to be massively paternalistic: for example, that we ought to concentrate on health, on education or on some other matter. We know what that means in fact. It means denying the legitimate rights of Aboriginal people in this country to their land. It is from their land that will stem their health, their education, their culture and their future. That is a view that my Party has taken since it was founded. It is a view that we intend to continue to push. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a view which is shared by the Opposition or the Australian Labor Party but it is a view which we believe ultimately will occur in this country. If it does not occur, the white problem of Aboriginals will continue. It is not an Aboriginal problem; it is a white problem. It is a white problem not to be able to come to grips with the legitimate aspirations of the original inhabitants of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to censure the Opposition, which we would dearly love to do in terms of its recently enunciated policy. We are confined to deciding whether we wish to censure the Prime Minister with regard to the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. In terms of what I have just said, fairly obviously we do. We would also like to encompass a censure of the Opposition, but we know that neither the Opposition nor the Government would support such a motion. It certainly pains us that the vast amount of time that has been spent on this matter regarding the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been drawn away from the time that should be spent on real issues-time that has not been devoted to legitimate aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I sit down I want to say that some of what the Labor Party Government has done in the Aboriginal area has been wholeheartedly supported and has been long overdue. These things were never undertaken by the Fraser Administration in the seven long years that Senator Chaney referred to as a compassionate period for the Aboriginal people. They did not occur during the Fraser Government; they occurred during the Hawke Labor Government administration. As a matter of history, those things will be able to be pointed out. However, probably the only exercise in which we really got onto the statute book a major piece of legislative work with regard to land rights occurred during the Fraser Administration, although admittedly it was at the initiative of the Whitlam Government; in fact, the legislation had been introduced by the Whitlam Government before it was destroyed on 11 November 1975. The exercise that the Fraser Government continued with, to its credit, was to undertake and put in place a piece of land rights legislation that was the envy of many other countries around the world that have had to confront the same types of situations. I know from many discussions I have had with lawyers working on native rights in Canada, for example, that they drew an enormous amount of inspiration from that piece of legislation introduced by the Fraser Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some good things done over time. I suppose that is because in all of the governments there have been people who have been working away at what they believe to be the correct policies, despite the fact that the overall policy of those governments has been horrific. There have been people in the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party who in their heart of hearts know what has to be done and have attempted to work towards that. Unfortunately, any judgment made in this area would have to be that the pace of progress has been infinitesimal, has been slow, and has had so many setbacks that the Aboriginal people have a right to be dispirited. The Aboriginal people have a history of 200 years of suffering-a history which, in terms of the numbers, has been the most massive holocaust of any people anywhere in the world. It has been a period when they have suffered in ways in which no other native community has ever had to suffer. It has been a period of slavery, never acknowledged--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that we are addressing today is a censure motion by Senator Chaney of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It reflects on the standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility; it reflects on the failure of the Prime Minister to uphold the principles concerning the misleading of Parliament; and it centres on the failure to ensure an orderly and proper administration of a particular portfolio. What are really at stake here today, very desperately, are the real needs of Aboriginal people. It is a tragedy that the 80,000 people who live in the traditional Aboriginal communities of Australia, because of the policies of this Government, have problems in the area of literacy and education; in fact, it is quite openly proven that in those areas things are regressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The health care of Aboriginal people is in a shambles and, in trying to secure decent and proper employment, things are stalled. The participation and involvement of Aboriginal people from traditional communities in the leadership of their communities has been nobbled. In the urban communities of Australia there are some 150,000 Aboriginal people who, by the action of this Government, have been caught up in power games and political struggles. We have seen emerging in recent years, under the influence more particularly of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in recent events, cliques of radicals who are seeking to exercise the management authority in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In replying to Senator Chaney, Senator Button attempted to draw a difference between the Fraser Government and the Hawke Government. He implied that some of us did not have the credentials that could stack up. I would be happy to stack my credentials any day against those of Minister Hand or Senator Button, because I believe that my colleague Senator Collins from the Northern Territory and I are the only two people in this place who can claim to be related through marriage to Aborigines. A large number of my personal friends in the Northern Territory are Aborigines, just as I hope Senator Collins's are. Some 35,000 people, or 25 per cent, of the electorate that Senator Collins and I share are Aborigines. Those people certainly talk to Senator Collins and me; they are not here talking frequently to Senator Button or to Mr Hand. Senator Button referred to the semantic indecision of the Minister, Mr Hand. That should read `the semantic imprecision'. Senator Button referred to an article in yesterday's Melbourne Herald in which I am quoted as saying-I do not walk away from it:</PARA>
<PARA>If we don't get him-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Hand-</PARA>
<PARA>on the issue of misleading Parliament, we'll get him on others. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last six weeks there have been many other matters before this place on which the Minister ought to have resigned. They just keep falling out; they keep dropping; they keep coming. It is because of his rotten, lousy administration. If it does not happen today, it will certainly happen tomorrow or next week or when we come back in February because there are so many occasions when these things happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to today's media and the important feature writers and editorials and the way this event has been picked up in the last couple of days. In the Australian today Paul Kelly says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hand statement to Parliament-that the audit report had only been drawn to his attention of late-should be seen for what it is: a pathetic excuse to ease the heat on himself, a clear act of disloyalty to his department, and a statement that was plain wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>Today's Canberra Times, under an editorial headed `Why Hand must step down now', commences:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, has been in serious trouble with his portfolio for many weeks, and his political future looks bleak. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Hand ministerial style has been strangely reminiscent of the style of Gordon Bryant, and may face the same consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>How true. But the censure motion we are today addressing relates to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the fact that he has looked on and done nothing about the scandals and the ineptitude. What about the political process of which he is meant to be the leader? The leader of the Australian nation should ensure that this Parliament operates properly and effectively. When should a Minister resign? Let me quote from the article entitled The Politics of Australian Democracy that Senator Chaney referred to earlier:</PARA>
<PARA> Responsible government requires a high standard of integrity. The ancient maxim that those who rule others should first be able to rule themselves is still relevant. Those entrusted with public office need to be excessively scrupulous in their public behaviour because public contempt for an individual minister may easily produce contempt for his authority and office. </PARA>
<PARA>A further quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Resignation is still a valid sanction where ministers have been indiscreet or arbitrary in exercising power. In cases where the minister has misled parliament, condoned or authorised a blatantly unreasonable use of executive power, or more vaguely, where the minister's behaviour contravenes established standards of morality, resignation or dismissal is the appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Where a minister's judgment, discretion or conduct are impugned, he may resign not merely as an admission of guilt, but in order that his fault (or alleged fault) does not endanger the integrity of the Government as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In a case of ministerial misconduct, there is more to be lost by trying to explain it away. Requiring the minister to resign is a symbolic act by which the Government is able to dissociate itself publicly from the misconduct in question. The public usually expect such dissociation from the Government. The Government usually looks to the Minister to tender his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney referred to the instances of Cairns and Connor in the Whitlam Administration. That was terribly important. John Brown, when he was forced to resign last year, in his letter of resignation said:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of my respect for the institution of Parliament, I feel that I have no alternative in all circumstances but to resign as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>More importantly, on 27 October 1988-last month-what did the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, say? This highlights the hypocrisy of the standard the Prime Minister has applied to the Hand affair. On 27 October the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ministers must, of course, continue to be answerable to the parliament and to take any necessary corrective action. But the truth is that there is no requirement for them to resign except where a significant act or omission was theirs, or was taken at their personal direction, or was a matter about which they obviously should have known, and done something. </PARA>
<PARA>Our Governor-General designate, Bill Hayden, on 28 April 1982 said:</PARA>
<PARA>No minister should believe that he or she can flout the spirit if not the letter of the law as well as the high standards of propriety demanded of public office. </PARA>
<PARA>They are all quotes that should be read and studied intimately and quickly by Minister Hand. He has no alternative but to resign and the Prime Minister has no alternative but to sack him. What have we seen today with regard to Mr Hand and the detriment he is causing to Aboriginal Australians? He is obviously the Minister who does not know anything. If ever anything was noted and put before him, it was certainly not understood. If ever anything was written to him, it was filed and ignored; it was obviously not studied and acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> In this place in the last month or so we have seen the examples of the Charleville Housing Cooperative with the Minister's mate, Sugar Ray Robinson. It was a matter of audit; a matter of involvement of the Ombudsman. We have seen the matters of Nardoola and the Oasis Hotel in New South Wales, where special Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) deals and negotiations were carried on by the Minister as he went around and discussed those areas. We have seen the matter of the Middar dance company of Western Australia, where Minister Hand exercised undue influence on the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and attempted to bypass the normal procedures of office. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last week we have concentrated on the supposed restructuring of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO). In all of the evidence put before us in this last week there has not been one bit of paper about the restructuring that is supposed to have been in place since January this year. We have seen what has been going on. Very obviously, the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, attempted to clear out the crooks from that organisation. What have we seen in this restructuring? We have seen Mr Hand attempting to find ways to put them back on the payroll. </PARA>
<PARA> Since May this year, when the Aboriginal Development Commission was restructured-or should I say perestroikaed-by the Minister by putting his mate into the Commission, we have seen nothing but a complex and very suspicious board operating with all sorts of hidden agendas, without proper authority, without answering to the Minister, and obviously with backroom deals being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in this place Senator Tate tabled an apology from the Acting General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission with regard to legal opinions for Tranby College. Let me remind the Senate that the essential issue around Tranby College is not this series of legal opinions but rather the allocation of some $500,000 of taxpayers' money to promote the Aboriginal treaty. That was initiated by Mr Hand at the Barunga festival in the middle of this year, when he put a ring in the nose of the Prime Minister, led him around the events, made a commitment and then came back. We saw one of the new commissioners of the ADC, Pat Dodson, march off to the next meeting of the ADC and demand and get $500,000 for Tranby College. At that stage there was no paperwork, no consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> We now see a litany of change of legal opinions in these legal documents that were tabled yesterday. The most concerning thing I find in them is that they were done again without the Minister's authority or without the authority of the Commission. They were instituted by the Deputy Chairman, Pat Dodson, the mate of the Minister. Mr Dodson bypassed the Commission and got his mate Michael Stewart on the staff of the Commission so he could keep in touch with his contacts. The Chairman of the ADC, Mrs McPherson, was completely bypassed-as was everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> A free for favour legal opinion by a Queen's Counsel has been called into question by the principal legal officers of the ADC. Senator Tate has been forced to eat humble pie, because he came back here yesterday and apologised to the Senate for misleading it and for putting information through this place in such an unusual way. The fact that Tranby College had that half a million dollars allocated to it by such unconventional means, and by mates of the Minister, should tell the Prime Minister something about the way in which this whole Department is being administered. The Hand administration has involved nothing but by-passing the Department. A series of events indicate that Hand himself is forever by-passing the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the Senate to the Budget Estimates for this year that were looked at by Senate Estimates committees. The former Minister, Mr Holding, allocated $460,000 in the financial year 1986-87 under the special financial program for the engagement of consultants. What do we have this financial year under Mr Hand? We have an allocation of $1.8m to engage consultants-a 300 per cent increase. This has nothing to do with the other Budget allocations of the normal national consultative program or the promotion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; it results from the way in which Minister Hand has bypassed and insulted the mechanisms available to him within the bureaucracy of his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, what about his relationship with the land council network? He has used the land councils in the Northern Territory-the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council-as his policy unit. Perhaps I should say he has used these councils and their staffs as an alternative Public Service-as a shadowing Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He has relied totally on the many people in that area linked to him. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs has posed a number of questions recently about the Minister's movement around the country when he was promoting ATSIC. I quote one of those questions:</PARA>
<PARA>Did any of those approaches result in Ministerial or Departmental decisions, or commitments, to increase funding beyond what had been budgeted or committed up to the time the approach was made? If so, what was the community, the approach, the decision and the amount involved in each case?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer tabled by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is horrifying. Of 93 approaches-approaches made while the Minister was out doing something political-involving additional or new funding, 21 have subsequently resulted in additional or new funds being granted after the projects were subjected to the Department's established process for appraisal and funding. These are set out in a schedule. So 21 additional jobs have been favoured by Minister Hand as he marched around the country trying to sell ATSIC to his mates. How much did he give? He dipped into the bin for this financial year to the tune of $457,536. He has precommitted for next financial year $239,683, and for the year after that he has precommitted $110,780. So the Minister has made a budgeting commitment of $800,000. It is no wonder that the Canberra Times editorial drew comparisons between Minister Hand and Gordon Bryant, because Bryant also had the same philosophy of walking around the country with a chequebook in his hand and passing out the dough as he went. Minister Hand has done nothing but demonstrate that the Labor Government is indulging in chequebook, on the run policy making. If the Prime Minister is condoning this form of administration, I believe he is adopting a totally wrong attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many instances where Hand has not acted as the Minister but as a mate. He acts as a mate to anyone who will scratch his back. What is his job at the moment? What is he looking at? Senator Button said that we are going to throw a few more things at Minister Hand in the coming week. I hope we do. But if Mr Hand remains Minister, the Prime Minister has to recognise that Gerry Hand will be the Minister for coordinating inquiries. He has in place seven major inquiries now, four of which are within the Public Service. The Prime Minister has put in place inquiries by the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner, the Department of Finance and a Mr Menzies to back him up. They are all going to report in February or March. If honourable senators think these debates are light on, they can just wait until those reports come in and Hand is sitting in the dock. We will go through all this again if he is still in office. How stupid of the Prime Minister. There are also three parliamentary inquiries in place. We have the select committee of this Senate as well as the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Hand is involved in every one. </PARA>

There are at least six, maybe seven, that I can count. He has put in place a special review of arts and craft. Senator Puplick asked a question in this chamber today about that inquiry because the Minister has put somebody on that review committee with very suspicious credentials, somebody who has been flogging off Australia's collection of Aboriginal art. Minister Tate did not address that. Mr Hand has that person acting as a special adviser. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Aboriginal health strategy working party will not report until some time next year. Yet behind its back Gerry Hand is running around trying to do some special deal for NAIHO. Last January the Minister told that organisation that he would not be able to help it until this new strategy working party provides some information. What a way to administer. It is total incompetence. He has commenced the Bonner review into the Pitjantjatjara areas of northern South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and he has the review of Aboriginal independent schools, the review of Commonwealth-State funding and the special interdepartmental committee on the Torres Strait Islands. All of these reviews have been instituted on Minister Hand's initiative. So he is the coordinator of inquiries. By my count there are 13 inquiries at least and there are probably a lot more that we do not know about in the Department and the ADC. How the heck can he be a competent Minister when he is running around with all of these reviews that have either been put on him by the Prime Minister or that he has initiated himself?</PARA>
<PARA> Hand's style of administration needs to be called into question. He certainly has divided the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC. He has done nothing but destroy morale and tear these organisations apart since he has been Minister. We need to be reminded that he has dismissed 10 senior, prominent, involved Aboriginal people; chucked them out of office because they dared to put up an alternative view to his. He chucked out eight commissioners of the ADC last May. He sacked Perkins over some trumped up charge concerning the Woden Town Club and he has replaced one of the deputy secretaries of the Department, Rob Winroe, by shuffling the pack and putting Winroe further down than what was expected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has the Minister done to O'Brien and Shirley McPherson? How have they been dealt with in the ADC? I agree with Senator Boswell. Minister Hand has not got involved in the proper exercising of ministerial responsibility. He is an insult to the good, sound staff of the Department and the ADC-the 95 per cent of the staff of those authorities who are seeking to get on with their jobs and who do a good job. There are many fine Aboriginal leaders in that group who have emerged to responsibility, but because of the way in which this Minister has stuffed up the administration of his Department he has put all their careers and their futures totally at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need only look at what is currently happening in the ADC. Today I asked questions about whether there would be any form of Public Service restructuring in the next week or so. I certainly hope that there will not be. I was made aware that there had been various discussions with unions in this area very recently. But the fact is that, in the last couple of months, 10 senior officers of the ADC have either resigned, have been pushed out, or are contemplating alternative employment. They have been stripped off from the top. How can we relate to that with any confidence?</PARA>
<PARA> We would love to know what is happening in the senior echelons of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, either in Canberra or in the regional offices. The way in which many senior officers have been treated is an insult to them. It is the Minister who is devoid of skills; not the people in the Public Service or the commissioners of the ADC. It is the Minister who is forcing so many of these people to quit. I wish to quote from an article in today's Canberra Times which referred to the remarks of Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Senator John Coulter, said he thought Mr Hand was getting into trouble because he had surrounded himself with a group of advisers and `yes' men who had played down some information. </PARA>
<PARA>We also find in the Canberra Times this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Hand's acknowledged ALP left-wing credentials ensured he had a long-standing relationship with many of the more influential Aboriginal lobby groups and not necessarily those aligned with Mr Perkins. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has surrounded himself with sycophants and fools. That is the way in which he is seeking to administer his Department. If the Prime Minister does not take this into account, he need only look at the Minister's personal staff. Whilst I know that it is the prerogative of any Minister to recruit to his staff people with political sympathies and loyalties on which he can rely, at the same time he should always be mindful of the qualities of those ministerial officers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note in looking at the Minister's staff list in the telephone directory that at the moment there is a great black line through the name Jackamos. Jackamos was the Secretary of the Woden Town Club who supposedly did not tell the Minister about the degree of funding in that case. A number of others in the Minister's office are Australian Labor Party apparatchiks but some of them have held particularly operative positions in the ALP Left, and that is where they ought to be-back in the branch divisions, back in Melbourne. What about Neil Andrews, a principal private secretary-former lawyer of the Central Land Council? He was the guy who wrote the letter to the staff of Senator Reynolds earlier this year which was a conspiracy against the Northern Territory Government. It was shameful. What about Rob Riley, who is linked with the Tranby College event and the national coalition of Aboriginal organisations-a mate of Pat Dodson and a mate of all the other lefties who are linked to Minister Hand? He was Chairman of the National Aboriginal Conference prior to its liquidation, which cost many millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. What about Harriet Swift, who also goes under the name Valerie Binns? She is a very strong Labor Party- person-the lady who threw eggs at Governor-General Kerr. These are important criteria that the Prime Minister should be looking at. He should be looking at the way in which Hand is seeking to run his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The censure motion by Senator Chaney stands on its merits. This Senate must censure the Prime Minister for his failure to uphold standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility. It must censure him for his failure to uphold the principles concerning the misleading of parliament and it must censure him for his failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the Department and the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a very important motion-at least, important in the forms of the Senate, though whether if deserves the importance that has been attached to it this afternoon I guess is a matter which will be finally judged by the Senate within the hour. The motion is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures the Prime Minister for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) his failure to uphold proper standards of ministerial propriety and responsibility in relation to the misleading of parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in contrast with the standards adhered to by the Hon. John Brown who resigned because he misled parliament</PARA>
<PARA> (b) his failure to uphold even the principles concerning the misleading of parliament applied by the Whitlam government and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>When one reads that motion one has a sense of deja vu, certainly in relation to the first two parts because they speak of a misleading of the Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). One is immediately aware that only yesterday this chamber had before it a motion in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Prime Minister to dismiss the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of his misleading of Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation and the subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted public service procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have in relation to two-thirds of this motion of censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is a reliance on a misleading of the Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, which assertion has already been dealt with by this chamber in the last 24 hours, when, having the evidence before it, it rejected that assertion. That is the key point. Indeed standing order 133-Madam Acting Deputy President, I have no intention whatsoever of asking you to rule in relation to it-states:</PARA>
<PARA>No Question or Amendment shall be proposed which is the same in substance as any Question or Amendment which, during the same Session, has been resolved in the affirmative or negative . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Unless, or course, it has been rescinded. As I have said, in relation to at least two-thirds of this motion we are dealing with matters which have already been voted on. The question of the misleading of the Parliament by the Hon. Gerry Hand has already been dealt with. If one looks at page 3597 of the Hansard record dated 6 December 1988 one finds at the end of the debate on the urgency motion put in this chamber and signed by Fred Chaney, senator for the State of Western Australia yesterday, this final paragraph of Senator Chaney's reply to the debate:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is conclusive. I commend the motion to the Senate, and I trust that this motion will be a lesson to the Government that the Parliament is entitled to accurate information from its Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>The questions was put that Senator Chaney's motion be agreed to, the Senate divided, and the question was resolved in the negative. Despite the fact that the Opposition asserted yesterday that the matter was conclusive, and despite the fact that the Opposition wanted to teach the Government a lesson in relation to the purported misleading of the Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Senate, having deliberated on the matter, having considered all the points that were put, having listened to all the evidence that was paraded and having accorded it the proper weight and value, resolved the question in the negative and thereby decided that there was no need for the Prime Minister to dismiss the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs because of his alleged misleading of Parliament over the question of funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and the subsequent attempts to falsify the record in defiance of all accepted Public Service procedures. We have a very curious situation, at least in terms of what the ordinary, impartial observer outside this place would think. The matter dealt with yesterday in a vote of this place, which resolved in the negative the particular charge which is the central part of two-thirds of this motion has been revived. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, if the motion had been put in exactly the same terms as it was yesterday, standing order 133 would have been invoked, and it would have been ruled out of order. But because Senator Chaney has changed a word here or there and added a new element, namely, the supposed failure of the Prime Minister to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians, this matter can stand as a matter that is properly before this chamber. But, as I say, the substance of it has already been dealt with. There has been no new evidence whatsoever brought into the chamber concerning the supposed misleading of Parliament by Mr Hand. It is a very tired re-run of matters which were exhaustively dealt with yesterday. There is not one jot, not one tittle of new information that has been brought into the chamber which would persuade any person who voted against the motion yesterday, to change his mind. What was repudiated yesterday, I am obviously suggesting, deserves to be repudiated today. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Mr Hand did not mislead the Senate in relation to the decision as to the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. I believe the auditor's report has been fully dealt with and, as I said, was the subject of considerable debate yesterday. One has to ask: Why, given all this, would the Prime Minister not deal with a Minister who he formed the view had misled the Parliament? That is really the charge that is being laid against the Prime Minister. The Opposition says, `Mr Hand is under the protective mantle of the Prime Minister because he is from the left wing of the Party'. I have never heard such an improbable, implausible, baseless assertion for the throwing of the mantle of protection across a Minister by the Prime Minister. It is absurd. It is a reflection on the Prime Minister's integrity in relation to the standards which he demands of his Ministers. Of course, I absolutely reject that assertion. Anybody who knows anything about politics in Australia, particularly within the Labor Party, would know that that is inherently improbable. For the Opposition to give that feeble and only explanation for the protection of the Minister is beyond any credence whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The alleged misleading of the Parliament by the Minister has not been made out and there is no need for the Prime Minister to undertake the steps which have been asked of him. Therefore, he has not failed to uphold proper standards of ministerial responsibility. As we all know, the Prime Minister attaches the highest importance to ministerial integrity and regards allegations, such as this, made against a Minister very seriously. He has spoken at length with Mr Hand and he has reviewed relevant documents. The Prime Minister, after examination of the facts relating to whether a decision had been made by Mr Hand on NAIHO funding, is satisfied that Mr Hand did not mislead the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Many points could be made, not least that it is perfectly clear that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs knew that it should not move on funding until it was authorised in writing. As for the audit report, the Prime Minister like the Minister believes there could, on reflection, have been greater precision in what was said in the Parliament, but the meaning and the intention of the words were clear. Semantic imprecision is not sufficient ground for calling for a resignation. From all he knows at present, the Prime Minister retains full confidence in the Minister and his integrity. I believe that that is a proper statement of the Prime Minister's responsibilities. It indicates that he has undertaken them with the thoroughness and care that one would expect, and that he has come to what is a defensible conclusion-defensible in terms of the facts and evidence as we know them and as the Senate chamber itself judged them only yesterday. I repeat-and it is the key point-that only yesterday the Senate, in possession of the same evidence, came to the conclusion that there had been no misleading of the Senate or of the other place by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. So the first two key parts of the motion we have before us purporting to censure the Prime Minister fall to the ground. That leaves the claim that the Prime Minister has failed to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you would agree, Mr Deputy President, that if one were making a contribution to a charity over the Christmas period in order to provide relief for the homeless or the destitute, either overseas or in Australia, and one was presented with the fact that one of the charities one was thinking of contributing to had 11 per cent of its money spent on administration and another had 8.46 per cent spent on administration, one would be inclined to choose that which provided more funds for the actual delivering of programs rather than that which provided more funds on the administration of the charitable agency concerned. I would have thought that it is quite clear that the constant claims we hear from Senator Chaney, that somehow his administration of the Department was in all respects better in delivering services to the Aboriginal people than is the case under the Government and under this particular Minister, fall to the ground when one sees a very simple table such as the one I referred to. It makes it quite clear that the stringencies which have been applied to the administration of the Department have ensured that a greater proportion of the moneys allocated and appropriated by this Government are finding their way to the provision of services for the Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is always very wrong to generalise. I would not claim that the present delivery of services to the Aboriginal people throughout Australia and their advancement is perfect, and I would not say that everything that Senator Chaney did when he was Minister was deficient, but I believe there has to be a balanced approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I could give many examples where the living standards and the situation of Aboriginal people have been considerably advanced under programs funded by this Government and which are part of the policy direction of this Government. For example, since 1984, the provision of basic essential services under the town campers assistance program has extended to 135 town camps. Since 1981, the percentage of Aboriginal students in secondary education has more than doubled. That is good not only for the individual students concerned, but, obviously, for the Australian community as a whole. For example, I know from our sustained efforts in Tasmania that the percentage of students going on to secondary education and going on to tertiary studies has steadily been increasing over the last three or four years in a way which is magnificent because participation in education is one way, almost a sure way but certainly a very important way, in which individuals can be lifted out of a fatalistic frame of mind where their horizons, their job opportunities, their opportunity to participate fully in the affairs of the country and sheer pleasures of culture that might be offered are severely hampered if they do not have a certain educational standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost 1,000 Aboriginal and Islander people now hold post-secondary awards, which is a considerable advance. The median income of Aboriginal and Islander people has increased by almost 70 per cent during this Government's administration. The Aboriginal infant mortality rate is still very high, and a great tragedy. Nevertheless it has been significantly reduced in areas such as the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The number of Aboriginal controlled medical services has almost tripled in the life of this Government. When one considers those achievements and others one sees that it is not correct to condemn, in a blanket way, the programs that have been undertaken under the administration of various Ministers in this Government, and particularly under the vigorous and concerned administration of the present Minister, Mr Gerry Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the motion before the chamber, the only new element, not dealt with yesterday-as I say, these matters were disposed of, repudiated and rejected by the Senate yesterday-is the claim that the Prime Minister has failed to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. The clear evidence of the last several months, when this matter erupted as a matter of parliamentary concern, has indicated that the Prime Minister has taken all the steps one would expect to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in so far as certain allegations and issues concerning that administration need to be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the case, in all this, that the Prime Minister is making an assumption which would lend any weight or colour to the sorts of claims that are made-extravagant claims, I believe-by Senator Chaney, Senator Tambling, Senator Short and others. But, given the various allegations and assertions that have been made, a speedy and comprehensive method of ensuring that things were on the right track was required. It was for that reason that the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, agreed that the Auditor-General should examine the financial administration of the Aboriginal Development Commission and of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and that the Public Service Commissioner should inquire into and report on matters relating to the staffing of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In addition, the Department of Finance has been called in to lend its special expertise to the rigorous examination of the procedures of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be emphasised that both the Public Service Commissioner and the Auditor-General are independent statutory officers. They have not been restricted by narrow terms of reference. They have been sent in to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio. Mr Andrew Menzies has been appointed to deal, after the investigation of the other officers has been completed, with allegations which do not fall within the appropriate statutory functions of those officers. Mr Menzies will exercise an independent judgment in his role in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> So one has a clear indication that the Prime Minister has exercised his fullest responsibility in so far as-obviously-he has not displaced, nor did he need to, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the responsibilities he has accepted and is undertaking in relation to the administration of his port- folio. Together with the Minister, he has ensured that those steps have been taken to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio, or at least to ensure that the public can be satisfied that orderly and proper administration is being undertaken in the face of the series of propagandist, misleading and generalised slurs on the provision of services to Aboriginal people which have fallen from the lips of so many honourable senators opposite, none more so than Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling has shown an extraordinary blood lust-that is the only way to describe it-in relation to this matter as he seeks to get from one motion or another, or one committee or another, the scalp of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Only a few minutes ago he stood up and quite shamelessly admitted what he had been reported as saying in yesterday's press-that if he did not get Mr Hand by one method he would get him by another. That stands to his discredit. He seemed to revel in the idea that he was heading some sort of posse which was after the Minister. He also did grave discredit to himself by, in the last part of his remarks this afternoon, not only trying to get the scalp of the Minister but also bringing in a list of the Minister's staff, going through it and casting an unjustifiable slur on their integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion before the chamber ought to be rejected for two reasons. As I have said, the Senate dealt yesterday with the substance of the question of whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had misled the Parliament. It resolved yesterday that he had not done so in a way which deserved the intervention of the Prime Minister. To bring the matter before the chamber again today only just fails to be out of order in accordance with standing order 133. It puts itself in order with the addition of the claim that the Prime Minister has not tried to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio. I have demonstrated that the Prime Minister has intervened where it has been required in order to give to the public a sense of confidence that all matters which have been the subject of allegation will be properly inquired into. They will be, and I am sure that the result will be to strengthen the proper administration of the portfolio by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>The Senate has just heard from the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate. My summary of what Senator Tate has said would be along the lines that, in Senator Tate's view, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has full confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, and in Mr Hand's administration of his Department. I lean across the chamber to ask Senator Tate to confirm that in his view the Prime Minister has full confidence in Mr Hand and in Mr Hand's administration of the Department. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate is not able to confirm it. That is exactly what I thought. Although Senator Tate had the audacity to imply all the way through his speech that the Prime Minister has full confidence in Mr Hand and in his administration of his Department, Senator Tate knows, as all of us in the chamber know, that Mr Hand is right on the borderline of being dismissed by the Prime Minister if he does not resign. Senator Tate kept saying things about the Prime Minister's confidence in Mr Hand but, when I challenged him, he did not have the courage to say `Yes, that is right. The Prime Minister has full confidence in Mr Hand and in his administration of his Department'. His response to me was, `I think it is disorderly to interject'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is generally accepted in Canberra at present that Minister Hand has misled the Parliament. By `generally accepted' I mean accepted on both sides of this chamber, for starters. In other words, it is generally accepted amongst senators, whether they are Labor Party, Liberal Party or National Party senators, and even by three Australian Democrat senators, I believe, who know in their heart of hearts, that Minister Hand has misled the Parliament. It does not matter what they say in the debate, it does not matter how they vote on particular matters; it is generally accepted in this place that Minister Hand misled the Parliament. Not only is it generally accepted in this chamber, it is also generally accepted by the fourth estate, that is, the media. It is also certainly and widely accepted by those in the Public Service in Canberra, who follow these matters. They know that Minister Hand has misled the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people around the corridors of this place are expressing some sympathy for Minister Hand. Apparently they are of the view that it is a difficult portfolio and that his heart is in the right place. I might add that I do not recall much sympathy for my colleagues Fred Chaney and Peter Baume when they held the portfolio. I suspect that most of the sympathy for Minister Hand is because, after all, he happens to be a left winger. That is why people are feeling some compassion for him: he supports their views. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, most of the people in these groups believe that Minister Hand misled the House of Representatives in answer to a question by my colleague Mr Shipton. They believe that he misled the House of Representatives and that he then sent into the Senate a message which misled the Senate. These people also believe there is a third offence, that is, that he and his departmental and ministerial officers made an attempt to cover up this misleading by him of the House of Representatives. In effect, most people around this place believe that Minister Hand is guilty of at least three major offences for which he ought to resign or, if he will not resign, be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand-and this is putting the case at its weakest-Minister Tate has tabled in this chamber documents which in effect acknowledged that Minister Hand misled the Senate in a statement which was read to the Senate on his behalf by his colleague Minister Bolkus. Honourable senators will recall Minister Hand's somewhat pathetic attempt to excuse himself for misleading the House of Representatives, which in effect scored him the double: he misled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not attempt to go through the evidence which is clearly before the Senate about these matters, because it has been debated at length. I could summarise it in perhaps three or four minutes, but I do not want to go on with that evidence except to refer to the misleading of the Senate, which as I said before, was pathetic. In addition, I put it to the Senate that the way in which the Minister misled the Senate was a clear indication of the breakdown in the communication between the Minister and his Department. It is clear that the Minister had not taken any notice of the briefing which the Department had given him right at the initial stages of becoming a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand became a Minister in July last year. The initial briefing of the Department clearly pointed out to him that Arthur Andersen and Co. had conducted an audit of the affairs of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, that NAIHO had not come through that audit successfully, and that funding had ceased. Yet Minister Hand had the audacity to say in his statement to the Senate that he had never even heard of this document before and that it had never been referred to him. It was a clear indication of a breakdown because it was referred to not only in the initial briefing but also in the briefing given to him on 29 August, a briefing note which he signed acknowledging that he had seen it, in preparation for his meeting with the representatives of NAIHO on 31 August. That briefing note also contained reference to that report, but Minister Hand has so little relationship with his Department that he apparently did not even bother to read the Department's briefing note. That, of course, is the third leg of the censure motion which my colleague Senator Chaney has moved in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to the relationship between the Minister and his Department. Senator Collins shook his head when I said that it was the third leg of the motion. It is the third leg of the censure motion because, as the motion reads, the Senate is censuring the Prime Minister for:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I was referring to. I would like to go on with regard to the Minister's maladministration of his Department. One must remember that when Mr Hand came into this portfolio he had had very extensive contacts with Aboriginal activists in the community. Many of them have expressed deep resentment of departmental officers. In fact, many of them have expressed hatred of departmental officers. Mr Hand, with his close knowledge of many of these activists, has in fact surrounded himself with them. He has surrounded himself with them in his ministerial office and has excluded officers of his Department from contact with him over various matters and from contact with these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of this is the one that we have in fact been debating, when Mr Hand excluded Mr McDonald from the meeting with NAIHO. Mr McDonald had prepared all of the briefs to the Minister about NAIHO and had all of the intimate knowledge about it, going back many years. He had prepared the briefs explaining all of the problems to the Minister. He put forward in his briefing note the various questions which the Minister should put to the representatives of NAIHO at the meeting. Mr McDonald was excluded from the meeting with NAIHO for the reason that the officers of NAIHO did not want him present. Just imagine that: the officers of NAIHO coming along to make a submission to the Minister did not want the departmental officer there because he knew too much. He might prod them about some of their failings which had been exposed by the inquiry of Arthur Andersen and Co., so Minister Hand agreed to exclude the departmental officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Minister Hand that he have a conference with his colleague Mr Tom Uren, because recently I read a report of Mr Uren saying that, when he was Minister, he always made sure that his departmental head was present whenever he was meeting anyone of any significance at all, and on other occasions ensured that other officers were present. That is very good advice for Minister Hand, who had apparently excluded his departmental officers from many of his meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> There is in the administration of government affairs a need for departmental administrators to be kept fully informed and for them to be present at meetings between Ministers and the supplicants of Ministers. We acknowledge that the use of conversational minutes of meetings may sometimes be burdensome, but they obviate the traps that this Minister has so clearly fallen into. If a Minister defies those conventions and ignores departmental advice, he has a responsibility to ensure that his directions are recorded and that there is a system that ensures his Department understands fully its riding orders. If Mr Hand claims, as he does, that Mr McDonald and the Department got it wrong, it is Mr Hand's fault, not Mr McDonald's fault, because that is his responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. As my colleague Senator Stone points out, if Minister Hand claims that a different outcome was the result of his meeting with NAIHO, where were his ministerial staff recording the outcome of that meeting? There is no other record, other than the file note made by Mr McDonald on the day after the meeting, that, after the meeting from which he was excluded and which went for an hour and a quarter, the Minister called him into his office and said, in effect, `I've agreed to fund them and you don't like it obviously', to which Mr McDonald said, `Yes, obviously'. They then had a discussion about the funding arrangements. As Mr McDonald has said in one of the subsequent memos, `as if we would have gone this far if there had not been an agreement to fund them'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that Mr Hand agreed, on 31 August, to recommence funding NAIHO. Not only did he do that but, as has been indicated in a question by my colleague Senator Puplick in the Senate today, and as will in due course be revealed, Mr Hand has also started reappointing people who had previously been taken out of responsible positions because of their failings. We have evidence that Mr Hand, when he was going around Australia meeting various Aboriginal groups to try to sell them the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposal, received a number of requests for funding. The decisions on the expenditure of funds were not as a result of submissions properly considered by the Department in relation to the needs and responsibilities of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that, but as I understand it-and Senator Collins can correct me if I am wrong-the point about these decisions is that they were made practically on the run. In other words, the Minister went around and had these people come to him saying, `Well, Minister, we need some money'. He made a note of that in his diary and when he got back he said to the Department, `Well, you had better give these people the money'. Let us look at some of the things which he funded. I will not name the particular bodies, but a football carnival had been conducted in a particular place. This carnival got a little out of hand and cost more than it should have, so he gave $12,661 to cover the additional costs. He funded vehicles all over the place, for example: requests for vehicles, $16,000; request for a bus, $40,000; request for a four-wheel drive vehicle, $26,500; request for another four-wheel drive vehicle, $26,500; request for a replacement bus, $18,000; a community development officer wanted in another place, $38,700 this year; $46,560 next year and the year after; funds sought to cover a shortfall in anticipated receipts from Medibank, $42,888, $7,000 next year; a school trip to Expo; and other expenses totalling $800,000 over a period of about three years.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The relevance is that as far as I am concerned this Minister is going around conducting business in a chequebook manner; that is making decisions on the run, handing out money on the run. I do not see that it falls within the community program budgeting adopted by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). I do not see that it is a matter for which the Prime Minister would say, `This is the proper way to administer this portfolio'. I believe it is clear evidence that the Prime Minister ought to be taking a greater hand in the administration of this Department. If the Prime Minister had bothered to apply his mind to the matters which we have been debating here over a period, I believe he would dismiss this Minister. We have had the Perkins affairs, in relation to the resignation of Mr Charles Perkins over a difference of opinion on the allocation of funds for the Woden Town Club. We have had the revelations about the wasted funding of the Oasis Hotel. We have had the Senate Estimates Committee discovering the $300,000 allocation for poker machines. All in all, we are getting an emerging picture that the Minister has failed in his responsibility properly to administer the Department. It is clear that there is now little trust between the Minister and his Department and that distrust must seriously be affecting departmental morale and the ability of the Department to perform its function efficiently. All of this must be to the detriment of the Aboriginal people of Australia. That is why the Minister stands condemned. We have the Tranby College affair where this Minister is constantly bypassing the Department. Now we are in a situation where there are seven major inquiries being conducted into the Department, or departmental matters, and there are six inter- departmental inquiries. All in all some 13 inquiries are being conducted. Let me now turn to ministerial responsibility. I adopt the words of my illustrious predecessor, the late Senator Greenwood who, on 13 May 1975, in relation to a motion of censure, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the heart of our system of responsible government is the accountability of the Executive to the Parliament. Ministers are members of the Parliament. They are responsible to the Parliament for the discharge of their ministerial duties. Ministers are stewards of a trust and in the Parliament they may be asked questions as to how they have discharged that stewardship. It is of the very essence of the system under which this country is governed that when questions are asked of Ministers honest answers are given. The Parliament ought not to be misled. The Parliament ought not to be lied to. The Parliament ought not to be denied that knowledge which is essential to the proper government of the country. There are ministerial tactics by which an evasion of a question may be attempted . . . There are the occasional slips of tongue. There are the occasional mistakes. This motion takes no account of those incidents. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what Senator Greenwood said then. I also agree with the last sentence. This motion moved by Senator Chaney today takes no account of those incidents such as `slips of tongue' or `occasional mistakes'. I also refer to the attitude adopted by Mr Whitlam when he was Prime Minister. I compare his attitude towards the misleading of Parliament with that of the current Prime Minister. In a letter to Mr Whitlam on 2 July, Dr Cairns said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to resign from any position I hold because I answered the question in Parliament in the clear and sincere belief that what I said was true. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Dr Cairns really believed, when he gave his answer, that what he said was true. Mr Whitlam replied immediately, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not regard these documents as satisfactory explanations of these two issues which I put to you . . . Since you write that you do not intend to resign from any position you hold, I must advise the Governor-General to terminate your commission. He will receive me at 8 o'clock this evening. </PARA>
<PARA>What a pity that Mr Hawke has not bothered to read A Certain Grandeur by Graham Freudenberg and to read Mr Whitlam's approach to the Parliament. That is one of the problems when a fellow like Mr Hawke does not give a tuppeny about the principles of parliament or the traditions of parliament and is only interested in the executive authority of government. In relation to Mr Connor's dismissal over the Khemlani affair, Mr Whitlam said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have made it clear throughout the life of this Government that there is one standard which, if departed from, must carry the heaviest penalty. It is a principle on which the integrity of the Parliament itself depends. There was, I believe, a departure from that principle . . . The principle and my insistence upon it was made amply clear, tragically clear, only three months ago, in the case of the honourable member for Lalor. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring there to Dr Cairns. Mr Whitlam's statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA>In that case, and in this, there was and is no reflection whatsoever on the personal integrity of the Minister involved. The error of judgment in both cases was the same. The consequences of that error of judgment, the same, but let me emphasise, those consequences spring not from misconduct, but from standards in relation to a narrow, precise, but fundamentally important principle which this Government and I as head of this Government must insist upon. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been no doubt what Mr Whitlam would have done with Mr Hand. He would have done it some time ago. Let us look at what happened with the Hon. John Brown, the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In tendering his resignation to the Governor-General on 17 December last year he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I had no intention whatever to deceive Parliament . . . I have been shown to be wrong on the facts, but my conscience is and will remain completely clear. Because of my respect for the institution of Parliament I feel that I have no alternative in all circumstances but to resign as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke has often talked about the excellent standards of his Ministry. Under this convention Mr Hand should resign. On 25 August 1981, when Mr Hawke was considering an action by a Fraser Government Minister, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that if a Minister misleads the House whether deliberately or through gross incompetence he should, with any decency, tender his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA>Under that criteria Mr Hand should resign. In his Robert Garran oration on 27 October of this year Mr Hawke sought to redefine ministerial responsibility to occasions in which a Minister has been personally involved in a matter of administration. But even under that criteria Mr Hand should go because he has clearly been personally involved. Mr Hawke often talks about the excellent standards of his ministry. Ministerial standards are so lax that the tradition of ministerial responsibility under this Government has become a forgotten concept. I could go on with a list of very many cases where Ministers have not fulfilled what would traditionally have been considered to be full responsibility under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that Ministers of the Parliament should not easily discard either the parliamentary or administrative conventions. This whole sorry saga demonstrates the obvious failures in Minister Hand's administration. If ministerial responsibility means anything at all he should-I quote the Prime Minister's own words on misleading the House either deliberately or through gross incompetence-`with any decency, tender his resignation' to this House. If the Minister is not prepared to resign, the Prime Minister, even under his own narrow guidelines-the ones he espoused in the Robert Garran oration, which fall short of the Westminster convention-should sack Minister Hand for the incompetence he has displayed in the administration of his Department and for his misleading the House of Representatives and the Senate and for the attempt to cover up his misleading of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that so far Mr Hawke has been protecting Mr Hand? We know that it has to do with Mr Hawke's need to keep Mr Hand, the left winger, because of his relationship with the Victorian Labor Party and his Federal relationships here. He is concerned about the loony Left of the Labor Party in Victoria in particular, and the fact that so far Mr Hand has proven to be a rational left winger, someone that Mr Hawke can deal with, as opposed to the loonies, who might very well take over the left wing of the Labor Party if Mr Hawke gets rid of people such as Mr Hand. So far Mr Hawke has been protecting Mr Hand, not because of not realising that he has done wrong but because of political reasons only. Only for political reasons has he been protecting Mr Hand from the dismissal which should take place now. If Mr Hawke would only adopt the standards of Mr Whitlam, the Parliament would see some action taken forthwith concerning this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little surprised to hear Senator Lewis refer to Mr Whitlam in the Khemlani affair in view of the evidence that has come out in the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland and the rather sordid matters which surrounded some of those matters to which he referred. I do not think they reflect all that well on the Opposition. I am really surprised that he has taken that matter up and brought it into this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to reflect on the third point of the censure motion, which refers to the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs-and I emphasise the following words-to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. That is a very relevant part of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Before doing that I would like to read into the record a very short piece from a paper called Public Policy in Australia by Davis, Wanna, Warhurst and Weller, under the heading `Policy at the Centre'. These authors, who are political scientists, make the following point, reflecting on policy in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>In almost all cases, Australian politicians have not resigned their portfolios whenever a mistake is made, though such demands are invariably heard from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to a Minister, they say:</PARA>
<PARA>He will only resign if the Prime Minister believes it is for the good of the Government but in most cases that simply admits error and, party conflict being what it is, admission of error is more serious than the error itself. </PARA>
<PARA>They conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>Ministerial responsibility is a convention which operates only when it accords with political judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of what Senator Tate said earlier and what Senator Macklin before him pointed out, I think that adequately deals with the first two points of this censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> In turning to the third matter-namely, the Prime Minister's failure to ensure the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians-I think we need to remember the background of Aboriginal Australians during the whole period of white settlement, a matter which Senator Macklin was referring to before he left the chamber. We have a people in this country who occupied Australia for a very long period. Those people were displaced by Europeans only 200 years ago. The Aboriginal people were shot, poisoned, or displaced from their land, and their culture was taken away from them. Those conditions, as Senator Macklin was pointing out, continued right up until the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. Senator Macklin was pointing out that he knew people whose parents had been shot before their very eyes. </PARA>
<PARA> At that point Senator Stone was interjecting, `Take an aspirin; take an aspirin; take an aspirin'. I point out that one normally takes an aspirin for a headache or some minor ailment. It seems that Senator Stone's interjection clearly indicates the level of concern that he has for these very serious crimes which were perpetrated against Aboriginal people. He assumed that one could overcome the enormous emotional anguish which is associated with reflection on those matters by simply taking an aspirin. That says a great deal about the political context of this censure motion. I reflect again on the statement in Public Policy in Australia that the ministerial responsibilities convention operates only when it accords with political judgment. We need to use our political judgment in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that have been borne in upon me since I have been looking after the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs for the Australian Democrats-and several other senators have reflected on this in this debate-is the incredible complexity and difficulty of this portfolio area. A number of Aboriginal people are still living substantially in their traditional way, associated with their traditional lands and supported by their cultural and political systems. We also have large numbers of Aboriginal people who are totally displaced from their traditional lands, who have lost links with their traditional culture and who are attempting to survive, albeit with great difficulty, in an urban setting. A small number of Aboriginal people have been well educated, have tertiary and secondary qualifications and are performing extremely well in the mainstream of white society. In attempting to administer the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, one has to address all of those groups of people. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me also, looking at the history of Aboriginal administration, that there was just as much corruption-if one wants to call it that-maladministration and misappropriation of funding when the coalition Government was administering Aboriginal Affairs between 1975 and 1983 as has gone on since 1983. Indeed, one need look no further than the fact that the Aboriginal Development Commission was created by, and was a child of, the Fraser Government. I do not doubt in any sense that it was created with very good intentions. I think the intentions were absolutely honourable. Recognition of prior Aboriginal occupation was written into the legislation setting up that body. A capital fund was created by the Fraser Government to compensate Aboriginals for dispossession of their land. In 1975 a House of Representatives inquiry was held into the Aboriginal Development Commission. If one goes back and looks at the evidence which was put before that inquiry, one finds precisely the sorts of things which the Opposition is now accusing the Government of in relation to maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do not find the charge that the Prime Minister has failed to ensure proper and orderly administration to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians a charge which is proven. I find that the Prime Minister and his Minister are attempting to administer an extremely difficult portfolio. Ministers on both sides of this chamber and the other place are aware, and have been aware for many years, of these difficulties. I believe that this Minister has been attempting to address some of these problems. I believe that underlying the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal is the idea that Aboriginal people should be able to assume more self-determination and self-administration. </PARA>
<PARA> A quotation of what I said which appeared in today's Canberra Times was read into the record earlier today. I do not resile from what I said. I believe that the Minister has made mistakes in relation to the people he has chosen to surround himself with. He has made an attempt to go down a different path in relation to a very difficult portfolio which, over many years, has been demonstrably fraught with enormous difficulty for Ministers on both sides of politics. So, by the standards of the administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs-and that is the only standard one can use to judge Ministers-I do not find that this Minister has performed significantly more poorly than other Ministers, and certainly not to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians. For that reason, I believe it is appropriate to reject this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, I believe that when one looks at the alternative administration and the clear indication by the Opposition that it would hand the administration of Aboriginal affairs back to the States, that it would mainstream Aboriginal affairs through State administrations, and that it would deny Aboriginal land claims, one can see quite clearly that the Opposition's alternative policies are certainly to the detriment of Aboriginal Australians because they do nothing whatsoever to recognise the unique cultural differences of Aboriginal Australians. The Opposition is attempting to look on Aboriginal people as if they were Europeans. They are not Europeans. They have a different culture and a different background, and that needs to be recognised. So, again by the Opposition's own standards, I find the charge that this Government is administering Aboriginal affairs to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians rather false in view of the track down which the Opposition would take the administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>

But it was indicated that that would not be a good thing to do, so I will not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I get on to paragraph (c), I want to address (a) and (b) of this motion, which relate to the alleged misleading of the House by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, on 8 November. I state again categorically-any fair reading of the record and of the papers tabled in the Parliament will demonstrate this-that Minister Hand did not mislead the House of Representatives. Much has been made of the statements by Mr McDonald, and I draw attention to them again. The substantive statement from Mr McDonald was made on 2 December when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then read me the text of an answer he had given earlier that day to a question about his `decision'-</PARA>
<PARA>those are Mr McDonald's quotation marks-</PARA>
<PARA>to fund NAIHO. I confirmed that the answer was accurate and consistent with my recollection of his advice to me after his meeting with NAIHO some weeks earlier. I have since read the relevant Hansard, which was consistent with the Minister's earlier reading to me, and have no reason to change my view of the accuracy of his reply. </PARA>
<PARA>One cannot get much more categorical than that. It all then relates to what is a decision. I said in debate yesterday, and I will say it again today, that I think Minister Hand's version of events and Mr McDonald's version of events are probably both correct. I have been with the Minister when he has visited Aboriginal communities. Not surprisingly with communities who rarely see Federal Ministers responsible for the vital needs of their communities, it is a theme of those visits that many approaches are made to Ministers. I have made many myself on the spot. For example, I went with the Minister to Yuendumu. We stood in front of a demolished set of public toilets in very bad repair. They had received no maintenance for many years and were in dire need of repair. The Minister said, `Those toilets have to be fixed'. I suppose I could fairly say that the Minister had made a decision to replace those toilets. But, having been in politics for a few years, I would not be silly enough to say that because I know perfectly well that, when the Minister had made his decision that the funding had to be granted, it would then have to go through all the processes-of finding out whether funds are available, whether appropriate contractors are available, whether the design is appropriate and whether all sorts of conditions attached to these things are appropriate. I am pleased to say that, after a period of some 12 months had elapsed, all of those procedures had been found to be appropriate and the toilets were delivered. </PARA>

But every document tabled in the Parliament very clearly reveals that all of the matters related to that decision to fund had not been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one thing that is missing from this entire collection of documents, because it does not exist, is the absolutely necessary element in a ministerial decision, that is, a written directive from the Minister to the Department upon which it can act to fund the Organisation. That was never delivered. The Organisation has not been funded; therefore, that decision was not made. Therefore, for the second time in 24 hours, it is clear that the Minister did not mislead the House. Further to that, any fair-minded person would look at the context in which the question was asked. Mr Shipton in fact asked, `Has funding for NAIHO been recommenced?'. That was the question. Clearly, funding for NAIHO has not been recommenced. The Minister did not mislead the House. Therefore, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this motion have to fail. </PARA>
<PARA> But I want to address (c). Along with some other people in this House, I was sorry that the Opposition tried to dress up with a bit of cant and hypocrisy in paragraph (c) the reason for running this debate, crying crocodile tears about how dreadfully concerned it is about Aboriginal people. The written policy produced by the Opposition gives the lie to that. The Opposition is into mainstreaming services, removing any emphasis of Aboriginality from the delivery of services. That is the consistent theme of the Opposition in its written policy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most tragic steps backwards in Aboriginal affairs, from the former bipartisan support that existed in Aboriginal affairs in Australia, was taken by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) when he removed any special consideration for Aboriginal people because of their status as the indigenous people of this country. When the Opposition first brought out that tragic policy change, that shift in direction, John Howard said, `We are very concerned about Aboriginal people in Australia, as we are concerned about any other disadvantaged group in this country, and Aboriginal people will get the same consideration as any other disadvantaged minority will get', thus flying in the face of the way that indigenous people have been treated in any progressive country, be it Canada, the United States of America or any other one cares to name. Aborigines have the right to claim special status as the indigenous people of this country who were cruelly dispossessed without any attempt made at reparation or compensation. They have special status but that special status, so far as the Opposition is concerned, was removed by John Howard. So let us see no more crocodile tears about the Opposition's concern for Aboriginal affairs. Let us look at the record of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and his effectiveness as a Minister. </PARA>

That measure of effectiveness does not reflect very well on the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make one other point about the approach of the Opposition to this matter. It is unfortunate that Senator Tambling has operated on a shotgun approach to this question. He has not been very selective. Again today he has engaged in innuendo and smear and made personal attacks on people. I commend Senator Giles for making the other day what I thought was a very spirited and accurate defence of one of the individuals in Western Australia who has been maligned by Opposition senators in here. There is a problem when one takes the shotgun approach. Frankly, it is a political problem. If one selects one's targets narrowly, one does not end up with egg on one's face. But, if one starts shooting 12-gauge shells in all directions, occasionally one hits targets that one does not want to hit. I will just demonstrate one of them. Senator Tambling said that the Minister, Mr Hand, had exercised `undue influence in the case of funding for Middar'-the Western Australian dance company. </PARA>

I was familiar with the negotiations over the makarrata because I was part of them. I was Leader of the Party at the time or the member for Arnhem or something-I cannot remember how many years ago it was now-and I actually travelled with the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, paying my own expenses of course, which took evidence at Yirrkala on the question of the makarrata. I remember that because of the problems that then occurred over the question of the name and what makarrata meant. Until that time makarrata was thought to mean a treaty signed between two people. It almost meant  that--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chaney" NAMEID="EF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it meant was a reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does mean a reconciliation. What it refers to is the ceremony which, at Yirrkala, would normally be conducted down on the beach. If a member of an opposing tribe had committed a serious offence-which usually was stealing somebody else's wife-and war had broken out between the two tribes as a result, a makarrata was held where a representative of the offending tribe had to place himself at the disposal of the other tribe and be ritually speared to death on the beach. The elders at Yirrkala-and I was there when it happened-had a hilarious discussion about how they thought it would be entirely appropriate for Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister to put himself in that role, and they indicated that they would be quite happy to spear him to death on the beach at Yirrkala if he wanted a makarrata. It was at that point in time that I thought that perhaps-and I might add that the Senate Committee came to the same conclusion-we had better go cautiously with this proposal if that sort of misunderstanding had occurred so early in the piece.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the key point I want to make is that Senator Chaney, the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, fully supported the activities of the then National Aboriginal Conference in negotiating, consulting, seeking out the views of Aboriginal people around Australia on the makarrata. This is what Senator Chaney said about the makarrata in the Senate on 23 April 1980 when he was asked to define his Government's approach to the treaty:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the concern which is felt by some Australians that the concept of a treaty involves the recognition, in some way, of two nations is a concern that the Government would wish to put to rest. The Government's approach to the treaty . . . is this: We are not looking at two nations; we are looking at how the Australian nation properly deals with the situation of its Aboriginal people. If we can arrive at arrangements between the national government and the Aboriginal people of Australia which are consensual in nature and which represent the views of the Aboriginal citizens of this country as to what is appropriate, I believe we will have advanced. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are fine words and, I might add, words with which I concur. It is not reasonable to say that the treaty that the Leader of the Opposition discussed in here in a statement in 1980 which I supported is going to bring down this nation; nor should it be properly held out as being an unachievable object which has been unfairly held out to Aboriginal people when in fact it received the full support in 1980 of the Leader of the Opposition as the Minister when he spoke in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Part (c) of this motion also has to fail, as do parts (a) and (b). The achievements of this Government during its terms of office in the area of Aboriginal affairs have been considerable. Since 1984 the provision of basic essential services under the town campers' assistance program has been extended to 135 town camps-a crying need around this country. Since 1981 the percentage of Aboriginal students in secondary education has more than doubled. Almost 1,000 Aboriginal and Islander people now hold post-secondary education awards. The median income of Aboriginal and Islander people has increased by almost 70 per cent in the course of this Government's administration. The Aboriginal infant mortality rate, although it is still unacceptably high, has been significantly reduced in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The number of Aboriginal controlled medical services has tripled in the life of this Government, which is one of the reasons for the lowering of that death rate. The coalition's present policy appears to want to abolish these medical services with mainstreaming. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the community development employment program to over 90 Aboriginal and Islander communities has been achieved around the country. A national health working party, to report in early 1989, has been established. A priority community development strategy totalling $49m has been established over two years. Special health initiatives totalling $13.5m over two years have been provided by this Government. Special initiatives for Aboriginal and Islander women and youth and special public awareness funds have been provided totalling $126m over two years. The reason I have included that tedious repetition of figures is that the one response to all of those commendable initiatives from the Opposition was a virulent criticism from Senator Stone, the then Opposition spokesperson for Finance, who attacked the increased spending on Aboriginal affairs. Opposition senators then come in here this afternoon and cry crocodile tears, trying to clothe this debate in clothing that it is not fit to wear. They are not concerned about Aboriginal people; they are trying to drag down a Labor Minister. They have provided this Senate with no material at all on which they can succeed. </PARA>

Be that as it may, the issue under debate is a matter of great importance and great concern to the Australian Democrats. The issues at stake are Australian Aboriginal people and their future. Looking at the censure motion put forward by the Opposition, I would say that paragraph (a) we dealt with yesterday at length; paragraph (b) I regard as irrelevant; but paragraph (c) I regard as important and as a matter which can be debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling spoke of the policies of this Government as being nonsense, and he blamed the policies of this Government.

<PARA> Having listened to this debate, I am quite surprised at the level of almost desperation in some of the speeches made by the Opposition. Senator Tambling showed no sign of wanting to be helpful or constructive in any way in this very difficult area of Aboriginal affairs. I was very surprised at Senator Stone's lack of sensitivity. He seemed to be disputing the fact that the Aboriginal people have suffered a great deal over the last 200 years. In fact, I know Aboriginal people in their late thirties and early forties who were taken from their parents and who still do not know where their parents are, because of past policies. </PARA>

Because she liked to get there at the crack of dawn to get the washing out before the light of day, as they walked along the road from the reserve to the town they had to dash into the bushes and hide if anyone else came along the road because, as non-citizens, they were simply not allowed to be out and about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at paragraph (c) of this motion, I do not doubt that there has been some failure to ensure orderly and proper administration in the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. I believe that this has been to the continuing detriment of Aboriginal Australians, but, as I said before, I do not think that this Government has the monopoly on that score by any means. Senator Lewis also gave us a list involving some thousands of dollars alleged to be misappropriated. I cannot condone that in any way at all. Neither can I condone the Western Australian Government's involvement with Western Australia Inc. and its activities, which no doubt will cost the taxpayers some millions of dollars. Neither of those issues can be condoned, but I mentioned the second one simply to place what we are talking about within context. It is known, and has been mentioned by previous speakers, that the coalition Opposition want to disband some of the special areas which have been set up for the Aboriginal people in the name of creating one Australia. We cannot be one when we all start from different positions of advantage or disadvantage. We cannot possibly have anything like one nation when we have people who are severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I stated previously that paragraph (c) of the motion does have some validity. I say again that I do have some problems with the credibility of the Opposition in putting up this motion. On occasions the Liberals in the Opposition-I exclude the National Party from this-have grossly exaggerated, if not totally distorted, the positions of the Australian Democrats and me over a number of issues. I have heard the Opposition-the Liberals and Nationals-speak against a casino for Canberra and yet vote for it. I have heard them speak for a non-discriminatory immigration policy and yet vote against the Government's motion for a non-discriminatory immigration policy for Australia. As I say, the issues are important. They are of concern to the Australian Democrats. The issues involved are of great importance to the Aboriginal people. In my talks with the Aboriginal people, I have found that the issues that are of particular concern to them are land rights and access to ceremonial land areas, the upholding of their language and culture in their traditional areas, education, and health. Most of all, I believe, their concern is to recapture their former spirit and their very life essence. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of this motion has merits. I certainly intended to vote on this issue on its merits. It is very difficult to do this when I listen to the arguments that have been brought down, I believe for political reasons, by the Opposition. I look forward very much to hearing what Senator Chaney now has to say in the conclusion of the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak in this debate this afternoon, although naturally I fully support the motion that has been moved by Senator Chaney. But in view of the remarks earlier this afternoon by Senator Macklin, which have been subsequently adverted to by Senator Colston and, in a much briefer way, by Senator Jenkins, who has just sat down, I must take two or three minutes of the Senate's time to set the record straight on some of the more egregious exaggerations, slanders, defamations and so on which have been emerging from the Australian Democrats' camp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just recount for the benefit of honourable senators who may not have been present earlier: in the course of Senator Macklin's remarks he became-as, I think it is fair to say, Senator Macklin is wont to do-a little excitable and began recounting his version of the history of the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, not all of which redounds to the credit of European settlers in this country, but equally not most of which redounds to their discredit either, as anyone who takes a balanced view of these matters would conclude, rather than the totally unbalanced view which has been expressed by Senator Macklin and, indeed, was expressed a moment ago by Senator Jenkins, although I have to say, in deference to her, in a much more restrained manner. At that point, because I happen to have the misfortune in some ways of sitting in close proximity to Senator Macklin, I told him to `come off it', or words to that effect-I am not sure whether Hansard would have got the words-in response to which Senator Macklin became even more violent and intemperate in his remarks. Again, I note that that is Senator Macklin's behaviour pattern on such occasions: he begins to become more and more excitable, more and more declamatory and more and more-if I may say so-irrational. </PARA>
<PARA> At that point-and I now pick up Senator Collins's attempted reconstruction of events a moment ago-I suggested to Senator Macklin that he should take an aspirin and go and have a lie down. That is what I said. I said it for the very good reason that it did seem to me that Senator Macklin was in some danger to his health, given the declamation with which he was proceeding. As we all know, Senator Macklin then proceeded to accuse me of the most extraordinary attitudes towards the Aboriginal people of this country, which will be recorded in the Hansard and which will stand there to Senator Macklin's shame, not to mine, because the accusations which were made against me by Senator Macklin bear no resemblance to the truth. Even Senator Macklin, I hope, may, on more sober reflection, agree with that judgment. Having done that, he then proceeded to an even more infamous charge relating to what he alleged to be my attitude to Buchenwald. It was at that point that Senator Chaney, quite properly, rose and suggested that Senator Macklin might be given the opportunity to withdraw those totally-not merely unparliamentary-disgraceful remarks addressed to a fellow senator for whose attitudes in that regard he has not the slightest scrap of evidence; indeed, quite the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, my only surprise in all of those events was that Senator Macklin refused to take the opportunity which you, quite properly, then gave him to withdraw his disgraceful remarks. Indeed, he compounded the offence by saying that he would not withdraw them because they were true. I naturally regret that, as a consequence of Senator Macklin's actions, it was your unfortunate duty and the unfortunate duty of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) to initiate the processes which led to the suspension of Senator Macklin from this place for the remainder of this sitting day. I do not regard it as an appropriate event for this Senate to see a senator suspended, but I have to say that the events leading up to it I regard as even less appropriate. </PARA>

On this side of the chamber we are matching each speaker from the other side. That is because of the political exigencies of the situation. I point out that this is simply a political exercise. I do not say that in any derogatory sense. Senator Chaney would have to agree that what this is centrally and fundamentally about-I do not suggest for one minute that many of the points put forward were not sincere-has already been read into the Hansard, and I think it is proper to read it again. It appears in the Herald of Tuesday, 6 December 1988. Senator Tambling has already confirmed this, and this is what this debate is all about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a no ball, but I will give him this: even though it was a no ball he kept on with it. This censure motion was lost very early in the afternoon, but with considerable courage, considerable drive, Senator Chaney went on batting. Even though his jaw was broken he stood at the wicket with the bat and said, `I'm going to bat this out, because I've got to show the people of Australia just how true is the statement that censure motions-motions to get Ministers to resign-are very much political motions'. He has gone down that path very courageously. I will again quote from Public Policy in Australia, not in any cynical fashion but because these great political analysts have observed this over the years:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a former minister noted, ministerial responsibility in practice means that `the Minister is responsible to Parliament for his Department to explain, and where error is shown, he takes the corrective action. He will only resign if the Prime Minister believes it is for the good of the Government but in most cases that simply admits error and, party conflict being what it is, admission of error is more serious than the error itself'. </PARA>
<PARA>I could quote further but time is short. The reality is that Mr Hand will not and should not resign. This has been an occasion of robust debate in this chamber. No doubt many statements have been produced which honourable senators opposite will be able to mail out to their various constituents-the most important constituents at this time being the members of preselection panels. I think that people have been rather nasty to Senator Chaney in saying he does many of these things because of the preselection for the new seat coming up in Western Australia. If that is so, I think he has done it brilliantly. He ought to send out the Hansard of his speeches to the preselection panel. </PARA>

It will be defeated, as it should be defeated, because it is, as the learned editors of this journal have said, another example of a political exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-If I had my head in my hands for a while during Senator Cooney's speech, I am sure honourable senators will understand why. After all, we are debating a censure motion, which is perhaps the most serious motion that can be put before the Senate. Senator Cooney managed to impart a lightheartedness that perhaps some other contributions have not brought. Not surprisingly, this debate has brought out some very strong personal responses, not least because there is a series of honourable senators in this chamber-indeed it is true in each of the parties in this chamber that there are such people-with a long and consistent and deep personal interest in the subject we are discussing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern we have shared in very different ways is not the worthiness of Minister Hand or the worthiness of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but how the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the policies administered by the Commonwealth Government with respect to Aboriginal affairs can be brought forward to the advantage of Aboriginal Australians. It is not something which has proved easy in any government, under any administration, and there are many blots on our history which we would prefer to forget. I noted in particular the points Senator Collins made when he raised a number of aspects of my own involvement in Aboriginal affairs. Those points in some way cast doubt on what was being done. It was interesting, for example, that he brought forward the representations with which he said I was associated with respect to the Aboriginal dance company, Middar. In light of the fact that this matter was raised, it is worth putting the story on the table, because I think it demonstrates that the Opposition's approach of trying to get to the bottom of what we see as very serious and significant wrongs in the administration of Aboriginal affairs under the present Government is not an approach which has been undertaken without a good deal of work being done to try to bring about change in a quieter, more positive way. </PARA>
<PARA> Middar is but one of the Aboriginal contacts I have had over the last year or so that has come to me expressing concern about maladministration. Middar was in desperate difficulty. I took only preliminary advice from that group but that preliminary advice from the people involved was in these terms: `Middar received a commitment from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). We are a successful dance company and we wish to undertake a tour to the United States. We received an undertaking for substantial funding'-I think in total it was something over $300,000, but I speak from memory-`and we got a commitment so we undertook expenditure. We are now in debt, $170,000 or thereabouts, because the commitment was withdrawn, and we think we have been shamefully treated by the ADC'. I think that would be a fair potted summary of the interview I had with my Aboriginal constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not normally come into the Parliament and talk about this but it is history now and the matter has been raised. I told the Middar people that I thought that on the face of it they had a case to make out but I thought they would not successfully make out that case by dealing with it in a political or adversarial manner. Therefore, my advice to them was to consult a Labor senator who I thought would more easily than a Liberal senator be able to raise such an issue of substance and have it dealt with on its merits and, one would hope, have the matter solved. I thereupon went down to Senator Beahan's office. He was not in but I discussed the matter with his staff. I said it was my view that they could be of more help to the Aboriginal people than I could be, and would they consider looking at the matter. I say immediately that I got absolute cooperation from Senator Beahan's staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that Senator Beahan and I had a brief discussion about this-it may have been in the lift; certainly it was in passing-and I asked whether progress was being made. My main concern was that the Aboriginal people might think that I had brushed them off. I went to some pains to say to them-I think I wrote but I have not had time to check-that if they had any concerns, they were free to come back to me and to raise those concerns, but I trusted that the matter would be fixed up. I have no idea what happened subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that explanation because the truth of the matter is that I and I am sure other Opposition people have raised many matters privately, dealing with them in a way that was meant to be constructive. I want to make a point in addition to that anecdote which simply reflects on this question which the Australian Democrats raise in a way which is, whether they like it or not, just as sharp and just as painful as any criticism that is ever made of them. They make consistent criticisms of people on this side of the House for their supposed dreadful attitudes. I have had a succession of private discussions with members of the Australian Labor Party from 1983 on, with some of the most senior people in the Government. I have expressed my deep concern at what I have seen as a lack of direction-I will come back to this in a minute-and my reasons for believing there has been a lack of direction. Two of the most senior people in the Government-I will not name them-said to me, `Don't bother me; this is not a high priority for us'. That is the response I have had from people in the Government who I respect when I have tried to raise these matters directly, quietly and constructively in the hope that serious errors would not be made. Private members of the Government party know that I have talked to them about the same matters and in a similar spirit. They would know that the response has been nil. That is the prelude to the quite determined effort on the part of the Opposition to get to the bottom of what we see as serious problems in the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. I make no apology at all for the efforts of Opposition senators to disclose maladministration, for example as we did in the recent Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk of the Kimberleys, where I followed in the footsteps of the Australian Democrats senator from Western Australia, Senator Jenkins. I acknowledge, and have publicly acknowledged before, her interest and also the fact that she has enough energy to get off her tail and trek around those difficult parts of Western Australia to talk to Aboriginal people and to listen. I acknowledge that many of the things she said publicly just before Easter of this year were things I agreed with, because she talked to many of the same people that I subsequently spoke with. No one could make that sort of trip or take an interest without knowing that the statistics Senator Collins read are but a part of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the story also is that in my State of Western Australia there is indescribable tension between the white and black communities. It is a disgrace. This indescribable tension impacts on the lives not only of Aboriginal Australians but also of those white Australians who live in close proximity to Aboriginal communities. Whether the Democrats like it or not, and whether members of the Labor Party like it or not, a major contribution to that tension is a lack of regard in the attitudes they put forward for the realities of life that face both black and white. </PARA>
<PARA> When I complained-as I complain without apology again now-in this place about the unrealism of the promises, the lack of reality, the staginess and the national land rights promises that were destined never to be fulfilled, it was because those things have added mightily to the tension that I describe in this speech. Senator Collins referred back to 1980 and quoted my comments on the treaty. The truth of the matter is that at that time, as Minister, I was desperately trying to reduce what I could see were the developing tensions on the issue of a treaty-the issue of two nations. I bent over backwards to try to move away from anything which could be used in a divisive and destructive way. Indeed, the word `makarrata' came from the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) at my request. I said, `There must be a way that we can talk together without giving rise to this spectre of two nations'. The treaty does give rise to that problem. The Aboriginal people came back and said that makarrata is a Yolngu word, and it means a reconciliation. I said, `Terrific; I think there should be a reconciliation between the Aboriginal and white people of this country. If that is the word the NAC says is appropriate, I am happy to use it as long as we get away from the treaty concept'. That was my plea over a long succession of meetings, and they moved to makarrata on the basis that it was something which was about reconciliation. Those words which were read by Senator Collins I do not in any sense recant. Consensual arrangements for Aboriginal Australians were something I saw as being potentially a great positive. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now eight years down the track and the situation is that there has been a considerable increase in the difficulties for the Aboriginal community because of the national land rights campaign, because of the carelessness of the Prime Minister on the treaty, and because, in my view, there has been a lack of attention to the practical difficulties of administration. All of my response so far has been on this third leg-the question of administration. One of the things put up by the Australian Labor Party is, `When Senator Chaney was there 11 per cent or so of the Budget was going on administration and now it is 8.4 per cent or so'. We have been witnessing the failures of administration in Estimates Committee E, in the sorts of responses Senator Crichton-Browne got from the Government over the last few days. My heaven! There are more than 2,000 unacquitted grants. No wonder the Department's levels of administration are cheap. The more money the Government pushes out and the less it bothers to administer it the better its administrative ratio will be. I ask Senator Jenkins: Does she feel that Red Hill was adequately administered in the Kimberleys of Western Australia? Does she think that Oombulgurri was adequately administered in the Kimberleys of Western Australia? Does she think that the places visited by the Human Rights Commission and reported on this year or last year--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what we would expect from Senator Cook. All I am saying is that if Government speakers put it forward as a key argument that the cost of administration as a proportion of the Budget was greater under our Administration, I am not surprised. Let me read what Charles Perkins, as Secretary to the Department, had to say about unacquitted grants in September 1988-in a period when, whacko, the Government was spending only 8.4 per cent of the Budget. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I sought your comments-</PARA>

<PARA>on a number of aspects relating to the current status of the backlog of unacquitted grants. I have since studied the reports you have provided in response to my request. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to express, quote unequivocally, my alarm at the number of unacquitted grants. Put simply, the present situation does little to endow the Department's reputation in terms of discharging the accountability aspect of its administrative processes. I am therefore determined that the problem will be quickly rationalised and overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read on. I simply say that, as Secretary to the Department, Charles Perkins was expressing alarm at the failures of administration. Senator Crichton-Browne has pursued this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the interjection. I hope that it will be recorded in Hansard. The honourable senator said, `There is no good faith. You are run by the mining companies'. That gets me back to the first two parts of this motion. Some honourable senators have taken the view that we were not entitled to move a censure motion on this matter because yesterday the Senate decided, as a matter of fact, that Minister Hand did not mislead the Senate. I refer again to the interjection of Senator Sanders. There is a closed mind. There is a person whose vote I would totally discount in terms of determining whether the Senate was misled. It would not matter what the truth was; that would not be what caused that senator to vote. He has his deep and abiding prejudices and he may not be bound by a caucus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney, jocularly we know, questioned whether people were going to vote on the basis of the determination of the argument. I do not mind standing here and arguing with Senator Cooney but I know that, even if he believes absolutely that I am right, he will not vote with me. I understand and respect that the Labor Party has a caucus system and that is the basis on which the honourable senator was elected by the people of Victoria. I make no complaint about that. But I do complain about those who claim that they determine the issues on their merits. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring again to paragraph (c) of the motion, which refers to `the orderly and proper administration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs'. If honourable senators want to take an almost disgustingly narrow and highly political view of the future it is no advantage to the Opposition to see Hand go. Unless Minister Hand changes his ministerial performance he will be a goldmine for the Opposition. The serious point is that having a Minister who is a goldmine for the Opposition is not what I want in Aboriginal affairs. It is my wish to see Aboriginal affairs off the political agenda between now and the next election and beyond. I think that most people who have seriously engaged in consideration of this matter would think that it is a good thing. What is the basis for that? I do not think I need give a basis for saying that it would be a good thing because clearly this sort of thing is distracting and is probably painful for many Aboriginal people and many others in the community. The basis for having a bipartisan policy is that there has to be a policy which is operating within broad parameters that are agreed on all sides of politics to be reasonable and fair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. But there is a very big distinction between those cases, and cases where the Minister is directly involved and those relatively rare cases where the Minister can be said to have misled the House. Connor, Cairns and Brown represent that separate category where the rule is quite straightforward. In my earlier speech I quoted authorities as to why it must be so and I quoted with very great approval what Senator Macklin had to say yesterday. Let me repeat it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Misleading the Senate is extremely serious, and so it should be, because we have to rely on what we are told by Ministers. That is the only way in which this place can operate. It is a serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a simple statement and, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) would say, it probably does not warrant these hours of argument. But the Manager of Government Business would also know that, when the Government sets its face, the Opposition has only words that it can use in this place; so we have sought to use them. I do not think much more needs to be said. We saw the rule applied with respect to Minister Brown. We are not seeing the rule applied with respect to Minister Hand. I do not believe that the political reasons for doing that are justifiable and I do not believe it is in the interests of this Senate to regard them as justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA> I admire Senator Macklin who yesterday, I think with great pain, voted in favour of our motion because he was prepared to look at the facts. He had said to me earlier in the day, `You have not made out the case'. When we looked at what had happened in the Senate on Monday he accepted that the Opposition had made out a case. I acknowledge, on a day when Senator Macklin has said very cruel and hard things about my colleagues and has been ejected from this chamber as a result, that yesterday he demonstrated that he was prepared to vote according to the facts. I accept that honest men and honest women can differ. All I can say is that Senator Sanders's interjection was pathetic. I adopt that interjection as an explanation of why the Opposition does not believe that the vote yesterday determined a matter of fact. It determined certain alignments in this place. I regret that. It would be nice if it were not so. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the reasons why we have brought forward a serious motion which seeks to censure the Prime Minister. Of course, those opposite have a duty to defend this Minister once the Government has taken a decision to keep a straight bat and to bluff the thing through, and they will stick by the Minister whatever. I can understand their coming in here and arguing the case. But the simple truth is that Gerry Hand, I am sure unintentionally-I think it was gross carelessness on the part of all the Ministers concerned, namely, Hand, Bolkus and Tate, and gross inefficiency on the part of Minister Hand's staff-without any doubt provided inaccurate information and made an inaccurate statement to the Senate. Barney Cooney and others were drawing a complete red herring into the argument. We are not arguing about that difficult area of ministerial responsibility which goes to the question of whether a Minister is responsible for the actions of his public servants. That is a difficult matter and I agree that, in the end, politics dominates the decision as to what happens to a Minister whose department makes a mistake. That is a very political matter. I had the joy of watching Senator Gareth Evans argue the case one way when he was in opposition and eat his words in government. He would probably say that he has had the same joy watching me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us deal with one subject at a time. Let me say that the 1975-76-77 period was fairly close to bipartisanship. The Fraser Government picked up the land rights legislation and, as has been said in the debate, there was a high degree of bipartisanship. What broke it was a highly political approach by the Labor Party which I believe from a conversation I had with a staffer of Mr Holding was squarely aimed at garnering as many votes as possible in electorates with Aboriginal people. That is my own view. There was the push away from a federalist approach to land rights, the national land rights push, and the promises to take over land in Queensland-all of us know the sequence of events. It was the Labor Party that moved away and adopted policies which were simply beyond those which could be accepted on our side of politics because we believed them to be fundamentally flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The serious point I make in response to the chiding, if you like, to the concerns which are in many cases genuine and serious from the other side of the chamber about conflict in this area, is that we have to get away from the theatre. Senator Collins should not worry about issues such as removing Aboriginality from services-that is rubbish. We are trying to recapture the sort of spirit of present High Court judge Mr Justice John Toohey when he was an Aboriginal legal service solicitor in the north west of Western Australia. He was leader of the Western Australian Bar working for the legal service in the north-west of Western Australia. He is a great example of the sort of thing we want to encourage. He said, `I insist that I must be able to work for both the black and the white community. I insist on that because otherwise it will cause ill will.' That is the spirit which motivates our movement of policy towards a greater integration of services. It is not, as Senator Collins has suggested, an attempt to brutally remove the Aboriginal element of service delivery. That would be foolish and backward looking and it is certainly no part of the agenda that I would support. We have had too little of the sort of spirit that was demonstrated by the now Hon. Mr Justice Toohey, then John Toohey, QC, which represented, I think, the best of the sort of bipartisanship, integration and positive approaches which we need to get back into Aboriginal affairs. That is what this debate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever Government speakers might say, we believe the situation is totally unsatisfactory. It has to be changed. I appeal at the end of this debate for some thought on the Government benches instead of the abuse and response that we so often get. I commend the motion. It is quite wrong of the Senate to accept a situation where it can be given inaccurate information with impunity. If we accept that in our vote now we will weaken the operation of democracy in this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only one copy here. I will table it. I also table the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Bill. As I said, the document is a summary of the working papers that were used by Treasury in working out the cost estimates. I want to correct one error. Yesterday Senator Cook and I were both here when this matter was being discussed. Senator Cook had dealt with one question and I had dealt with another. Acting on the advice of the official who was here at the time and who should be here again shortly, I said that no attempt had been made to net out of the revenue estimates the losses through imputation. That is not correct. The official who was here was not working on the estimates himself. He was also under a misapprehension. As the document that I have now tabled makes very clear, it was assumed that two-thirds of the dividends that had been paid in the past went to tax exempt institutions, that is, either to foreign shareholders or to superannuation funds. So one-third of the notional dividend imputation loss has been included. The net figure after that and after the carry forward of exploration deductions and undeducted capital expenditure is $70m for 1990-91 and $300m in a full year. It would probably take a couple of years to build up to that because of the undeducted capital expenditures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The document also notes, however, that because there is no record of goldmining companies' notional taxable incomes, as no tax has been levied, there is possibly more uncertainty about this than there is with estimates of the revenue yields from various measures that have been introduced in the past. However, I think it is worth noting, as I said yesterday, that the estimates which the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury have made in the past of revenue yields from various taxation measures-at least every one that I can remember in the last three or four years-have been demonstrated to have been conservative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are awaiting copies of the figures that have just been tabled to be provided to honourable senators I would like to take up a couple of other issues so that we can deal with them in advance of the consideration of the other issue. First of all, during the debate both last night and this morning Senator Walsh repeatedly stated that one of the major reasons for introducing the gold tax was the higher level of foreign ownership and the leakage of taxation to foreign countries, in particular to the United States of America. In the course of those remarks the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) constantly referred to the level of foreign ownership and it being about 36 per cent of the goldmining industry. I have it on authority that that is not correct. In fact, the foreign equity interest in 1987 in goldmining companies in this country was only 18 1/2 per cent-half the level that the Minister has been speaking of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is significant in the course of this debate because, quite frankly, the Minister has hung his only argument on the basis of moneys going overseas to foreign governments rather than being paid to Australian governments as a result of goldmining operations in this country. That has been the only economic justification for the introduction of the gold tax. Nowhere in the May economic statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and nowhere in any subsequent statement by any Minister-certainly not in the second reading speech of this Bill-has any economic reason been advanced for the introduction of a gold tax, except that foreign governments may be the recipients of a tax benefit. We now find that the figures that have been thrown around this place for several weeks are in fact wrong and are indicating about double the real truth of the situation with regard to foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reiterate that that information has been provided by the Newmont mining company and provides a different perspective to this question altogether. The information-and I have had this matter checked-that the Minister appears to be working from has figures on foreign equity ownership some four years old. They stem from the Bureau of Mining Economics. That information, being so old, of course fails to take into account the enormous growth in the goldmining industry in the last several years. We all know that there has been a rapid increase in both employment and the number of companies searching for gold in this country. In fact, the centrepiece of our argument here last night and this morning was that the industry is growing so rapidly, employing far more people, exporting more gold overseas and generating more export revenue for this country, and that, therefore, there have been significant economic benefits to the country. Yet the Government wants to stop in its tracks that economic development. The Government should look again at its only argument on economic benefit stemming from goldmining profits being channelled off overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook, in the course of his remarks last night, which, of course, as we all know, were thoroughly confused and uninformed, repeatedly stated that the gold price was of the order of $520 and compared that with the cost of running goldmines in this country-about $300 an ounce. According to Senator Cook, he was inferring that there was a clear profit for goldmining operations in this country of something like $200 an ounce. It is remarkable that Senator Cook, who is the Minister for Resources, is so out of touch with his portfolio that he does not realise that gold has been selling below $A500 per ounce in the last several weeks. In fact, today's quote is $484. That has been consistently the pattern over the last several weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to mention-and this again emerged last night through the questioning of Senator Panizza and, I think, Senator Watson-is that the costs of financing the operations of goldmining companies, that is, the costs of borrowing money, the costs of installing plant and the costs of insuring that the operations go forward, amount to at least another $100 an ounce. We are talking of maximum profits of something less than $100 an ounce for goldmining, compared with the Government's overstatement and total exaggeration of something like $200 per ounce. In other words, again the Government's economic justification for the whole basis of this presentation of a new gold tax has fallen to the ground, both on the grounds of foreign taxes being absorbed by the United States and, of course, on the grounds that it has overstated the profitability anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wanted to mention was that Senator Walsh repeatedly stated in the course of his remarks last night that mines operating in the country already have factored into their original cost estimates, in order to evaluate the viability of a particular project, a tax rate of 49 per cent, being the rate of corporate taxation that would apply from now on if this Bill were passed and became law. Quite clearly, that statement is wrong. Companies have repeated publicly-and I would like to mention some of the names of those companies in a moment in particular to the Gutman Inquiry into the Taxation of Gold Mining, although the Chairman has not got a record of it, that, if a goldmining tax had applied at the time they had made the investment decision to proceed with their construction plans, based on the information available at the time the mines would not have been developed. Let me just note some of those mines: Kidston, Mount Leesham, Red Dome, Temora, and Stawell, which is the biggest mine in Victoria. Those mines are some of the examples of mines which would not have proceeded had there been any indication that a gold tax of 49 per cent would be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> There is clear evidence of the fact that the industry is based very marginally on its taxation situation. We have put down in the course of the debate last night figures that showed that the income of goldmining companies had quadrupled in four years. Export earnings have quadrupled in four years. Employment in the industry has jumped from about 3,500 to about 7,500 in the course of the last four years. Where then is the economic justification for the imposition of the tax? I say that particularly seriously because it is demonstrated time and again from the figures that my colleagues and I have cited and have provided to the Minister in the course of the debate-and these figures have been provided by reputable analysts and consultants who are chartered accountants with professional ethics in the industry-that the Government would have lost $363m in tax revenue in the four months to June of this year had a tax applied in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the consequence of what the Government is now entering into. It is entering a period in which it will impose a tax to destroy, or stop the further development of, the goldmining industry in this country. It is something that ought to be refused by the Committee. I hope that the Australian Democrats will see fit to support the amendments which we have put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister replies this document was prepared today, yet for months and months the Government has been quoting a figure of a saving of $300m. It has arrived at this figure purely as a figment of the imagination. This document has proved today that the information provided yesterday by Senator Cook and Senator Walsh was quite false in two major areas: what was quoted last night was that $300m was a gross figure. The document before us today reveals the $300m to be some sort of a net figure. What we really need to know is on what basis of revenue, or what price of gold per ounce, was the $300m arrived at. These are the sorts of calculations we need; not just an imaginary figure which one can sell to the electorate regardless of substantiation. What we are seeking today is an arithmetical substantiation of the $300m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning I said that the arithmetic was not only wrong but incomplete. I also said that the Minister prided himself on economic rationality. The Minister has the resources, through the Treasury, to make calculations, rationalist assumptions, on a far better basis than has been presented to this Committee tonight. The Minister should go back to the Treasury and do the sums properly, otherwise this gold tax is being sold to the Australian people on a false basis. We could well find that the gold tax is going to cost the Treasury a substantial amount of money, rather than be a cost benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe this Committee has been satisfied by the presentation of a documentary explanation, which has been prepared in five hours today, purely to justify a figure which cannot be substantiated and has no rational or economic basis. We need to know on what basis this document was prepared. In the calculation of that figure, we would require information such as the exchange rate which is applicable in relation to the price of gold. After all, gold is our No. 3 export earner and is likely to slide down the scale very considerably if this legislation is passed today, having a chronic effect on our balance of payments. That is pertinent information. What was the basis of the exchange rate? When was it prepared-three months ago, or four months ago? I do not believe that was even calculated. We need to know the price per ounce of gold. </PARA>
<PARA> In this document which has been presented before us today, the Government does not even recognise the fact of the current funding arrangements for the industry. Is the Minister aware of the gold loan system and the impact that this legislation will have on the gold loan system? In this document before us, what has been made of the changes that will inevitably arise from equity debt? We know every banker in Australia will not accept the interest rate in future that is currently available on this arrangement, if we introduce a tax factor. We have not even been told the tax rate which will apply. In these calculations we have not recognised the fact that gold has a higher exploration cost when it moves into phase 2. As the mining operations become deeper, one runs into sulphide problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of concern was that raised by Senator Messner. The whole basis of Senator Walsh selling this to the Australian public is a huge amount of money which is flowing principally to the United States in the form of tax-free dividends. Senator Walsh misled this Committee on the quantum; he misled this Committee as to the foreign equity. Will he retract that now?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will not. Why then did he previously say that the figure was substantially higher than 18.3 per cent? In other words, the information that he is getting is quite dishonest, because if one looks at the figures which are available through government, the foreign owned element is 18.35 per cent. That figure is substantially below the one which has been touted around this place by Senator Walsh. In two principal areas the honourable senator has misled this Committee. It is not his usual practice to mislead this Committee in such a fundamental and significant way. In his determination to socialise this whole issue, he is going to wreck a major industry. He has not done his sums. He has sold us on a falsehood. I ask him to come back and give us the basis of this written explanation, because that is all it is-an inadequate written explanation. The figures are false and I believe that the day will come when it will be proved that the whole issue was based on a false, misleading and dishonest hypothesis.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure that anybody on the Opposition side who is to speak, or has some interest, in this particular Bill would have no hesitation in declaring his interest if he spoke on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. There are so many indirect investment vehicles these days. Quite clearly it is an impossible task, but if people do speak on this matter, they have a duty to declare their interest. I believe all the Liberal and National senators would do so. This paper, which has been put down as some kind of explanation of the calculation of $300m worth of gains to the Commonwealth as a result of this tax, deserves absolute condemnation. It is so sketchy in its outline that we might as well have relied upon the Hansard from last night, for all the value that it adds to the debate. There is certainly nothing new here. I do not know what is wrong with the Treasury, but if it takes five hours for it to produce a document like this, it ought to go back to school and learn mathematics. The first entirely relevant point about it, which really brings it down in pieces, is the statement at the foot of the document. This statement was made after the determination of the $300m figure, which it was estimated would be flowing to the revenue in 1992-93. The paper states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The above figures do not take into account the capital gains tax that might otherwise have been payable on sale of goldmining shares because of the difficulties involved in making a reliable estimate. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like the Australian Democrats to listen to this point particularly because this is the critical issue at stake in the debate about whether to have a gold tax. The fact is that the industry has been growing rapidly. It has been employing people--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. The fact is that the industry has been growing rapidly and employing more Australians for the benefit of all Australians. At the same time the value of goldmining shares has risen dramatically on the stock market. As a result, there have been profits made upon which tax has been paid to the Commonwealth. In fact, the estimate which we quoted last night, and which I will quote again for the benefit of the Government, shows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the period from March 1 to 30 June 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>this has been produced by Ernst and Whinney, a reputable firm of chartered accountants-</PARA>
<PARA>the estimated capital gains tax upon the share trading profits of goldmining companies is $760m. </PARA>
<PARA>That compares with the Government's estimate of a mere $300m which it says it will receive some time in the future if this tax is introduced. The point is that the government is going to stop the development of this industry. That means it will not get that capital gains tax in the future. It will have a net loss in its revenue as a result. The statement that has just been tabled admits that very point. It says quite clearly, as I have just quoted, that the Government has not taken into account the capital gains tax that it earns from the sale of shares. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, it goes the other way around. If there is a net loss, the Government will have to be shelling it out. I hope that the Democrats have taken that point on board because it fundamentally destroys the Government's argument about a justification for a gold tax. It destroys it because in the future it will have no revenue coming from this new tax. In the meantime it will have destroyed the potential to increase the income flowing to this nation by way of export of gold. It will have destroyed new job opportunities for goldminers in the more remote parts of Australia. It will have destroyed the extra income that will flow for the benefit of all Australians through more production in the gold industry, and the net revenue of the Government will have fallen about $400m, and not risen. That is the essence of the argument we stand on. I hope that the Democrats will change their minds and decide to support the Liberal and National parties on this very important issue so that we can defeat--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that they are not going to support us, so the Government is in the clear. It looks as though they will not accept the arguments that we put. These are perfectly rational arguments and I plead again with the Democrats to acknowledge that nowhere has the Government said in any publication how it justifies the economic value of imposing a tax on gold. Nowhere has it defended that. As I said last night, out of 19 speakers on the Bill last night there were 16 from the Liberal and National parties, two from the Democrats and only one who was prepared to get up from the Labor Party to defend the Government's Bill. That is the essence of the question. The Government is not prepared to defend the undefendable. We, on the other hand, are trying to press the point and hope that the Democrats will see the truth and force of our argument so that what is an outrageous piece of legislation, designed to destroy free enterprise in this country, will be defeated and consequently lead to a further growth of expansion of job opportunities in the goldmining industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to try to get an answer to a question from the two Ministers at the table, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook). I asked the question last night and still have not got an answer. I asked whether there was any income from dividends that went to foreign countries out of gold companies that would have been netted by the two-way taxation agreement. I believe that at present the United States rate is 15 per cent. I have not had an answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the explanation given to me I was told that the distribution of dividend income derived by non-resident shareholders and superannuation funds was assumed to be about two-thirds of total dividends, with a third going to taxable residents in Australia. If only 18 per cent-if that figure is correct-of Australian goldmining shares are owned overseas, I take it that 48 per cent is owned by superannuation funds. I also presume that the dividends-the Minister should tell me if I am wrong-that would have been received by superannuation funds were not taxed. If they were not, I put it to the Minister that he is not really after the foreign shareholders but he is after the superannuation funds. If that is the case, I would certainly like the Democrats to take note of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the existing taxation arrangements, having shares in a goldmining company would earn the superannuation funds no greater tax advantage because there are no franked dividends. The dividend withholding tax applied to foreigners, whether the foreign shareholder is a corporate identity or an individual, is 15 per cent. Of course, they may pay more than 15 per cent in their country of origin, under the double taxation agreements. I mentioned that last night. It was suggested at one stage that we should try to renegotiate the double taxation agreement with the United States of America, which would probably take a very long time. If I were an American representing the United States Government and were asked to bend over backwards and write something irrational into a double taxation agreement because there was some crazy tax system in Australia that taxed some industries and not others, I would tell the Australian officials to go away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The price of gold assumed for the costing exercise was $A550 an ounce. That is more than the present gold price and the present exchange rate. It is not so vastly removed. It may prove to be in six months time more accurate than the present price if that was to be taken as the base. This document that was tabled today was prepared some time ago. I expected that the Senate would return to this Bill at 3 o'clock this afternoon. I did not know about the censure motion at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to assertions or claims that were made by a firm of accountants, Senator Messner referred to the Gutman inquiry. There was one incident in the Gutman inquiry. I cannot remember who the witness was but there was an exchange between Mr Gutman and the witness, if that is the right term. Mr Gutman intervened and said, `Are you saying that there is no theoretical price for gold at which the industry could not afford to pay tax?'. The answer was no. That gives honourable senators a pretty good indication of the calibre of the evidence that was presented by some people to the Gutman inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this filibuster has gone on quite long enough. The parliamentary process and the institution are being abused. There was a previous agreement between the Whips to proceed with the privacy legislation and then these taxation Bills. As a courtesy, as a concession to the Opposition, we agreed on the spur of the moment to change that back again and bring these Bills on so that Senator Messner, who is not going to be here tomorrow, could participate in the debate tonight. I regard that as an abuse not only of the parliamentary institution but also of the courtesy which the Government extended to the Opposition in conflict with the previous agreement which had been reached between the Whips. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned previously, this is not the document which was requested by the Committee earlier today. I think the Committee is entitled to receive what it asks for or what it demands. Seeing that we are not getting what we asked for, I think we are entitled to ask whether this document is the product of the Department of the Treasury or whether it came from the office of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). If it is an untouched document of the Department of the Treasury, it shows a severe lack of professionalism within that Department and surely must be a signal to all Australians of the lack of professionalism and the fallibility of some of the top advisers to the present Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are unhappy about the composition of the document. We are extracting information little by little. We now find that this legislation has been put forward on the basis of the price of gold being $550 per ounce. We know that today the figure is substantially lower than that. It is probably closer to $484 per ounce. So the figure is not based on conservatism but on optimism in order to sell the gold tax proposal to the Australian community. Not only has this Government not sold this gold tax proposal honestly to the Australian people but also it has peddled up to us a number of serious inaccuracies. I will not say that they are deliberate, however, they were revealed in an examination of what is in this document and what was told to us last night. So the credibility of not only the Department of the Treasury but also the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is certainly suspect in relation to what has been put forward. It certainly signals to the Opposition that in future the financial impact documents concerning all legislation must be scrutinised in a much more thorough way than has been done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this document shows that the Government is making a political rather than an economic decision. The document put forward to us today reveals so many errors and issues which have not been adequately canvassed and which have not been taken into account in calculating the so-called net $300m benefit. The whole document and the rationale behind it are suspect and it does no credit to those who prepared it. I believe that there is no justification for the Committee supporting the legislation at this time. </PARA>

Part IV, which is in the original Bill, proposed an amendment to the sales tax law to give effect to a proposal announced by the previous Government on 20 August 1981. That proposal was to ensure that, where overpaid sales tax has been passed on to others, refunds are available only if all persons to whom the tax was passed on have been recompensed. It has become apparent that the proposal would place an unacceptable compliance burden on certain wholesalers and retailers. For that reason, the Government has decided not to proceed with the amendment. That language may be a bit confusing because what I have actually moved is that Part IV of the Bill be left out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal and National parties welcome the Government's change of heart on this matter. It introduced in this Bill a rather stupid measure to which obviously it had not given any proper consideration. Of course, this is another example of the total incompetence of the Hawke-Keating Government when it comes to drawing up legislation. This would have cost industry enormous extra amounts. But it would not only have affected industry; it would have affected consumers directly had it been implemented because it would have imposed very substantial costs upon industry generally. It is estimated that it might have cost as much as $100m extra for consumers had this system of refunds been carried through into legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are very pleased that the Government saw the light. A remarkable change is starting to occur in the Government. It is starting to listen sometimes to appropriate representations, but it has a long way to go before it gets out of the out-of-touch mode that it has fallen into in recent times. But we are pleased to see that the arrogance is melting a little at the edges on this kind of issue. I just want to inquire of the Government whether the amendments that it has now put in this Bill will require the House of Representatives to return next week in order to consent to the amendments put forward by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> As Honourable Senators are aware, the Privileges Resolutions agreed to by the Senate on 25 February 1988 not only provide for the protection of witnesses before Committees, the procedures to be followed by the Committee of Privileges, etc, but also provide a means by which a person who has been referred to in the Senate may make a submission to the President claiming that he or she has been adversely affected by the reference and seeking the publication of an appropriate response. The President is empowered to refer the submission to the Committee of Privileges, if he is satisfied that a reference is justified having regard to certain criteria under Resolution 5 (1). </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 November, the President, having considered such a request from Mr Tony Motion relating to remarks made in this Chamber by the Minister for Finance on 10 November, referred the matter, pursuant to Resolution 5, to the Committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the submission and has recommended that a response agreed to by Mr Motion and the Committee be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this recommendation to the Senate, the Committee is mindful that this is the first time that the Committee has considered a submission under these provisions of the Privileges Resolutions. The Committee wishes to assure the Senate that, given the Committee's appreciation that consideration of this matter will inevitably be taken to be a guide to future cases, the Committee examined with care all the options open to the President, to the Committee and to the Senate itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Having decided to consider the submission under Resolution 5 (3), the Committee took particular note of the provision in Resolution 5 (8) concerning documents to be presented to the Senate pursuant to the Resolution, that is, that a response by a person who makes a submission shall be succinct and strictly relevant to the questions in issue and shall not contain anything offensive in character. </PARA>

<PARA>INCOME SUPPORT FOR THE RETIRED AND THE AGED</PARA>
<PARA>AN AGENDA FOR REFORM</PARA>
<PARA> This report presents the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs' inquiry into Australia's retirement income system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's terms of reference were to inquire and report on existing retirement income systems with particular reference to any changes which may be necessary to ensure equitable and comprehensive income security for Australians of retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA> This Report discusses the development of Commonwealth involvement in this area, highlights both the positive and negative aspects of the present arrangements and makes recommendations for reform where it is most needed. It also presents a model for possible reform of the age pension system. </PARA>
<PARA> In most other Western countries the retirement income needs of the community are met largely through a single, comprehensive system of national superannuation or social insurance. In Australia financial support is provided from two distinct sources: the social security system and the occupational superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has reviewed these two main areas, and has made recommendations aimed at ensuring a more equitable and comprehensive income security system for Australians of retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA> In devising its recommendations the Committee has been conscious, on the one hand, of the need for a system of assistance that is both adequate and fair, and on the other hand, does not place an unmanageable financial burden on the taxpaying community in the long term, especially given the substantially different demographic structure and socio-economic circumstances forecast for the end of the century and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> In its approach to the inquiry, the Committee has adhered to the notion that any review of the present retirement income system should be conducted within the context of the gradual evolutionary process that has characterised its development to date. The Committee has therefore recognised the fact that past experience has shown that where attempts have been made to introduce reforms which have required fundamental shifts away from the basic structure of the present system they have invariably been met with strong opposition from within both parliamentary circles and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes it has adopted a balanced, reasonable and evolutionary approach to reform and that it has done so in a manner which it considers to be economically and financially responsible and which will gain a significant degree of public acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA> In its examination of income support for the aged provided through the Social Security system the Committee has noted that some four-fifths of the aged population currently receive some type of assistance from the Government. Additionally, over half the number of aged people currently derive 90 per cent or more of their income from this source. </PARA>
<PARA> The age and service pension system is openly financed entirely from general revenue. The superannuation system on the other hand is only partially funded by the Commonwealth through the provision of deductions and other tax relief made available to contributors, employers and trustees of funds. These `tax expenditures' represent a substantial cost to the community in terms of revenue forgone and their impact is not generally understood. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987-88 the cost of providing age and service pensions amounted to $8.9 billion. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth of superannuation tax concessions exceeded $3.5 billion for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the generally low level of benefits received by most superannuants, together with the fact that only 8 per cent of the population aged 65 years and over receive any income from superannuation, and less than 5 per cent rely on such benefits as their principal or main source of income in retirement, it is not surprising that a large number of those who contributed to the inquiry questioned the effectiveness of the Government's role in providing financial assistance for the occupational superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite disagreements concerning the amount of financial support provided for superannuation by the Commonwealth Government through taxation expenditure, it is clear that the level of assistance is substantial, currently representing an estimated 39 per cent of the cost of providing income support for the aged through the social security system, a program that supports a significantly larger proportion of the aged population. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee's view the prime objective of superannuation is to encourage self-provision in retirement. The provision of financial assistance in the form of taxation concessions should aim both to reduce dependence on publicly funded income support programs such as the age pension and fulfil an income maintenance function for aged people. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly this system has neither diminished demand for income support provided through the social security system, nor enabled many aged people to maintain their pre-retirement living standards: goals often used by proponents of superannuation to justify continued government support of this form of retirement saving. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has over the past 3 years made a number of changes to superannuation arrangements designed to put superannuation on a more secure long-term footing. The imposition of some vesting and preservation standards in 1986 and new taxation arrangements this year have reduced inequities but the Committee strongly believes that these measures do not go far enough. The Report identifies many problems with present policies, particularly concerning inadequacies relating to the vesting, preservation and portability of many superannuation arrangements and the widespread scope to use such savings for purposes other than to generate retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended the extension of vesting regulation standards to encompass all employer-financed benefits and preservation of all benefits at least until the age of 55. Additionally the Committee recommends that lump sum payments from employer-financed benefits be prohibited and that pension take-up be enforced for this part of a member's entitlement. Lump sum payments from employee financed benefits should continue to remain an option however. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that it is not equitable to provide tax concessional support for personal saving for retirement and then allow such savings to be spent in ways which are not directed towards that end. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for regulating in this area is to overcome the problem created by the large gap between the age of compulsory preservation to age 55 and the age of age pension entitlement, which under the Committee's recommendations would become 65 for both men and women. The likely result is the development of a vast system of early retirement subsidised through occupational superannuation. With an ageing population this will simply not be financially sustainable. While lifting the age of required preservation from 55 to 60 or even 65 is a possible answer, this measure would cut across many schemes now offering the option of retiring at the age of 55. In the Committee's view, a more appropriate approach is to require certain benefits to be paid as a life pension or annuity. This has two distinct effects. One is to prevent the running down of a retirement benefit prior to the receipt of a government pension, and the other is to impose a financial discipline on retirees who must explicitly trade-off their early retirement against the much lower superannuation pension they are likely to receive, compared to working an additional 5-10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of membership eligibility criteria the Committee believes that if an employer chooses to operate a superannuation scheme and in so doing benefits from taxation incentives then membership should be readily available to all classes of employees, including part-time, and recommends the removal of restrictive membership eligibility criteria. Equality between the sexes is also recommended. The Committee asks that the Government repeal certain sections of the Sex-Discrimination Act 1984 to make it unlawful to discriminate on the ground of a person's sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not specifically advocate mandating occupational superannuation at this stage, although it does not exclude the possibility that its use may ultimately be the only way to ensure that the coverage of superannuation becomes sufficiently comprehensive and fair to all employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made recommendations which it believes will not only ensure greater benefit levels in retirement from this source but also lead to a better integration of pension and superannuation provisions for the retired and the aged. Greater integration is necessary to achieve maximum benefit from the large total outlays involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Reliance on the social security system increases with age and is greater for women, particularly older aged women, than for aged men. Furthermore, statistics indicate that single aged people, especially single aged women, are considerably more dependent on social security for their livelihood than married aged couples. </PARA>
<PARA> In this report the Committee examines the validity of the criticism levelled at what many regarded during the inquiry as the unnecessarily restrictive and discriminatory nature of the eligibility criteria governing the availability of pensions for the aged-namely, a person's age, marital status, period of residency within Australia, and possession of income and assets. In terms of age requirements, numerous groups who presented evidence to the Committee argued that the growing acceptance within the community of social and economic equality between men and women meant that it was no longer justifiable to treat aged women more favourably than aged men by granting them financial assistance 5 years earlier than men. It was maintained by others that the application of a differential payment structure whereby pensions are granted at either the married or single rate (depending on a person's marital status) discriminates between married and non-married pensioners, especially since the latter are often able to share accommodation and other associated living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee assesses the adequacy of current income arrangements for the aged and makes recommendations to improve the level of age and service pensions and rent assistance and broaden access to pensioner fringe benefits. The Committee also reviews the current indexation arrangements for pensions and the taxation treatment of pensioners and makes recommendations for improvements in both of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends changes to the age qualifications for age and service pensions and the rate of pension payment in relation to marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> It examines the inequities and anomalies in the present means testing of pensions and makes recommendations for the inclusion of the owner-occupied home in the assets test and a widening of access to the Pension Loans Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee identifies the need for fundamental structural changes to the present age pension system and considers various reform options. A proposal is put forward for a two-tiered pension system which at one level, would provide a flat-rate, non-means-tested entitlement to all aged people and, at another level, would provide a tightly means-tested income supplement to those in particular need who are unable to supplement their income in retirement and old age from other sources. The proposal is presented in the form of a discussion paper and, as such, is intended to indicate the possibilities for reform, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of meeting the income support needs of the retired and the aged through a two-tiered pension system rather than the present single-tiered system. The Committee believes the need for reform in this area is an important issue and one that will acquire increasing prominence over time as the population ages. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only highlighted the major points and recommendations presented in this report. It contains a much more comprehensive discussion of the issues and it points the way towards a more adequate, equitable and cost-efficient retirement income system for all. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the report is timely in the light of recent releases of issues papers, discussion papers and policy statements on the subject and that it will add considerably to policy development in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I would like to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry, those who gave evidence, and all others who assisted the Committee in the presentation of this report. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 March 1988 the Senate referred the following matter to the Standing Committee on Transport Communications and Infrastructure:</PARA>
<PARA>The adequacy of international terminal and aircraft handling facilities at Sydney Airport having regard to projected increases in passenger traffic through that airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 42 submissions, inspected the airport on 15 June and held public hearings in Sydney on 13 and 14 July and in Canberra on 26 September. Fifty-three witnesses appeared before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is Australia's major international airport with more overseas visitors arriving there than in all our other international airports combined. The airport plays a strategic role in the New South Wales and Australian economies as a hub for tourism, domestic aviation, commercial activity and cargo. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of total arrival passenger movements, Sydney Airport in 1986 with 10m passengers was ranked 36th out of 473 on the world airport listings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received considerable evidence criticising various facilities at the airport and these criticisms are examined in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to focus on two of these criticisms. These are</PARA>
<PARA> the capacity of the international terminal building; and</PARA>
<PARA> the capacity of the airport to handle aircraft movements. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the construction of the international terminal building in 1970, the number of international passenger movements has increased markedly from one million in 1971 to 3.65 million passengers in 1987. The number of transit passengers has also increased significantly. These increases have placed severe operational constraints on the terminal building. </PARA>
<PARA> During the inquiry, the Committee was told that these constraints now result in massive passenger and public inconvenience, aircraft delays and long queues for passengers awaiting services at key processing points. One witness likened the terminal to a `broken down cattle-yard'. Other witnesses emphasised the adverse effects of the terminal on tourism and consequent ramifications on the Australian economy in general. </PARA>
<PARA> The criticisms of the facilities at the international terminal were so strident, it is not surprising that the Committee also concluded that the terminal is inadequate. The Committee also formed the view that even with the current $38 million program of improvements, the terminal would not be able to cope with conservative forecasts of passenger growth. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 November 1988, the Public Works Committee in a report to the Parliament recognised the urgent need to expand the terminal and recommended expansion and improvements amounting to $214m. This Committee endorses the PWC's recommendations and welcomes the Government's acceptance of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major criticism presented to the Committee concerned the capacity of the airport to handle aircraft movements. Several witnesses maintained that the airport, particularly at peak periods was unable to cope adequately with the demands of international, domestic, commuter and general aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> This resulted in congestion and delays to arrivals and departures. Australian Airlines told the Committee that in 1987 delays resulting from congestion at Sydney Airport involved more than 1600 hours at a cost to the airline of $8.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> Various aviation and tourism organisations argued that these problems would be alleviated by the construction of an additional runway at Sydney Airport to be used by smaller aircraft up to F27 size. Other witnesses who appeared before the Committee were opposed to any expansion of the airport and in particular the construction of an additional runway, especially into Botany Bay. These witnesses maintained that an expansion of this kind would exacerbate existing social, environmental and ecological problems. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's inquiry, the then Minister for Transport and Communications announced that Badgerys Creek would be built as Sydney's second airport and that a submission would be put to Cabinet seeking commencement of work during 1989. The first phase of this development would involve the construction of a substantial General Aviation facility that could be operational by 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the Minister's announcement on a phased development of Badgerys Creek, the Committee's view is that the construction of an additional runway at Sydney Airport would duplicate an essential element of the Badgerys Creek initiative and would not be cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister's proposal is not accepted by Cabinet, the Committee believes that the option of an additional runway at Sydney Airport should not be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> Forecasts indicate that Sydney Airport will need to cope with increasing passenger and aircraft traffic. In this report the Committee identifies various options to assist passenger processing and air traffic demand management and draws these to the attention of the Federal Government authorities with responsibilities at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that this report is one of several studies on the airport needs of the Sydney area. The issues involved are complex and technical. Nevertheless, the Committee believes that it is essential that those authorities empowered to operate Sydney Airport continue to monitor the airport's operations and standard of facilities to ensure that if changes are required they are implemented promptly and in full consultation with all parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee extends its gratitude to all those people who assisted it in the course of this inquiry. </PARA>

In respect of new products I am advised that a chemical is being tested by the appropriate authorities in the United States. The Australian Government recently established a code for the registration of chemicals and any new products will have to meet the requirements of the code before being used in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Research into the development of alternative products or technologies which meets the appropriate criteria will be eligible for support from the Government's R and D and GIRD schemes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Only 3 agencies within the Industry, Technology and Commerce portfolio made borrowings. They are the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE) and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC).</PARA>
<PARA> AIDC is a financial enterprise, operating on commercial principles and as such operates a continuous borrowing strategy which is directed towards achieving the most economical use of funds. AIDC's borrowings are used, in the same way as other financial intermediaries, in making loans and other investments in Australian industrial concerns. During 1986-87 and 1987-88 the net increase in borrowings of AIDC was $264 million and $27 million respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE undertook borrowings in 1986-87 and 1987-88 of nil and $442.4 million respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> SMEC has in place commercially prudent borrowing arrangements (for an organisation of its type). Last year infrequent and only limited drawdowns of these facilities occurred. The details are commercial in confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1986-87 the net increase in AIDC overseas borrowings was $603 million (ie offset by a net decrease in on-shore borrowings). In 1987-88 the net decrease in AIDC overseas borrowings was $7 million (ie offset by a net increase in on-shore borrowings).</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE undertook overseas borrowings of $343 million for 1987-88 only.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) AIDC operates actively in the foreign exchange market and its exposure to any foreign currency fluctuation is virtually eliminated by various hedging techniques. That is, AIDC maintains a virtually balanced book in each currency and exchange gains or losses are minimal.</PARA>
<PARA> AUSTRADE covers itself against exchange rate fluctuations by borrowing in the same currency in which it lends to overseas borrowers under its Export Finance Facility. Where foreign currency borrowings are used for other than Export Finance loans (ie funding of major credit insurance claims) exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is avoided by using hedge instruments where appropriate (eg forwards market if claims paid in A$).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I wrote to Mr Newman on 14 September 1987 advising him that the Government supported the commercial exploitation of Australian innovations and referred him to the National Industry Extension Service (NIES) for advice and assistance. In the event of a need for further research and development (R&amp;D) of the product, Mr Newman was provided with information brochures on the Government's Industry Research and Development incentive schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, Mr Newman was advised that high-growth businesses, which have the potential to be export-oriented, may be given equity funding and management support by Management Investment Companies (MICs).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No, my Department advised Mr Newman on 21 December 1987 that, given the limit on the tax revenue which the Government forgoes each year, the difficult equity raising task then facing existing MICs and the need for the MICs to support existing investments, the Management and Investment Companies Licensing Board decided not to call for new MIC licences in 1987 and was unlikely to do so in 1988. Mr Newman, however, was advised that as a potential eligible business, he may consider it appropriate to approach any of the licensed MICs. Mr Newman had also made inquiries on assistance for research and development and was subsequently provided with detailed information on the Government's IR&amp;D incentives schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Industry Research and Development Board considered Mr Newman's application for a discretionary grant and formed the view that the project did not rank sufficiently high against the scheme's selection criteria as other applications considered for the allocation of the funds available.</PARA>
