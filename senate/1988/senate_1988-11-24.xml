<TITLE>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That it be recognised the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill is a public, legal acknowledgement that Australians who are non-aboriginal do not have sovereignty in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the Australian people are opposed to the idea of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Australian people who are non-aboriginal and those who are aboriginal, and the Government has no mandate or authority to pursue it.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the proposed legislation and treaty</PARA>
<PARA> will damage Australia's position under international law and in any conflict,</PARA>
<PARA> will cause distrust and conflict between our aboriginal population (1%) and the non-aboriginal population (99%),</PARA>
<PARA> will extend aboriginal land rights, contrary to the wishes of the Australian people,</PARA>
<PARA> will not be acceptable to the aboriginal people themselves,</PARA>
<PARA> will solve none of the problems of aboriginal people who need housing, health services, education and employment.</PARA>
<PARA> That therefore, the Senate reject absolutely the announced proposals for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, and the negotiation of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Commonwealth and aboriginal people.</PARA>

I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a summary of the Committee's scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The summary read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Education (Amendment) Ordinance 1988 as contained in Australian Capital Territory Ordinance No. 48 of 1988 and made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance makes a number of amendments, including provisions prescribing periods of notification for commencement of schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the impossibility of meeting the specified periods of 9 months and 21 months notice required for the commencement of schools in the years 1989 and 1990 respectively, possibly due to the delay in making the Ordinance. The Committee sought advice on the inclusion in the Ordinance of relevant periods which could not be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P., acknowledged delay in the making of the Ordinance, and indicated that should any further applications be received which are adversely affected by the Ordinance, favourable consideration would be given to approving a lesser period than the prescribed period. The Committee considered this undertaking accepted and the advice provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Electricity and Water Ordinance 1988 as contained in Australian Capital Territory Ordinance No. 30 of 1988 and made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance establishes the ACT Electricity and Water Authority and designates its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to laying of information before Parliament on the Authority's business activities but without formal provisions as to tabling and disallowance, and powers of entry and search given to authorised persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding MP, undertook to amend the Ordinance to provide for Parliamentary scrutiny of the Authority's business activities through disclosure in the Annual Report. The Committee accepted the Minister's undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's position regarding power of entry and search given to authorised persons reflects its fundamental concern that delegated legislation does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties (Principle (b)). Indeed, similar, but less onerous provisions in the Electricity (Amendment) Ordinance 1985 were subject to correspondence between the then Chairman and the then Minister before the provisions were finally repealed in 1987 (Electricity (Amendment) Ordinance 1987.)</PARA>
<PARA> In the present situation, the Electricity and Water (Amendment) Ordinance 1988, No. 57 of 1988 repealed the provision covering the powers the Committee considered onerous and a breach of individual rights and liberties. The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation (Buildings Control) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1988 No. 161 and made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This regulation largely remakes the repealed Air Navigation (Building Control) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the lack of criteria to determine compensation payable for certain losses, damage or expenses in section 14, and lack of proof of identity of authorised persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support undertook to bring forward further statutory rules to ensure proof of identity. The Committee accepted this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was not satisfied with the Minister's original response that it was sufficient that a claimant could seek compensation through the courts. The Chairman wrote again seeking to remedy shortcomings by insertion in section 14 of criteria for compensation similar to those in section 13. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in response indicated that he would seek an amendment at an early date to include entitlements to reasonable compensation and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Marine Order No. 4, Part 6 (Marine Qualifications-Radio) of 1988, made pursuant to the Navigation (Orders) Regulations made under the Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This order reissues the Order relating to persons qualified to operate radio installations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the definition of ``Minister'' and ``Secretary'', and a penal provision with no defence. </PARA>
<PARA>Marine Order No. 5, Part 9 (Health-Medical Fitness) of 1988, made pursuant to the Navigation (Orders) Regulations made under the Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Order sets out the criteria for establishing medical fitness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to discretionary powers relating to the Medical Inspector of Seamen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support the Hon. Bob Brown, MP, explained that the discretions were not unfettered powers, but were intended to clarify certain matters. As to general review provisions, it was intended to include a list of decisions subject to appeal in each Part of Marine Orders. The Minister explained, to the Committee's satisfaction, the matters of definition of ``Minister'' and ``Secretary'' and discretions given to the Medical Inspector of Seamen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Export Control (Fees) Orders as amended (Amendment), as contained in Export Control Orders No. 10 of 1988 and made under the Export Control (Orders) Regulations made under the Export Control Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These Orders provide for fees associated with the introduction of a fee for service and for revised charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern related to whether `proportionately' referred to mathematical calculations of a proportion of the normal fee or whether it referred to a discretion being given to fix proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources advised that `proportionately' refers to mathematical calculations to reduce the fee by the amount that would normally be payable for the time inspection services were not available. The Committee accepts the advice of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Marine Order No. 3, Part 3 (Seagoing Qualifications) of 1988, made pursuant to the Navigation (Orders) Regulations made under the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Order repeals and replaces the Orders relating to seagoing qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to a number of discretionary decisions, general review provisions, and delegation without restriction on the level to which powers may be delegated. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Amendment Bill is part of the first stage of legislative amendments to implement the Government's reform package for Telecom, as announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988-``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms to Government Business Enterprises are central to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructure of the public sector. In the present difficult and fiercely competitive international trading environment public sector efficiency is especially important. Many public business enterprises-particularly those in the Transport and Communications portfolio-produce not only final goods and services for the consumer, but also provide intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, and thus influence the nation's overall cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, the Whitlam Labor Government took the bold step of creating from the Post-Master General's Department the two major public enterprises, Telecom and Australia Post. Time has proven the correctness of that decision. Australia has a technically advanced and highly reliable telephone service. The telephone network has continued to expand and now well over ninety per cent of Australian households have a telephone service. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the increasing importance of telecommunications to our economy necessitates further building on the achievements to-date. Consequently, the Government has decided to continue the process of commercialisation by adopting a reform package which will put Telecom on a sounder commercial footing. Key elements in these reforms are that the Australian Telecommunications Commission will become the Australian Telecommunications Corporation, with a Board of directors, and with a new financial structure and new accountability mechanisms. A myriad of unnecessary Government controls over day-to-day management decision making will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> In future the Government will be less involved in scrutinising the day-to-day activities of Telecom. Instead, it will focus on planning, through corporate plans and financial targets, and accountability for results with strategic aspects monitored on an on-going basis. The emphasis in future will be on the bottom line, on how successfully the goals and targets are met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims, through this approach, to establish a clearer distinction between the ownership of the enterprise, the Board and management.</PARA>
<PARA> The reform process requires extensive legislative and administrative changes. Legislation will be implemented in two stages. This Amendment Bill represents the first stage. It provides for the change of name to Corporation and the establishment of the Board, new employment provisions, and removal of day-to-day controls. </PARA>
<PARA> A second Bill (proposed for passage in the Autumn sittings 1989, and to operate from 1 July 1989) will remake the Telecommunications Act 1975 as the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act 1989, redefine the objectives, functions and powers of the Corporation, and provide for the corporate planning and financial accountability measures. The second Bill will be a companion to a further Bill to provide for new regulatory arrangements for the telecommunications industry in Australia as announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May, ``Australian telecommunications services: a new framework''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate provides for the constitution of the Board, including a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and Managing Director and up to six other Directors. Board members are to be appointed by the Governor-General and will be subject to dismissal for on-going under-performance (in addition to current grounds such as misbehaviour, mental illness etc.), in line with the emphasis on accountability for results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director will be appointed by the portfolio Minister after receiving a recommendation from the Board. Terms and conditions of employment for the Managing Director will be a matter for the Board. The Board will consult with the Remuneration Tribunal about the remuneration package for the Managing Director in line with the amendment of the Remuneration Tribunals Act introduced in the Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Bill (Part V). The Board's most important function will be to formulate policy directions for the Corporation, in accordance with the Act and any directions from the Minister. The Managing Director will have the responsibility, under the Board, for managing the affairs of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The change from Commission to Corporation does not change the status of Telecom as a statutory corporation and rights under contract are not affected. The Telecom Board will be a new and separate corporate entity and the Bill takes account of the need for continuation of such matters as delegations. All the provisions dealing with the change of name and the Board will come into operation from a date to be proclaimed, likely to be 1 January 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment provision in the current Act will be replaced by simpler provisions which make the Board responsible for determining terms and conditions of employment. Telecom is currently consulting staff associations on how existing terms and conditions will be dealt with in awards or by the Board. As this process could take some time, the new employment provisions will be subject to a special proclamation date. The Government will not proclaim these changes until it is satisfied that the interests of Telecom employees are protected and existing terms and conditions are preserved on change-over. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects Telecom to make satisfactory arrangements, including issuing Board determinations as necessary, to ensure that no current staff member loses any entitlement, classification or other term and condition of employment on transfer to the Corporation. Also, the Government has taken the additional step of including within the Bill provisions for continuity of employment for all current staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows for day-to-day Government controls to be minimised in line with the enhanced responsibilities of the Board. There will be appropriate mechanisms to allow the Minister to exercise strategic oversight, through the corporate plan and financial targets. These are currently being developed and will be provided for in the second stage legislation, once necessary asset revaluations are completed to provide for the new financial structure on which targets will be based. Telecom will be free to engage, on its own authority, in such standard business practices as entering into contracts, partnerships, joint ventures, and normal business investment arrangements. In some cases, such as establishing subsidiary companies, the Board will be required to notify the Minister in writing before business activities are expanded. Subject to overall Loan Council scrutiny, Telecom will not be required to obtain Ministerial approval to the Terms and conditions of individual borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the regulatory measures announced in the Government's statement ``Australian telecommunications: a new regulatory framework'' the private sector will be permitted to carry out maintenance work of PABX from 1 January 1989, in addition to the installation of PABXs currently allowed. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act currently exempts Telecom employees who would otherwise be guilty of interception because of conversations overheard during the course of their work. The Bill extends this exemption to private sector employees lawfully engaged in installation and maintenance of PABX equipment. The provision making it an offence to divulge any information obtained already applies generally to all persons exempted. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill does not involve any additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or, of itself, additional revenue for the Commonwealth. However, improvements in the performance of Telecom that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit the shareholders and all users of Telecom's services. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>POSTAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Postal Services Amendment Bill is part of the first stage of legislative amendments to implement the Government's reform package for Australia Post, as announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988-``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms to Government Business Enterprises are central to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructure of the public sector. In the present difficult and fiercely competitive international trading environment public sector efficiency is especially important. Many public business enterprises-particularly those in the Transport and Communications portfolio-produce not only final goods and services for the consumer, but also provide intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, and thus influence the nation's overall cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, the Whitlam Labor Government took the bold step of creating from the Post Master General's Department the two major public enterprises, Telecom and Australia Post. Time has proven the correctness of that decision. For example, in the 11 years before 1975, the postal operations of the Post Master General's department consistently showed a loss. Since 1975, Post has made a profit in every year but one. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the increasing importance of postal services to our economy necessitates further building on the achievements to-date. Consequently, the Government has decided to continue the process of commercialisation by adopting a reform package which will put Australia Post on a sounder commercial footing. Key elements in these reforms are that the Australian Postal Commission will become the Australian Postal Corporation, with a Board of directors, and with a new financial structure and new accountability mechanisms. A myriad of unnecessary Government controls over day-to-day management decision making will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> In future the Government will be less involved in scrutinising the day-to-day activities of Australia Post. Instead, it will focus on planning, through corporate plans and financial targets, and accountability for results with strategic aspects monitored on an on-going basis. The emphasis in future will be on the bottom line, on how successfully the goals and targets are met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims, through this approach, to establish a clearer distinction between the ownership of the enterprise, the Board and management.</PARA>
<PARA> The reform process requires extensive legislative and administrative changes. Legislation will be implemented in two stages. This Amendment Bill represents the first stage. It provides for the change of name to Corporation and the establishment of the Board, new employment provisions, and removal of day-to-day controls. </PARA>
<PARA> A second Bill (proposed for passage in the autumn sittings 1989, and to operate from 1 July 1989) will remake the Postal Services Act 1975 as the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, redefine the objectives, functions and powers of the Corporation, and provide for the corporate planning and financial accountability measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate provides for the constitution of the Board, including a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and Managing Director and up to six other Directors. Board members are to be appointed by the Governor-General and will be subject to dismissal for on-going under-performance (in addition to current grounds such as misbehaviour, mental illness etc.), in line with the emphasis on accountability for results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Managing Director will be appointed by the portfolio Minister after receiving a recommendation from the Board. Terms and conditions of employment for the Managing Director will be a matter for the Board. The Board will consult with the Remuneration Tribunal about the remuneration package for the Managing Director in line with the amendment of the Remuneration Tribunals Act introduced in the Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Bill (Part V). The Board's most important function will be to formulate policy directions for the Corporation, in accordance with the Act and any directions from the Minister. The Managing Director will have the responsibility, under the Board, for managing the affairs of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The change from Commission to Corporation does not change the status of Australia Post as a statutory corporation and rights under contract are not affected. The Australia Post Board will be a new and separate corporate entity and the Bill takes account of the need for continuation of such matters as delegations. All the provisions dealing with the change of name and the Board will come into operation from a date to be proclaimed, likely to be 1 January 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment provisions in the current Act will be replaced by simpler provisions which make the Board responsible for determining terms and conditions of employment. Australia Post is currently consulting staff associations on how existing terms and conditions will be dealt with in awards or by the Board. As this process could take some time, the new employment provisions will be subject to a special proclamation date. The Government will not proclaim these changes until it is satisfied that the interests of Australia Post employees are protected and existing terms and conditions are preserved on change-over. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects Australia Post to make satisfactory arrangements, including issuing Board determinations as necessary, to ensure that no current staff member loses any entitlement, classification or other term and condition of employment on transfer to the Corporation. Also, the Government has taken the additional step of including within the Bill provisions for continuity of employment for all current staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows for day-to-day Government controls to be minimised in line with the enhanced responsibilities of the Board. There will be appropriate mechanisms to allow the Minister to exercise strategic oversight, through the corporate plan and financial targets. These are currently being developed and will be provided for in the second stage legislation, once necessary asset revaluations are completed to provide for the new financial structure on which targets will be based. Australia Post will be free to engage, on its own authority, in such standard business practices as entering into contracts, partnerships, joint ventures, and normal business investment arrangements. In some cases, such as establishing subsidiary companies, the Board will be required to notify the Minister in writing before business activities are expanded. Subject to overall Loan Council scrutiny, Australia Post will not be required to obtain Ministerial approval to the terms and conditions of individual borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to allow Australia Post to develop its properties commercially. In many cities throughout Australia the Post Office is located in the heart of town. These sites are prime real estate but the existing constraint on Australia Post's powers have inhibited their commercial development. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with Australia Post's assuming responsibility for the telegram service, the Bill recognises that Australia Post's electronic mail services are equivalent to the traditional telegrams that they will replace. </PARA>
<PARA> Lettergrams, like telegrams, will be able to be ordered by telephone or across a Post Office counter and Australia Post will undertake their delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> Transition to these new arrangements is expected to be completed by March next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill does not involve any additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or, of itself, additional revenue for the Commonwealth. However, improvements in the performance of Australia Post that result from the implementation of the reform package, of which this Bill is a part, will benefit the shareholders and all users of Australia Post's services. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES (MISCELLANEOUS REFORMS) BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> The Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Bill 1988 gives effect to the first of what will be a wide-ranging series of measures to reform Government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures reflect the Government's continuing commitment to improving the efficiency of the Federal public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> That commitment was enunciated in the Labor Party's 1983 policy statement, Labor and Quality of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It was reflected in the Government's December 1983 Policy Paper ``Reforming the Australian Public Service'' and again in the ``Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises'' tabled by the Minister for Finance in October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy guidelines established processes for better defining and expressing the objectives which enterprises serve and against which their performance could be evaluated. They also acknowledged the need to reduce the extent of Government controls over their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the guidelines is to devolve responsibility-to let managers manage-with appropriate accountability for results. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, in the 1988 May economic statement, referred to this Government's pursuit of wide-ranging policies directed at improving the operation of domestic markets and the efficiency with which resources are used. As part of this, the Government is conducting fundamental reviews of the principal government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The first results of this task were seen in the statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications on 25 May 1988, ``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''. Under the proposals spelt out in the Minister's statement, the emphasis will be placed on planning and accountability for results. </PARA>
<PARA> Enterprises will be expected to plan in advance their major financial and operational goals and the measures required to achieve them, including the achievement of community service obligations; to work towards pre-set financial targets; and to report on success in meeting those targets and other previously identified performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> Integral to the new arrangements is the clear delineation of responsibilities between the Government as owner/shareholder, the enterprise board and enterprise management. </PARA>
<PARA> The board and management will be largely free of government day-to-day controls to achieve the goals and targets set and agreed to by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The reviews of individual enterprises are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA>Key Elements</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Full details of the Bill are provided in the explanatory memorandum. Here I wish to refer to its most significant features. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes new arrangements for the appointment and remuneration of the chief executives of the Australian Shipping Commission, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Other enterprises will be covered by similar arrangements as their reform proposals are brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Each chief executive is to be appointed by the relevant portfolio Minister after receiving a recommendation from the enterprise board. Consistent with the heightened emphasis on organisational performance and accountability, and commercial practice, chief executives will not have any security of tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> Enterprise boards will determine the terms and conditions of appointment of chief executives. Separate administrative provision will be made requiring boards to consult the Remuneration Tribunal in the course of developing remuneration arrangements, and to advise the Tribunal of the arrangements which they make. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 to enable the Remuneration Tribunal to provide advice to the boards of enterprises. The tribunal will no longer make determinations in respect of the chief executives of the authorities covered by these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> As boards will be responsible for determining remuneration, the Bill provides that each authority will be required to incorporate, in its financial statements, a report on the remuneration of the chief executive consistent with the obligations placed on listed corporations by the Companies Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention is that boards should not be encumbered by Public Service terms and conditions of employment in establishing the remuneration arrangements of chief executives. To this end, the Bill provides that the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 will not apply to the chief executives of these authorities or other enterprises to be covered by these arrangements. Other legislation relating to the terms and conditions of employment of these offices will be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Boards will also be able to establish remuneration arrangements for senior executives consistent with the arrangements for chief executives. </PARA>
<PARA> These remuneration arrangements will also apply to the chief executives of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no considerations for the Budget arising from these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an important initiative in the overall process of the reform of Government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> By enabling boards to recruit managers of high calibre and reward them appropriately, it furthers the Government's commitment to improving the efficiency of these enterprises whilst maintaining standards of public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to provide a new supervisory mechanism for the provision of superannuation benefits to Commonwealth sector employees, in addition to that already available. These changes constitute an integral part of this Government's reforms of Government business enterprises. They will allow certain enterprises to determine their own future superannuation arrangements within guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> This contrasts with the current provisions of the Act. At present, in all instances, the detailed written approval of the Minister for Finance must be obtained before superannuation benefits can be provided to statutory office-holders, employees of statutory authorities and certain Commonwealth-owned companies or Commonwealth-funded bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially the guidelines approach will apply to Qantas, Australian Airlines, the Australian National Line and Aussat. It will enable these enterprises to play a key role in the further development of this nation guided in their actions in relation to superannuation by commercial considerations. It is envisaged that in the future, enterprises such as Telecom, Australia Post, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation will also be able to make their own superannuation arrangements within appropriate guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are an important component of the reform packages, announced in the May economic statement, that will make Government enterprises more accountable for their own performance. Managers of these enterprises will be forced to measure up. At the same time, this Government has not overlooked the public interest in these changes and honourable senators will note how the provisions of the Bill relating to contraventions provide a sufficient deterrent to managers who might seek to exploit unduly their new freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it is intended that enterprises operating under guidelines will be required to publicly report their actions in relation to superannuation as part of their annual reports. This requirement will further enhance the public accountability of the management of Government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also seeks to correct a deficiency in the former provisions. The Act will now fully implement the decision of both this Government and its predecessor, that the Superannuation Act 1976 should be the exclusive source of legal authority on superannuation for Commonwealth sector employees. This approach needs to be modified when the Minister relaxes his control under the guidelines approach. The Bill allows the Industrial Relations Commission to conciliate and arbitrate on their superannuation arrangements. This is consistent with the commercial environment in which the authorities subject to the guidelines are expected to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no direct financial effects resulting from this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> However, to the extent that these amendments facilitate improvements in the rate of return of Government business enterprises, there should be increases in revenue to the Government in the form of increased dividends from these enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT</PARA>
<PARA>CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Government came to office committed to transforming the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) into an effective instrument of industry policy after the previous Government had left the Corporation to languish. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC was moved to the Industry portfolio and in late 1983 the AIDC Act was amended to expand the role of the Corporation. The amendments enabled it to provide finance for the restructuring and revitalisation of industry and for high technology and other growth industries in order to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC responded well, the focus of its investment activities altered significantly, the Corporation engaged in an intense process of self-examination and it emerged revitalised and reorganised with the board and staff determined to make a significant contribution to the Government's industry policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC's ability to provide both loan and equity capital across the spectrum of new and old industries is a key characteristic which differentiates it from other financial institutions. AIDC is now making a solid contribution not only in its day to day business activities but also to the heavy engineering plan, raw materials processing under the textiles, clothing and footwear package and the anti-malaria joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, the Corporation has experienced a period of very strong asset growth, of over 250 per cent, in the four years to 30 June 1987. However, its capital base has emerged as a factor that could jeopardise AIDC's future contribution to industry development especially in terms of its equity investment program, which is essential if it is to make its full contribution to industry policy objectives. At present AIDC has paid up capital of $100 million and $93.6 million in accumulated reserves. However, budgetary circumstances have ensured that additional capital contributions have been the exception rather than the rule. A provision introduced in 1983 requiring the Corporation to pay a dividend of 50 per cent of net profit after tax has also slowed the growth of reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with prudent commercial practice AIDC apportions capital to the various components of its business, appropriate to the risk/return profile of each class of business. This is essential in order to maintain AIDC's credit standing. However, this places a constraint on the level of capital intensive equity investments although they are highly desirable from a policy viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA> Confronted with the capital problem, the Government examined a number of options:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) continue as at present; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide a substantial capital instalment from the Budget; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) raise equity capital from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In evaluating these options it was important to maintain AIDC as an effective financial instrument of industry policy. For this reason option (a) was unacceptable. It would have undermined the progress achieved by AIDC over the last five years returning it to the situation it confronted before this Government came to office. It would also have had a disastrous impact on the morale of the Corporation and its ability to retain key staff. AIDC's loan portfolio would have soon ceased to grow and the investment strategy would increasingly have been determined by the need for short term profitability. New investment in the more innovative and useful areas, particularly equity investments, would have had to be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the public interest roles expected of AIDC, which remain the raison d'etre for its continued presence in the public sector, it would be preferable if the whole of the required capital could be found from the Budget-option (b). However, the budgetary realities facing the Government inevitably mean that the Government would not have been able to provide the capital required. </PARA>
<PARA> The third option, involving raising capital from the private sector, could have been implemented in a number of ways. Capital could have been raised in the Corporation itself either by issuing voting or non-voting shares. A listed unit trust holding non-voting shares in the Corporation could have also been established. However, these approaches would have either raised insufficient capital or would have altered the essential focus of AIDC's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore has decided to allow AIDC to establish a listed subsidiary company to conduct most of its loan and investment business with up to 30 per cent of the equity to be offered to the public. It is expected that initially up to 20 per cent of equity will be offered for some $50 million. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC remains a statutory corporation 100 per cent owned by the Commonwealth. The Corporation will retain its developmental charter and continue to be subject to general policy guidance from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidiary's objectives will also be directed towards and will cover AIDC's statutory charter. Directors of AIDC will compose the majority of the subsidiary's board. Under the reorganisation the bulk of the business of the Corporation will be transferred to the new wholly owned subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> Assets and liabilities associated with the national interest activities of AIDC will remain with the Corporation. It is intended that AIDC will also remain as the borrower for the group. In return for the transfer of assets and liabilities the subsidiary will issue shares to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidiary will then, at a time determined by market conditions, issue shares to the public and be listed. </PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of the assets and liabilities is to be tax revenue neutral. No tax or stamp duty, State or Commonwealth, is to be paid in respect of the transfer. The subsidiary is also to be placed in the same tax position as the Corporation in respect of the transferred assets and liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be inappropriate for any taxes or charges to be levied in respect of the transfer, given that the activities of the subsidiary will be those previously carried out by AIDC. In any event the cost in terms of taxes and charges normally associated with such a transfer would have been so large as to defeat the whole purpose of the reorganisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the reorganisation and the raising of share capital from the public appropriate ministerial control will be maintained. I will:</PARA>
<PARA> against criteria set out in the Bill, nominate the subsidiary to which the Corporation will transfer its business;</PARA>
<PARA> specify the assets, instruments and liabilities not being transferred, all other assets, instruments and liabilities being transferred to the subsidiary;</PARA>
<PARA> fix the day the reorganisation takes place;</PARA>
<PARA> determine the net value of the transferred business;</PARA>
<PARA> determine the total nominal value of shares issued to the Corporation; and</PARA>
<PARA> have the power to issue directions in relation to the first share issue to the public; the market will determine the price of the shares for any subsequent issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The rights of those staff members transferring from AIDC to the subsidiary have been fully protected under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the listed subsidiary should not be construed as a partial privatisation of AIDC, but rather it is an opportunity for the public to share in the national development objectives of AIDC. No Commonwealth assets will be sold off and the Corporation will remain 100 per cent owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> No single private person or associated group will be permitted to hold more than 10 per cent of the subsidiary's voting equity. This condition and others will ensure the continuing effectiveness of AIDC and the subsidiary in meeting industry policy objectives. These objectives will remain unchanged as will the strict commercial approach to its business that has been a hallmark of the Corporation over past years. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to privatisation measures in Britain, the additional capital raised from the public by the subsidiary will remain with, and contribute directly to, the growth and financial performance of the AIDC Group and not flow to consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> To further assist AIDC the Government has also decided to forgo the 1987/88 dividend which would normally be due to be paid by 31 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the mechanism by which future dividend payments to the Commonwealth will be determined, bringing AIDC into line with other Government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of paying 50 per cent of net profit after tax each year, AIDC will recommend a dividend to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, who may approve the recommendation or direct the Corporation to pay a higher or lower dividend. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the remuneration of AIDC's chief executive will be determined by the board in consultation with the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also now appoint the chief executive of the Corporation on the recommendation of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill increases the capital payable to the Corporation from $150 million to $200 million, of which $100 million has been paid up. The forgone 1987/88 dividend will be counted towards the paid in capital of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The unpaid capital will be available, subject to appropriation, to enable the Corporation to discharge its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is intended to be available only if the Corporation has exhausted all other options in discharging its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains other consequential and minor amendments that will assist both AIDC and the subsidiary in performing their functions. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of the Bill I am introducing today is to amend the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act 1974 to: implement the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration; and include minor additional provisions to facilitate arbitral proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The model law provides a legal framework for the conduct of international arbitrations. It was adopted by the UNCITRAL in 1985 as part of its work in promoting the unification of international trade law. In 1986 the Government established a working group to examine the model law. The working group comprised representatives of the State and Northern Territory Attorneys-General, the Law Council of Australia, the Attorney-General's Department and the Institute of Arbitrators Australia. (Quorum formed). </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend the keeping of a quorum during the second reading because I do not feel up to reading it in the absence of a quorum. The working group recommended adoption of the model law, together with related minor additional amendments to the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act 1974. The working group's recommendations were considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which implements the model law, will not replace the present domestic law on arbitration. It will supplement the existing system by enabling international arbitrations to be conducted in accordance with the model law. The Bill will also allow the States and the Northern Territory to enact identical legislation should they so wish. To date, the model law has been adopted by Canada, Cyprus and California and is under active consideration by the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA>Content of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to some of the more salient features of the Bill. Once again, I remind the Senate that when I say `I' it is actually Senator Bolkus, who, were he able to read, would be reading this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will implement the model law by amending the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act 1974. The Act currently gives effect to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards-the New York Convention-which establishes rules governing the recognition and enforcement, in Australia, of international arbitral awards and agreements. Implementing the model law by amendment to this Act will ensure that all relevant Commonwealth laws relating to international arbitration are comprised in the one instrument. In the event of any conflict being found to exist between the provisions of the model law and the New York Convention, the latter will take precedence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Model Law</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The model law provides an internationally agreed legal framework for the conduct of international arbitrations. It regulates the arbitration agreement, the composition of arbitral tribunals, the conduct of arbitral proceedings, the recognition and enforcement of awards, and recourse against arbitral awards. International recognition of the model law means that its adoption should assist Australia's efforts to establish itself as a centre for international commercial arbitration. In this regard I note that both Melbourne and Sydney have facilities for conducting international arbitrations with the establishment of the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration in Melbourne and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in Sydney. The model law also complements the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which are increasingly being used in the conduct of international ad hoc arbitrations. In a more general context, party autonomy is respected and facilitated by the model law. Parties will no longer be frustrated by unknown provisions of national laws which may conflict with their intentions in respect of their arbitration. While the law in Australia at present is relatively modern it may be unfamiliar to some foreign parties and may be perceived to be undesirable by them. Another aspect of the model law worthy of mention is the delimitation of court assistance and supervision. While the model law recognises the supportive and corrective role to be played by the courts, it will limit judicial intervention and supervision of an arbitration to a greater degree than under present Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now mention-I again remind the Senate that the `I' in this case is not me; it is in fact the Minister for Consumer Affairs, who apparently is not able to read-some of the supplementary matters provided for by the Bill. The first of these is the manner in which the model law is to be implemented. The Bill will implement the model law on an `opt-out' basis. This means it will apply to all international arbitrations unless parties agree, in writing, to exclude its operation. The facilitative provisions of the Bill will however apply on an `opt in' basis. In this regard the Bill will clarify and increase the powers of arbitral tribunals in respect of matters such as the payment of interest on awards, costs and the consolidation of arbitral proceedings. In relation to consolidation, arbitral tribunals will be able, at the request of a party, to consolidate proceedings where, for example, they deal with a common question of fact or law or where the relief claimed arises out of the same transaction. The Bill will thus enable parties to an international arbitration to choose the model law to govern their arbitration, with no additions or amendments, or the model law with all or any of the additional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial and Regulatory Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The International Arbitration Amendment Bill will have no direct impact on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure. A favourable indirect impact on Commonwealth tax revenue may be expected as the provisions may increase the attractiveness of Australia as a centre for international arbitration, though the extent of this is difficult to quantify. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. Again, for the purpose of avoiding any misunderstanding, I explain to the Senate that the `I' referred to there is Senator Bolkus, who would, had he been able to read this speech, have been commending the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill provides for a number of measures aimed at fine-tuning the operations of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC). Before proceeding to outline the specific measures contained in the Bill, I wish to place in context the origins and role of the Commission. When this Government came to office activity at the Federal level in the area of occupational health and safety was virtually nil. This was despite the fact that Australia had an unacceptably high incidence of work-related death and injury which would not be tolerated in other Westernised nations. To give honourable senators an idea of the magnitude of the problem, each year in Australia 550 men and women die as a result of work related accident or disease. In a work force of seven million this incidence rate of 77 per million can be compared with figures produced in the 1984 International Labour Organisation Year Book of Labour Statistics which showed an annual fatality rate per million workers of 22 in Sweden, 24 in the United Kingdom, 20 in Japan and 37 in the United States of America. Conservative estimates show that more than $6 billion a year is wasted in Australia through loss of production and associated costs because of occupational injury and ill-health. The human costs, of course, cannot be quantified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government came to office with a firm commitment, written into the Australian Labor Party platform and reaffirmed in our accord with the trade union movement, to redress this situation. While occupational health and safety regulation was, and still remains, the responsibility of the States, we recognised the need for coordination of effort through an agreed national strategy. In 1984 we set up an interim National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to advise on the appropriate framework for such a strategy. The interim Commission recommended the establishment of a statutory Commission constituted along tripartite lines. The Government accepted this advice and NOHSC was set up in 1985 following the passage of enabling legislation through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary role of the Commission, which has adopted as its working title Worksafe Australia, is to provide a national forum for the development of national standards and strategies in cooperation with the States. The tripartite structure of the 17-member Commission, which includes representatives of the States, of industry and of the trade union movement, provides a consultative framework for development of uniform standards and avoidance of duplication of effort. Through its research arm, the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, the Commission aims to provide research, testing, statistical collection and analysis and training of occupational health and safety professionals. Although NOHSC has existed as a statutory body for less than three years, it has made significant progress towards the development of a national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's achievements include development of a uniform national data set of comparable statistics on the incidence and nature of occupational health and safety problems. This has been a massive task involving all State and Territory Governments in the collection of uniform data, with minimum disruption to existing systems and without adding to the reporting burden on employers. The Commission is also in the process of developing national standards and codes of practice, which detail preventive action required to avert deaths, injuries and diseases on a range of issues. It has already declared codes of practice for occupational overuse syndrome-previously known as repetitive strain injury-and for asbestos. At its September meeting the Commission is expected to declare a code of practice on timber preservatives. Also, work is continuing on agreed standards, codes and guidance notes for safe manual handling, lead, noise and mechanical equipment safety. I emphasise that these standards and codes are advisory in nature-a point which has been misconstrued in some quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of NOHSC reflects the Government's belief that improvements in occupational health and safety standards in Australia can be best progressed by cooperation, not coercion. By providing a national forum for the development of cooperative arrangements between the States, the Government aimed at laying the groundwork for the progressive shedding by the States of their complex, and often conflicting, web of regulations. By issuing advisory codes the Commission aims to reduce rather than increase the degree of regulation concerning occupational health and safety in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes a number of amendments and consequent changes to the composition of the Commission and its executive to incorporate the Chief Executive Officer as a member. It also makes provision for the duties of director of the Institute to be performed by the Chief Executive Officer, or for the positions to be separately filled. This will allow maximum flexibility in appointing available and suitably qualified personnel in a field where expertise is scarce and where we must compete for such expertise in an international market. These amendments to the Act will facilitate and consolidate the significant improvements in the national Commission's operation and reflects in a practical way the Government's continuing commitment to improving the safety and quality of working life in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate relates to the package of Bills by which the Government proposes to create an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government for the first time. The Bills are the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill 1988, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988 and the A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1988. In addition, cognately we are debating three Bills that have been introduced by the Australian Democrats. The Liberal Party will not be supporting the Democrats' Bills, and I shall refer briefly to our reasons for that. In some respects we have considerable sympathy with what the Democrats' Bills seek to do. In part, they seek to set up freedom of information, administrative review and an ombudsman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is ironic, really, that the Democrats should be attempting to do all these things at this stage of the development of a package of government for the ACT. In a sense, they are persisting in attempting to do exactly what many people in the ACT are complaining about, that is, to impose Federal Government views on the people of Canberra. I do not have the slightest doubt that these matters will be brought into existence, but that will be done by the ACT Government which we are establishing, and that is the right and proper way for them to come about. I think we should ensure that our intervention in this is the minimum required. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that the Democrats have raised relates to the protection of the national interest. It is our view that the national interest is protected by the legislation that has been brought in, and planning power is retained by the Commonwealth for those matters to which that ought to apply. Planning in other respects will go to the ACT Government, although I am critical of some aspects of the way that this matter has been handled, and I will refer further to this later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this matter, many representations have come from the community, and they have been referred to. In fact, most of the matters to which I wanted to draw the attention of the Senate have already been raised here. Therefore, I will restrict my remarks, as against what I might have said had I been the first or only speaker on the topic. I will deal with some specific matters rather than canvass the whole story, because there is certainly a great deal for the Senate to do on this matter, and others, before any of us will have the opportunity to spend Christmas this year with our families and not our parliamentary colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats also have before the Senate a constitutional Bill. I think this matter also may well develop as time passes, and I think the ACT Government may well ask for such a measure to be brought about. However, I again put this in the category of imposing more upon the people of Canberra than is necessary at this stage. This again comes into the category of doing the very things that we are saying ought not to be done and ought not to be dealt with by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This most recent proposal to grant self-government has been under discussion only since 19 October, when the legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives. It was then brought to this chamber on 7 November. However, to merely look at those historical dates does not really give an indication of the history of this matter and what in fact has gone on. I intended to refer at some length to comments made recently about our delaying the legislation but, in view of Senator McMullan's comments yesterday, I do not feel that it is necessary to say more than that we have kept to the Government's timetable. No delay has been caused by the Opposition which would impede this matter proceeding to an election in March of next year, or whenever the Government wishes to hold it. As I said, I think most people have been fairly conscientious and diligent about looking at the legislation and giving thorough consideration to the amendments which are brought forward. As Senator Jenkins has said, and is quoted on the front page of today's Canberra Times as saying, the Australian Democrats have `buckets' of amendments. To have not looked at them in great detail and with thoroughness would not have been giving the matter the attention that it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to support this legislation, which will finally bring to the people of the ACT a real say in the development of this Territory, a real say in the decisions which affect their lives, through elected representatives who will be responsible for the decisions that are made in this Territory and who will be answerable at the ballot box for the decisions that are made covering all matters: housing, health, education, industry and development, welfare and so on-matters which in other places are dealt with by State and local governments, but in which we have not had a say in the past and on which we have not had people making the decisions who were answerable to this electorate. It is somewhat ironic in a sense that right at the heart of the national capital that has been the case for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be wrong to leave the impression, though, that everybody in the ACT is unanimous in their support for what is happening. Some years ago it was very clearly the case that most Canberrans were against any form of local government. Not only a Canberra Times survey just last weekend, but also correspondence I have been receiving from constituents in recent years indicates that people have come to an awareness of the need to have a responsible government here dealing with these issues. Frequently in letters people write about one thing or another but they indicate in their comments that it is wrong that we do not have a say. What that really means is that they want a system of government whereby they will be able to have a say, and that has been a significant change. I think just about every commercial organisation and other organisations in Canberra have written and expressed views or presented submissions in one way or another over the last few years indicating their support for a form of self-government for the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the debate is not new. It has been going on for a long time. The first attempt to form an administration was in 1928, when three members of the Federal Capital Development Commission were elected on a property franchise. That Commission, of course, had no administrative or executive powers and existed for only a couple of years. In 1930 an advisory council of four appointed and three elected members was established. That lasted until 1974, with variations in the numbers of those who were elected and appointed. But throughout the years there has been debate on the question of what has loosely been referred to as `self-government' for the ACT. The debate has been within the community and within the Federal Parliament and the governments that have had the responsibility for running the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1934 the Scullin Government expressed the view that `within a few years'-it cannot have imagined how long it would be, I am sure-`we shall be able to give full civic control of the city to the people themselves'. The Chifley Government in 1949 requested the Hobart Town Clerk to examine possible models of self-government which might be appropriate to Canberra. In 1955 a Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra recommended a legislative council with State-type functions but no administrative powers, with a multiplicity of local government arrangements as well. Nineteen fifty-seven saw the recommendation by the Institute of Public Administration of a national capital council as a form of statutory authority, and the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) was established at about that time. </PARA>
<PARA> All the while the advisory council that had been established was pressing for devolution of real power to a local self-governing body. Mr Anthony, as Minister for the Interior in 1967, proposed that Commonwealth control of Canberra, with a handover of State-type functions and new municipal governments, be formed in Woden and Belconnen. His successor, Mr Hunt, in 1971 suggested that 1980 would be an appropriate target date for the achievement of self-government. Perhaps he was as near to predicting the date as one could get. The Australian Labor Party had a hand in the self-government proposal in the period 1972-1975. The Whitlam Government asserted that self-government would be achieved as soon as practicable after the presentation of the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. That Committee, which was set up in, I think, 1972, in fact had not reported by the time there was a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has always recognised the role of self-government and the right of people to have a say in their government. I will not read the extracts from Liberal Party policy that I took out because I do not believe it is necessary to do so at this time. In 1976 a task force was established which later reported on a program of transfer of functions and the necessary legislative and administrative arrangements needed for self-government. A gradual devolution of powers was proposed. However, that was rejected in a referendum in 1978, for reasons which I think are fairly well known to everybody at this time. Three questions were put to the people in that referendum, and there was criticism of them, so the advisory body continued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, which was a purely advisory body, continued to function until it was abolished by the present Government in 1986. Although it was strictly speaking a purely advisory body, I think it would be wrong at this stage not at least to acknowledge the significant electorate and constituent work done by members of the House of Assembly. Perhaps the honourable member for Fraser, John Langmore, and I know better than anyone else exactly how much work was done in the community by the members of the House of Assembly. We have been able to judge that by the vast increase in our work since the Assembly was abolished in 1986. Perhaps the Assembly ought not to have been abolished then but should have stayed in existence until another form of government was established. Perhaps, though, the Assembly's abolition at that time helped to heighten the awareness of those involved in the community of the need for self-government. I guess it is not possible to make a conclusion as to exactly what should have happened at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal reason for the time taken in the resolution of this matter and for the failure to establish self-government in 1986 has been the difficulty in finding an acceptable electoral system. There has, of course, always been debate about the extent of powers and the way in which powers should be transferred, and that is understandable. However, it is the electoral system which has been at the centre of debate in recent times. The Bills we are now debating propose to grant to the Australian Capital Territory responsibility for virtually all of those areas which would in other jurisdictions fall to the States or local government, except initially in regard to the police, courts and legal administration, about which we are moving amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the debate on the electoral system has been important and necessary. While many other aspects of self-government which we are seeking to establish can perhaps be changed more easily, it is less likely that the electoral system will be able to be changed in the future. Therefore, it is important to get it as correct as any electoral system can be. There is no doubt that there is not a perfect electoral system. I had prepared notes on the various systems which had been proposed and was going to talk about each of those in detail. However, I do not think that is now necessary. We have had proposals for a one-electorate system, a two-electorate system, single member electorates, tiered systems with some members elected at large and some in single member electorates, and combinations of just about anything else one can think of. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal the Government came up with this year was the d'Hondt system, a system that is widely used in Europe. In our opinion that system was not suitable to this electorate. I do not believe that the system we have now decided on is, in fact, the d'Hondt system but a significantly varied one which I think really should not have that name; it is an Australian Capital Territory electoral system suitable, in my opinion, to a city State. It does not have within it every aspect of an electoral system that I would regard as essential but, again, as I said, there is no such thing as a perfect electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I want to say in regard to the electoral system is that there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the negotiations have been genuine and sincere. The Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties have paid great attention to working out a system suitable to the type of community that Canberra is-a community loosely described by me and others as a city State. The other thing to take into account in determining the type of electoral system the Australian Capital Territory will have is that it will have a one-chamber legislature: there will not be a House of review. So some of the aspects of an electoral system with a House of review needed to be included in the unicameral system. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I referred to the National Capital Development Commission and planning. I have been unhappy with the way in which the Government has handled the abolition of the Commission. I recognise that the planning arrangements have to change once self-government comes into effect. However, my particular concerns about the way it has been handled relate to the staff of the Commission. The Commission has served Canberra well for the 30 years that it has been in existence and I believe that the success of this city and the way it is planned flow from the diligence with which it has proceeded with the work it has been given. I recognise that not everybody in Canberra agreed with all its decisions. There was no possibility of that ever being the case. Planning for the national areas will remain with an authority answerable to this Parliament and planning for Canberra will be with the ACT Government. As I have said, it is the way the staff have been treated that has upset me most of all. I have had a number of letters and representations. I quote briefly from one letter which referred to how staff were dealt with and to retrenchment:</PARA>
<PARA>The basis of selection of such staff-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, those who would be retrenched and those who would remain-</PARA>
<PARA>has not been adequately explained, but it is certainly the case that no opportunity to nominate for such an offer-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, retrenchment-</PARA>
<PARA>was ever given to staff in general. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I seek your help in obtaining objective, equitable consideration to extending additional offers to the small number of staff who would prefer to have this option made available to them. A forced transfer to ACT Administration because a current function continues there, or resignation if dissatisfied is no choice at all. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is here, will take notice of this plea from some members of the staff of the NCDC and ask that the matter be looked at again with a view to dealing more equitably with the people whose jobs are being disrupted as a result of the changes taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time the people of Canberra have been apprehensive, quite understandably, as to the financial arrangements which would exist. The cry that self-government would cost more is something that many of us have heard over many years. I think that that was principally because people in Canberra did not have much idea what it really cost to run the place and where the money came from. People in the rest of Australia thought that we were heavily subsidised. The accounting arrangements have been so structured that it will now be possible to know what is raised here and what is spent here. The books have been put in order in that respect, with the assistance of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in recent reports on the Australian Capital Territory. Adjustments may have to be made, but it will be the responsibility of the ACT Government to determine what moneys will be raised and how they will be spent. Those people who do the raising and spending will find themselves answerable at the ballot box on the next occasion that people have the opportunity to express a view. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, we can now see the financial arrangement that will exist in the Territory, which arrangement is significantly different. The Commonwealth has made some commitment for the next few years and there will be a government to negotiate as to what is fair and reasonable for the Territory for the future. It will now be up to the ACT Government to make representations to the Grants Commission. It will not be a bureaucratic function, which it has obviously had to be in the past. There are transitional arrangements which will have to come into effect. There has been talk of some Federal assistance with the establishment of the Assembly and its support services. The ACT should be treated similarly to the Northern Territory in that regard. The Northern Territory had an existing body when self-government was transferred to it. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues in Canberra in recent times have highlighted for many people the reason why they want accountable members in this electorate. The closure of schools, the provision of health services and the debate over the development of section 19 in Civic suffice to indicate some of the things that have caused people to come to a view that it is necessary to have more say. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor has been the Government's precipitate and quite wrong abolition of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ACT after the last election. I have spoken about that in this place on several occasions previously and I shall not go into the history of it again. But there is no doubt that that was a decision that ought not to have been made. The system for the variation of the city plan of Canberra which was put in its place has not been satisfactory in my opinion. That is no criticism of the staff who service that committee or the members who are on it. I think it has not been possible for it to function in the way that the Joint Committee on the ACT functioned from the time of its inception to the time of its demise at the election in 1987 when the Government failed to reinstate it. I think there still needs to be some arrangement whereby there can be structured communication between the ACT Government and the Federal Government on matters of interest between the two groups for the development of the capital because the national capital areas are still of great interest to those of us who live here. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the ACT Government success, as others have done. I shall certainly be taking a great interest in it. I am pleased to support the Bills that are before the Parliament and hope that we can get the matter concluded as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is obviously an important occasion in the history of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I am glad that we have finally got to this point. It seems that this debate and the lead-up to it have been going on forever. But one would have to say that in the course of the last few weeks goodwill has been shown by the Opposition. I thank Senator Hill for his acknowledgment of the contribution of the various people and organisations who have been involved in the process. I also put on record my gratitude to Senator Hill for his constructive approach to the resolution of many of the issues raised in the development of this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins expressed some concern as to how this legislation was developed. She said that there was little, if any, local input. If one reads between the lines of what Senator Jenkins had to say I guess that there is an inference that it is all some sort of bureaucratic plot. The Government has been concerned at all times to have openness in the development of these proposals. We distributed a comprehensive discussion paper which was widely circulated in the ACT. It must have been widely circulated in the ACT because it generated a great deal of public comment. Those comments from individuals and groups were important in the development of the final package. I would also like to take the opportunity to remind Senator Jenkins that the Government has been striving for a long time to ensure some sort of tripartite support for these proposals. We have exposed our thinking on all the issues and all the ideas at every stage of the process in an attempt to collectively develop a package which could bring democracy to Canberra. In doing so, I think everyone would concede that the Government has made concession after concession in an attempt to make sure that we got a consensus. The Opposition has contributed, I believe, in a positive and cooperative way. The Australian Democrats are still talking of the need for more concessions, particularly in electoral matters. I find it a bit difficult to understand how we can give more. I hope that Senator Jenkins can carefully consider her position on that.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the time is right now for the ACT to accept the responsibility of self-government. The cost to the Commonwealth of achieving democracy for 270,000 citizens in Canberra is minimal; it entails a short term guarantee only-preserving the existing financial arrangements for two years; not an increase in financial support, just a preservation. The only other cost would be an establishment grant which, of course, occurred in the case of the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island and, indeed, Papua New Guinea when it was on the road to self-government. The time is also right from the point of view of directing Canberra's future. The development of the national capital, in the Commonwealth's view, is virtually finished. The public sector can no longer be the only means of maintaining any impetus for development in the ACT. Its future must come from the private sector, from ordinary citizens. If that is to happen, then obviously self-government is the only way which will ensure that the citizens of Canberra have a say in managing that fundamental change. All the necessary reforms to prepare for self-government are already in place. The administrative matters, apart from some law and order functions, are handled in one organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill did say during the debate that he considers 17,000 for the public service in the ACT to be a very high figure. He has said that there must be more accountability. The Government would agree that the community should have more control over its own government; that is obviously the essence of the whole proposal. The fact is, however, that the ACT's public service, by comparison with other States and Territories, is far from fat. On a per capita basis, the ACT has fewer public servants engaged upon State and municipal matters than any State or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial arrangements will treat the ACT on the same basis as the States-they will recognise the special circumstances arising from Canberra's role as the national capital. Importantly, as Senator Hill pointed out, the ACT's own government, rather than the Federal Government, will represent the ACT community in negotiations for Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. Under the new financial arrangements here, the ACT will pay for its own planning and development. Members of the community must have a say in how their money is spent. This concern is addressed in new planning and development arrangements detailed in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill. The Territory will be responsible for normal metropolitan planning, development and land management matters. The Commonwealth's interest as the custodian of the national capital for all Australians will be protected through the development of a national capital plan. The ACT will not be able to do anything that is inconsistent with that plan. In addition, the Commonwealth will continue to own the land, while the ACT will manage it on the Commonwealth's behalf using the existing leasehold system. </PARA>
<PARA> This new process means that there will be a clear and unambiguous division between national and local responsibilities. Each level of government will be fully accountable for its defined responsibilities. As Senator Hill pointed out earlier, debate on the proposed electoral system has been exhaustive. I think I am one who could bear witness to the exhaustion of the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has exhausted many people. The d'Hondt system is the end product of those exhaustive negotiations. The first point I would like to make about the d'Hondt system is to acknowledge that it is a compromise. It was not the Government's first choice; it was not even the Government's second choice. The Government believed that the best system was one which is used to elect people's Houses throughout the Commonwealth and that is, of course, the single member constituency system. The Opposition and the Democrats would not support that proposition. The Government believed that the next best system was an amalgam of the single member constituency system and the Senate system whereby half of the members would be elected under the single member constituency system and half would be elected under the Senate system. This proposal was also rejected. Hence, in searching for common ground, the d'Hondt system was selected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While acknowledging that this system was not either the first or second choice of the Government, it is a sound electoral system which is used in countries throughout the world. It is a people's House system and its reputation in Western democracies is high. The positive process of negotiation between the Government and the Opposition on this question means that the system as now proposed-once again I thank Senator Hill in acknowledging his contribution in suggesting modifications to the original proposal-is appropriate to the unique needs of the city State of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins raised with me this morning a number of questions in regard to the system. I can best summarise the position by saying that she has given me a number of scenarios which would circumvent, if you like, the d'Hondt system and render it difficult for Canberra democracy. Over the last half an hour I have had departmental officers looking at the points she raised. I am not in a position to give an exhaustive and exact answer to each of her questions. All I can say in light of the very brief time that I have had to look at them is that the possibility of the scenarios raised ever occurring is so remote as to enable us to disregard them out of hand. I would think that the prospect of 20 parties all gaining around 5 per cent of the vote would rate in the area of a million to one and perhaps a billion to one. I have not calculated the odds, but I do not think I will bother. Having sat down in my office for a few minutes to look at what Senator Jenkins put to me, I do not think we ought to modify the system to account for that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot claim to have been a student of every election in the Commonwealth of Australia in the last 100 years, but I have taken a pretty keen interest in elections over the years. I cannot recall any election, even at local government level, where such a result even came close. Obviously, one would expect occasionally to see such a result in local government elections, but it just never occurs. So I am not going to get overly worried about the fact that the legislation does not take into account that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the type of government proposed for the ACT is a careful balance between giving the ACT appropriate legislative and executive control over its own affairs, adjusting to make sure that the ACT is treated equitably in money terms compared with the rest of Australia, unequivocally preserving the Commonwealth's interest in the national capital and, at the same time, ensuring a genuine political separation that insulates Commonwealth politics from those at a territorial level. I am confident that further discussion at the committee stage on particular issues, as foreshadowed by both Senator Hill and Senator Jenkins, will be positive. With continued goodwill and unanimity of purpose on all sides, the people of the ACT will at last be able to decide their own affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to reply briefly to remarks that have been made on the three Bills put forward by the Australian Democrats. Needless to say, we are very disappointed that neither the Government nor the Opposition appears to be willing to support any of these Bills. It has been said by speakers for the Government and the Opposition that they have some sympathy with the Bills, that they are principled and that the principles are correct, but there is no need for them or there is no need for them at this time. We in the Australian Democrats dispute that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill to provide open government, probity and citizens' rights is based on the proposition that open government, probity and citizens' rights in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are of fundamental concern to residents of the Territory and are matters that should be assured to those residents during the present time of constitutional development of the Territory and that it is fully appropriate for such assurances to be given by the Federal Parliament at this time. The Bill brings together in a convenient and readily acceptable form the key elements of concern to citizens generally. As far as open government is concerned, we in this Federal Parliament can assure the people of the ACT that they can have freedom of information, the review of administrative decisions and access to an ombudsman. We can also ensure that they can have such standard practices as open meetings and publication of minutes of meetings, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as probity in government is concerned, our proposal recognises the advantage to the legislature, to the Assembly itself, of being able to readily call upon a body with appropriate expertise, so that the ACT Assembly would have that right given to it by the Federal Parliament. Conflicts of interest are dealt with in this Bill. Also we see civil rights as including protection against the acquisition of property on other than just terms and as being something that this Federal Parliament should ensure that the people of the ACT have. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the second Bill, relating to the protection of the national interest, we agree, and it appears that Senator Reid agrees with us, that the people of the ACT should have the maximum degree of autonomy consistent with the national interest. We feel that the Federal Parliament itself may need, through a short-life ordinance, to ask the ACT Assembly to pause in its review of a certain situation, but this should be done openly by the Federal Parliament-by the legislature itself-and not by any executive arm of government. We believe that we should be able to pass on that right to the people of the ACT through their Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> The final Bill, relating to the establishment and amendment of the new Constitution, is based on the proposition that the citizens of the ACT should have a mechanism available to them by which the ACT Constitution can be repatriated, after which it would be amended by local decision. So we are not taking that right away from the people. We are guaranteeing them the right to have their own Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, it is disappointing to the Australian Democrats that it appears that these Bills will not have the support of either the Government or the Opposition. I presume we will be shortly moving the second reading amendment, the Robson amendment, and I would hope again that the Government and the Opposition would look very carefully at this one. It is a system which works very well in Tasmania. It is essentially fair. If we had had it for the Senate the Robert Wood syndrome, which seems to be a syndrome that worries the Government and the Opposition a great deal, would have been dealt with. Robert Wood would not have been elected had this system been working, which involves the rotation of candidates in such a way that people are voted for, certainly not Party lists. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson referred briefly to a matter that I flagged to him earlier this morning. I ask that he seriously consider the four points I raised there. He referred briefly to one of them. I think those are matters that we should consider very carefully and I hope that will be done in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to Government amendment (15). It contains important subject matter. Part of the self-government debate has revolved around the appropriate functions to be transferred from the Commonwealth to the new self-governing Assembly. No doubt the Committee will be aware that in the Government's original Bill there were a number of controversial areas which were not to be transferred. I refer, for example, to clause 22 (1) (b) where the establishment of courts was not to be transferred; in respect of paragraph (c) the provision by the Australian Federal Police of police services in relation to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was not to be transferred; and in regard to paragraph (f) the admission of persons to practise as legal practitioners for regulating the practice of persons so admitted was not to be transferred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of negotiations the Government has put this amendment before the Committee which will have the effect of transferring paragraphs (1) (c) and (1) (f). In other words, the Government has been prepared to effect a transfer before 1 July 1990 of police functions and of matters relating to legal practitioners and regulating their practice. We support that. In relation to the Australian Federal Police, in case there is any confusion, in advocating that we are not suggesting that the Assembly should rush out and set up its own police force. In fact, if it sought to do so this Parliament might take some action. What is being proposed and what is dealt with to some extent in consequential amendments is an agency agreement between the Territory and the Australian Federal Police to provide services for the Territory. That seems to us to be a sensible solution. No doubt it will require some negotiation, but not only does it seem sensible to us in the form of police matters, but we suspect that it is also sensible in terms of cost efficiency. Therefore, on that basis we have argued for, and now obviously support, the Government's intention to move across both those functions. </PARA>
<PARA> That leaves one controversial area which the Government by its amendment is not seeking to transfer, and that is the establishment of courts. We have had discussions with the Australian Democrats on this matter. We find it difficult to come across a valid argument that would prohibit transfer of the courts as at a specified date in the future. We are not arguing-at least, we have not argued for some time-that they should be transferred immediately, as we concede that there might be difficulties in relation to tenure of the judges and other administrative matters. As I said during the second reading debate, we have attempted to take a cautious approach to the whole process of self-government. Therefore, although we may have suggested it earlier, in recent times we have not insisted that the courts be transferred as at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Having had the opportunity to peruse at least one memorandum of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, and recognising also that the Law Society has now said to us that it does not want to see a specified date for the transfer of the courts, in my opinion a valid argument has still not been put before me as to why the function of the courts should not be transferred at some future specified date. It does seem strange to have a situation where, basically, all functions relating to self-government except the courts are transferred. I hope that the Government will try to give a reason for excluding the courts from this provision. I invite the Government to explain to the Committee why it is not prepared to go the way that we have been advocating and why it specifically wishes that the establishment of courts, and therefore the functioning of courts, in the ACT remain in Commonwealth hands and not in the hands of the territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall endeavour to give the reasons for the Government's position on the transfer of the courts and the proposal to look at this matter again in 1990 and make a decision then. The reason for that is that there are issues to be resolved in the interim. I shall take a few moments to go through some of the issues. The first concerns the consequences of having a combination of judicial functions in the hands, quite possibly, of only one person-the Chief Minister in the new Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government. Under the self-government Bill the Chief Minister will have all of the executive powers virtually in his or her own hands. The other Ministers will have only the responsibilities allocated to them by the Chief Minister. There is to be no administrator of the Australian Capital Territory. The appointment of judges and magistrates, therefore, would have to be made by the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister, or perhaps another Minister if the Chief Minister decided to allocate the function, would also be responsible for prosecutions and for legal aid. That adds up to the possibility of a great many functions being concentrated in the one person. The Government is concerned at the consequences of that sort of a consolidation of power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also the question of the security of tenure of judges and magistrates. The Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act makes provisions for the removal of judges. They are the same provisions that apply in the Constitution for the removal of Federal judges, which is by the Governor-General on an address from both Houses of Parliament. The Magistrates Court Ordinance provides:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Magistrate may be suspended from office by the Governor-General on the grounds of misbehaviour or incapacity, but that removal of a Magistrate from office requires the same procedure as applies to the removal of a Judge. </PARA>
<PARA>Those provisions may not be appropriate on transfer of responsibility to the ACT, because the Governor-General, acting on the advice of Commonwealth Ministers, would have to become involved in a Territory issue which might arise entirely out of local Territory political conditions. Provisions should be in place to provide a guarantee of security of tenure for judges and magistrates. This is a matter which perhaps could be resolved in the course of the next 18 months prior to the Government's reviewing the position. I think the existing magistrates would have some reason to be concerned about their security of tenure if provisions were not put in place, and one would imagine that the resident judges of the Supreme Court of the ACT would also have some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, they would have the option of resigning their Territory commissions and retaining Federal Court commissions. I am not sure how one would work out that handover. When the Northern Territory assumed responsibility for its Supreme Court, the Northern Territory Supreme Court as established by the Commonwealth Act was abolished. A Supreme Court created by a new law in the Northern Territory took its place and arrangements were made between the judges of the former court and the Territory Government they they would accept commissions to the Territory court. This ensured continuity. The handing over of the Magistrates Court in the Northern Territory was not complicated by the existence of equivalent removal provisions. The Cabinet decision to review this position in the middle of 1990 would give us a reasonable period in the interim to try to sort out the problems which I have just outlined. The Government believes those problems to be of such import as to be worthy of further consideration prior to the handover. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.46)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I readily concede-I thought I did so when I spoke a few moments ago-that the provision for a period of time to allow negotiation and settlement of these matters is a sensible course of action. To that extent the Government has persuaded me. However, when I consider the reasons that have again been stated by the Minister as to why the Government is not prepared to agree to the transfer of the functions of the courts as at a specified forward date, they do not seem to stand up. They seem to be arguments not against transferring the function but against transferring the function at this time. I have to say that the argument about the separation of powers is invalid. State governments appoint judges. I do not think that a case has been made out that the fact that in this instance the Chief Minister will do it will in any way distinguish the ACT system from what is already in existence in all of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, questions of security of tenure need to be resolved over a period. Had the Government included paragraph (b) in this instance it would have been stipulating that by 1 July 1990 it would resolve the question of security of tenure. Even this Government, I would have thought, could resolve such a simple question within that time frame. The third reason the Minister gave was concern about joint commissions. Again, joint commissions are not at all complex to organise. I would have thought that the commonsense approach to the judges in relation to joint commissions would simply be that they be given a commission by the Territory for Territory matters and a commission by the Commonwealth for Commonwealth matters. </PARA>

The Commonwealth can provide services to the ACT on an agency basis. Senator Hill was discussing this a moment ago in relation to one of the Government amendments.

Government is an expensive business these days-I hope that in dealing with the Remuneration Tribunal in the next 24 hours, we do not think it is too expensive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was also our view. We saw the existing clause 8 as, in fact, a compromise. For the number of members of the legislature to be increased would require regulation. Therefore, there would be a Commonwealth input. However, as is stated in the clause:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (15) Page 5, after clause 14, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Conflict of Interest</PARA>
<PARA> ``14a. (1) A member of the Assembly who is a party to, or has a direct or indirect interest in, a contract made by or on behalf of the Territory or a Territory authority shall not take part in a discussion of a matter, or vote on a question, in a meeting of the Assembly where the matter or question relates directly or indirectly to that contract. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) A question concerning the application of subsection (1) shall be decided by the Assembly, and a contravention of that subsection does not invalidate anything done by the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the importance of dealing with conflict of interest separately in this legislation. Subclauses (2) and (3) of clause 14, as the Bill currently stands, deal with conflict of interest. The Democrats would seek to amend those by having a conflict of interest provision under a separate heading-a new clause 14a headed `Conflict of Interest' with subclauses (1) and (2). We believe that those clauses are so important to probity in government operations that they should be separated out in their own right, irrespective of whether they are to be retained in this Bill or transferred at a later date to another appropriate Bill. The Democrats most definitely would like to see conflict of interest clauses separated out, standing there for all to see. </PARA>

<PARA> (16) Page 6, clause 15, lines 1 to 39 leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to have the whole of clause 15, as it stands, deleted from the Bill. Clauses 5 to 9 of my first Bill would have dealt with this matter in a much better way. The Bill to which I am referring is the Australian Capital Territory (Protection of the National Interest) Bill 1988, which is no longer on the agenda. However, clauses 5 to 9 of that Bill deal with this matter so much better than it is dealt with under clause 15 of the Government's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a major national issue, not just a territorial matter. The ongoing relationship between the national authorities and the territorial authorities should be spelt out absolutely clearly. The principle to be observed, as far as possible, is that there should not be intervention in the legislature of one level of government-that is, the Australian Capital Territory Assembly-by the Executive of another level of government. I believe that an after the event tabling of a statement of reasons is not adequate protection. I ask the Government and the Opposition to look very carefully at this matter. I would be very pleased if a deferment were sought on this particular clause so that the Government and the Opposition may examine clauses 5 to 9 of the protection of the national interest Bill to see whether they would be preferable to what is in the Bill before us as it stands. </PARA>

Therefore, given that there is no Administrator there has to be a last resort power. Clearly, it is not going to be exercised every day of the week. It would be a game parliament-it would not be a government; it would be a parliament-that took that decision. As honourable senators know, when Governors-General take decisions to sack governments we tend to get a bit of a reaction. I do not think that that would be any different in this circumstance.

When we are looking at provisions that will take precedence over local law and local enactments, it is important that we be cautious in ensuring that we do not go beyond what is absolutely proper in all the circumstances. Our proposed amendment is a little more modest; nevertheless, in my opinion, it adequately addresses the important subject matter of protecting the management and operation of this place from inadvertent local enactments that might detrimentally affect our functions. I will oppose the Australian Democrats' amendment, much of which is included within and taken up in the amendment which I intend to move in due course.

The area was acquired by the Commonwealth from New South Wales originally, for the purpose of guaranteeing water to the ACT. The Commonwealth has obligations under the Act to the New South Wales Government. The land in question obviously is owned by the Commonwealth, just as is the land in the ACT. So for the reason that it has obligations to New South Wales, it cannot abdicate its role in respect of the dam.

The price watch organisation surveys grocery prices monthly at the stores of four different food chains on the Gold Coast. The prices of 36 grocery items are surveyed and the items are typical of those which a low to middle income family would buy. Using the statistical data supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the 36 items are weighted to reflect the relative usage of the particular groceries. For example, most families would buy a carton of milk more often than a jar of coffee. Milk thus has a higher weighting than coffee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey is carried out by trained volunteers. Before any calculations are made, their returns are checked by an experienced person in a price watch organisation. About three or four days after the survey takes place, the total weighted basket prices for the various stores are given to local newspapers and other media outlets on the Coast. This allows Gold Coast residents to compare the pricing structure of various stores. It also allows individual stores to see how they rate in comparison with their competitors. There are significant variations in prices from store to store. In the October survey the basket cost ranged from $64.53 to $71.53. Earlier this month the prices for the 36-item basket of goods ranged from $66.66 to $70.36. </PARA>
<PARA> In the surveys, stores in the Coles chain have not on the whole fared well in relation to their competitors. This obviously struck a raw nerve in the Coles organisation because this week Coles placed the same double-paged advertisement in the Gold Coast press and in a metropolitan daily newspaper-the Gold Coast Bulletin and the Brisbane Sun. The aim of the advertisement was to portray Coles as quite competitive. Unfortunately, certain aspects of this advertisement were quite misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter I wish to raise is that this advertisement, without any evidence, claims that price watch groups distort the facts. If Coles has any evidence to back up this claim, the organisation should produce that evidence. If it does not have any evidence, and I believe it does not have a scintilla of evidence, the organisation should not wrongly try to denigrate community organisations. The price watch organisation on the Gold Coast is competently run and it provides a worthwhile community service. If Coles, or any other store, is dissatisfied that its prices do not compare favourably with those of other stores, it should first look at its prices rather than try to besmirch the organisation which, using voluntary labour, is able to provide the public with price comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to mention is that in its advertisement Coles has compared two stores: Coles New World at Labrador and Woolworths at Broadbeach, both suburbs of the Gold Coast. There is nothing wrong with comparing these two stores, although they are many kilometres apart. A better comparison for Woolworths, Broadbeach, would be the nearby Coles Pacific Fair. But that would not suit Coles whose Pacific Fair store has higher prices than its nearby competitors. In fact, the November survey showed that Coles Pacific Fair was more expensive than Woolworths, Broadbeach. </PARA>
<PARA> But as I said, there is nothing wrong with comparing the two stores that were in the Coles advertisement. What is wrong is that Coles has deliberately implied that because one of its stores was less expensive than one Woolworths store, all Coles stores are cheaper than all Woolworths stores. The evidence is clear that this is not so. Indeed, the evidence in the Gold Coast region is that on the whole Coles stores are among the most expensive. All five Coles stores which were surveyed in October were more expensive than the average price of the 13 stores surveyed. Four of those five were more expensive than any of the other stores. For the November survey, two Coles stores were below the average price for 15 stores surveyed. Three were above average and it was a Coles store which was the most expensive. The evidence clearly shows that the comparison of one Coles store with one Woolworths store is not sufficient to reach the conclusion that all stores from one chain are less expensive than all stores from another chain. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter worthy of mention is the actual list used by Coles in its advertisement. Unlike the price watch basket of goods, the Coles list does not at first glance appear to be typical of what a low to middle income family would buy. Over $10, for example, was spent on coffee, another $2.65 for tea and $6.08 on three different types of cereal. And unlike price watch, the prices are not weighted according to their relative usage. I am not saying that the group which carried out the research for Coles deliberately chose articles to give the Coles store an advantage, but that could easily be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I mention the following points. Firstly, the price watch organisation on the Gold Coast is a competent body. If stores do not like the results of the price watch surveys they should first look at their pricing policies. To denigrate a voluntary organisation carrying out a community service does not reflect well on an organisation such as Coles. Secondly, the assertion by Coles that New World is a competitive place to shop is not borne out by the evidence. Some of its stores in the Gold Coast region are far from competitive. Thirdly, the price watch survey will continue and will, from time to time, change its basket of goods so that any store which happens to obtain a list of the price watch basket's contents cannot artificially lower its surveyed prices by concentrating its efforts on only the goods in the basket. The results of each survey will be made public. Fourthly and finally, if Coles is concerned that some of its stores are more expensive than those in other chains, the remedy is in its hands-it should reduce its prices. If Coles is not competitive, the price watch organisation will not shirk its community responsibility to let the public know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measures contained in the two defence legislation amendment Bills before us-the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 and the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988-are welcomed by the Opposition. They have been a long time coming. While the proposed amendments are a step in the right direction, they do tend to highlight the urgent need for attention to more substantial matters. The bulk of Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No. 2, for example, is made up of odds and ends of housekeeping which were not perfected the first time and which have been left until now to be tidied up. I will deal with these first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Proposals such as the decriminalisation of the wearing of articles of service uniform, the exemption of Small Arms Factory employees from firearms licensing laws and the removal of the upper limit on the amount of reparations that may be ordered by a court martial or Defence Force magistrate are quite simply good housekeeping. Each one simply rectifies what has become a Dickensian situation. Likewise, provisions to place the position of the Vice Chief of the Defence Force on a statutory basis and to include instructors in the Australian Cadet Corps are matters with which we are in accord. As for the amendment establishing arrangements for salvage claims made by naval crews, this too is really just an overdue formal recognition and regulation for the Navy of what has been maritime practice for centuries-that is, the right of salvors to claim salvage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the amendment to the Defence Act 1903 which requires a senior officer to render 12 months service following promotion before he or she may retire. But we welcome it not only as a money saving measure. We welcome it because it may also ensure that the forces keep the expertise of their senior officers a little longer than they are currently managing to and because it removes posting difficulties caused when a senior officer leaves shortly after promotion. The final issue dealt with in the second Bill is the ironing out of a few administrative matters relating to the 1948 Defence Force retirement benefits (DFRB) and the 1973 Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the topic of the DFRDB, I shall move to a consideration of a slightly more substantial amendment in the first Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. The proposed option to commute a pension three months before retirement, commendable and welcome as it is, only points to the range of greater and more pressing problems which have not been addressed. The proposed option of early commutation will help to ease the all too common situation where an officer must wait for up to three months after retirement for his or her pension. In the past, pensioners have had to bridge this gap with expensive loans. But there is still much to be reviewed and improved in the area of benefits and allowances-retirement, death or otherwise. And what of the 2 per cent which was lopped off the Australian Defence Force (ADF) superannuants' pensions in 1986? Like the Australian taxpayer, the Defence Force pensioners are still waiting for the Government to honour its promise and share its prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is small wonder that in its report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force-the Cross report-the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommends a review of the DFRDB scheme to consider allowing optional deferral of pensions after age 55 with an incentive bonus; removing the 3 per cent a year penalty on those who separate early; and increasing the resignation benefit on termination before completing 20 years service to include an interest credit relative to the member's contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of housing. In 1980 $25,000 was about 55 per cent of the median purchase price of a home. Since 1980 the rise in the consumer price index has been 73 per cent and the defence service home loan is now effectively worth a paltry $14,500. It is ridiculous to keep the loan ceiling in 1988 at its 1980 level. Ever since I came into this Parliament I have been urging the Government to review it. My efforts were recently vindicated by the recommendations of the Cross wastage report which urge an immediate increase in the amount of the loan, draw attention to the need to restore eligibility to those post-1985 enlistees who are currently ineligible for a loan and outline an alternative defence service homes scheme based on a framework of grants and subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn then to the second amendment in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill which seeks to increase the Defence Housing Authority board membership to two. I particularly commend the appointment of Mrs Lorraine Sanderson to the Board. It is good to see a recognition by the Government of the need for service spouse input to Government policy in this area. After all, it is the families of service men and women whom this issue immediately affects. This provision should have gone through Parliament last year. The Opposition was ready and willing to facilitate the legislation but this time last year the Government clearly had other priorities, although I pushed for such an appointment from the inception of the Authority. I sincerely hope, however, that the Government will not rest on its laurels and that this appointment establishes a precedent for further spouse involvement in government consideration of service conditions. It is not enough to set up a national group of service spouses if their views are not channelled into purposeful implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of a new financial expert to the Defence Housing Authority board, however, puzzles and concerns me somewhat. Given the list of current board members and their respective qualifications, I would have thought there was a sufficiency of financial expertise already there. I can only wonder whether Defence central is playing its checks and balances game again. This country has suffered more than enough from that game as the Cross report on the management of Australia's defence demonstrated and the recent Cross report on personnel wastage reiterated. I shall be watching the performance of this board very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to the Defence Housing Authority leads me to raise some more concerns about the future of the Authority. Funding of the Authority is one such concern, since questions in last month's Estimates committee hearing brought me no closer to resolving whether the Government's $750m funding commitment to the Housing Authority was a grant or a loan. The matter must be resolved and be resolved quickly. I sincerely hope that it will be resolved in favour of a grant, since a loan would incur additional costs for the Authority and, presumably, there would be a reduction in the amount of housing which could be built or purchased at a time when housing needs are increasing due to the naval expansion westwards and the Royal Australian Air Force and Army expansion northwards. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the third amendment in Bill No. 1-the introduction of open-ended engagement conditions within the Services. This is certainly a measure worth trying since it has the potential to bring a valuable flexibility to what has traditionally been a major decision for a three-, six-, or nine-year engagement. It may also give service personnel a feeling of greater control over their own lives and it may promote a greater feeling of choosing a career rather than signing on for a term. I also hope that this measure will encourage personnel to stay longer than they are doing since precious little else encourages them to do so at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this legislation ignore the need for amendments to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal legislation. They ignore the need to undertake automatic regular reviews of pay and allowances independent of government and departmental intervention. In addition, while the Government openly encourages work-based child care as an added incentive to productivity and morale in other work environments, it completely ignores the desperate ADF need for child-care facilities. The little that has actually been achieved in this area has been achieved by the initiative of families themselves who have had to go cap in hand to the Government for financial support and, even now, only one of those centres has received any such support. </PARA>
<PARA> On that note I would like to turn for a moment to the consideration of the Naval Defence Amendment Bill, which is being dealt with cognately in this debate. The Bill seeks to enable civilian employees of the Defence Department who are currently employed at Garden Island in the Office of Defence Production to be transferred to a new company called Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd to be established next year. I want to establish from the outset that the Opposition is not opposed to this Bill. Quite the reverse. We support it because it seeks to provide privatisation of a kind not unlike its Williamstown counterpart. Our hope is that through a degree of privatisation, Australian Defence Industries will follow in Williamstown's footsteps. Having established Opposition support, however, the point that I would like to make in relation to this Bill is that while defence service men and women must pressure and fight and beg the Government for their allowances, the Defence Department's civil employees at Garden Island are being looked after very nicely, thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 (3) specifically protects the terms and conditions of service for Garden Island employees and ensures that their leave and superannuation entitlements are preserved. This is as it should be. Apart from sharing the concern of my colleague, Mr Tim Fischer, that this clause should not result in so much flexibility as to enable the continuation of rorts and inefficient work practices, I recognise that the interests of Garden Island employees have been adequately protected. However, I cannot help contrasting the lot of these civilian defence employees with that of their counterparts in the forces. If the needs and conditions of service for service men and women were monitored half as closely and looked after half as diligently as those of civilians, the Defence Force would not be suffering its current wastage crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government had devoted more time, money and effort to the defence personnel portfolio instead of being so unbending on equipment, a lot more meaningful action could have been taken than these insufficient and insubstantial few amendments which are before us today. The Cross report, for instance, recommended amendments to Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal legislation, telephone and postal subsidies, Medicare levy exemption where a spouse is in employment and amendments to the DFRDB and the defence service home loans legislation. But of even greater urgency than these legislative amendments is the resolution of the 150 to 200 matters awaiting determination in the Department of Industrial Relations. Some of them have been waiting for up to two years. Recently I have highlighted the notorious example of our men on the Iraq-Iran border who have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work but who have still not got their allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Opposition welcomes all of the proposed amendments but they are a poor lot when we review the matters to which the Government should be addressing its efforts. The realities in the Defence Force today are that men and women are doing a marvellous and demanding job defending Australia, but they are lacking the support from their Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the Statutory Instruments (Tabling and Disallowance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. This Bill, which principally seeks to amend certain provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, has the effect of closing two potential loopholes that would be open to a government which with ill intent wanted to avoid the scrutiny and disallowance provision safeguards of this Parliament. An enormous amount of law is now made in the form of delegated legislation, principally through regulations, and does not receive the same attention as legislation-that is, it is not required to be passed through both Houses of this Parliament. It is important, therefore, that there be an adequate safeguard procedure and that procedure is the disallowance mechanism which is contained principally in section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act. The effect of this section is that delegated legislation must be tabled in the Parliament. Within 15 days a motion for disallowance can be moved and then, I think, within another 15 days that motion must be disposed of. In other words, either House of Parliament has the capacity to disallow regulations so that they are no longer law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances brought to the attention of the Parliament-and I think to some extent it was relying on previous advice given to it by the then Secretary, Mr Peter O'Keefe, now a Clerk-Assistant of the Senate-that there are ways in which this disallowance mechanism can be avoided. Two ways have been raised and they are dealt with by the provisions of this Bill. The first is that it may be possible to circumvent the scrutiny procedure by not tabling regulations and remaking the identical regulations on the day after the expiration of the 15 sitting days tabling period. That could have the effect of indefinitely keeping the regulations in force. Clause 6 of the Bill before us seeks to close that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> The second loophole is closed by ensuring that regulations are not remade whilst subject to disallowance. I do not think either loophole has been used in recent years. However, I am told that such a device was used on a number of occasions in 1910. Nevertheless, the Parliament obviously has a responsibility to ensure that government meets not only the letter of the law but the spirit of the law. Because governments do not always meet the spirit of the law, this Act is being passed by the Parliament to close these loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems appropriate, Mr Deputy President, to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the work of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, its staff, and the Clerks. That Committee, as you know, has a responsibility on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise delegated legislation and to ensure that it is in accordance with the statute, that it does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, that it does not unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal, and that it does not contain matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to say that this Committee is the only body that effectively scrutinises the mass of delegated legislation and, therefore, it performs a magnificent service for the Parliament and for the democratic process itself. As you would also be aware, Mr Deputy President, this Committee has received great credit internationally for the work that it has done in ensuring that governments do not abuse their powers to make delegated legislation. It seems that this is just another occasion on which the Committee and its staff have brought to the attention of the Parliament ways in which the procedures can be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> We obviously support the legislation. We support the principal amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act and the consequential amendments that follow. We believe that potential loopholes-I am not suggesting that they would necessarily be used by this Government or a successive governments-are closed by these amendments. For those reasons, the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

Is it also true that in addition to these current problems the Government has directed that $300m is to be lopped off the logistic vote over the five-year defence program and, of this, the Army's share is $105m? Is it also a fact that this inability to do the job through a lack of funds is a major cause of soldiers quitting the forces?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not admit that they will gut the land forces capability. I apologise for running in late and trying to get down some parts of Senator Newman's question. I might say that, fortunately, today's question is somewhat shorter than those that I have been getting lately, which have gone on at some length. The question of wastage in the defence forces or indeed the Army, to which Senator Newman just referred, has, I think, received quite considerable publicity in recent days, particularly since the publication of the Cross report on Personnel Wastage in the Defence Force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the product to which Senator Black refers which Mr Peter Foster is supposedly promoting in Queensland. Apparently the product works on the basis that two drops are absorbed into the skin, thereby removing hunger pangs. I notice that Senator Boswell is rather interested in this-I cannot understand why! Mr Foster is promoting this product which he claims has this miracle cure. It is also in liquid form and it consists of 99.6 per cent alcohol and water. Senator Black referred to some of Mr Foster's previous history. It is true to say that Mr Foster did flee Britain leaving a warrant for his arrest and $50,000 bail, and he was involved in fraud relating to the marketing of Bai Lin tea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be said that this activity of Mr Foster's has been advertised in a number of newspapers including the Sunday Sun of 20 November this year. There have also been articles relating to the reaction from the Queensland Minister responsible for consumer affairs, Mr Vin Lester, to the claims and the product as promoted by Mr Foster. In fact, Mr Lester claims that Peter Foster is one of the State's most colourful con men. Obviously that is a big wrap for anyone in Queensland!</PARA>
<PARA> The particular problem that has been highlighted for consideration by the Trade Practices Commission is that the advertisements in relation to this product claim that the product has been tested by the Queensland Institute of Technology. I am advised by the Trade Practices Commission, which has contacted the Queensland Consumer Affairs Bureau, that this is not so. The Trade Practices Commission also had direct contact with the Queensland Institute of Technology, which also denied that it has tested the product. What has happened is that a market research branch of the Institute, Q Search, was approached to undertake limited market research on the product and establish consumer reaction to it. So we seem to have a breach of particularly section 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act. That section provides that a corporation shall not represent that it has sponsorship or approval that it does not have. I am currently awaiting more information from the Queensland Consumer Affairs Bureau with respect to this, but the Trade Practices Commission is in daily contact with it on this matter. The position is that, if no action is taken within Queensland on the substance and the misleading advertising, I will ask the Trade Practices Commission to act very promptly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. As a result of changes recommended by the World Heritage Bureau, the original boundaries nominated for World Heritage listing in north Queensland have been altered by excising 31 areas and adding eight, without making new regulations under the Conservation Act, which means that new areas are not protected and that legal logging has since taken place. It also means that there are areas still protected which are now no longer part of the nomination. In view of this fact, and considering that the Minister's office has had no contact with the Queensland Government since 30 September, thus ensuring that a joint management authority is impossible and that Federal legislation will be required for a management plan, does the Minister believe it is misleading to go to the World Heritage Bureau in December without bringing the appropriate regulations before Parliament and without introducing legislation allowing Commonwealth Government management of the listed site? Is he not, in fact, pre-empting proper parliamentary procedure by taking his amended proposals to Brasilia without the endorsement of the Australian Parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it staggering that Senator Boswell could say that the reason that there cannot be joint management of the wet tropics rainforest is that my office has not been in contact with the Queensland Government since 30 September. The great difficulty we have had throughout this whole exercise is that the Queensland Government has, time and again, failed to respond to my pleas and pleas from other people in this Government to sit down to talk about joint management. The Queensland Government will only do so if the Commonwealth will agree to its core area concept of three small core areas in which there is no logging throughout the rest of the wet tropics. This of course includes quotas of virgin forest to be logged because the industry cannot survive even on the much reduced quota of 60,000 cubic metres now given to it by the Queensland Government without going into virgin areas. The Commonwealth has made it clear from day one that this is not acceptable. Not only is it not acceptable to this Government but also the Queensland Government would not be spending the extraordinary sums of money in publicity and sending 30 people to Brasilia if it did not realise that this argument was going down like a lead balloon in all quarters.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that we do not need to have a management plan in place to nominate the area at the World Heritage meeting in December. Senator Boswell has always failed to understand that, first, there has never been a management plan for a great many places on the World Heritage List. Secondly, the Commonwealth has said that it will manage the area of north Queensland wet tropics on its own if it needs to do so. We shall undertake to do that next year. But it is my firm belief, and always has been, that even the Queensland Government will see the light of day and sit down to talk to us next year. If it does not do that after Brasilia, then all it will achieve is a delay of the payment of $75m to the citizens of north Queensland. If it tries to do that, the political odium at the end of the day will be too great, although one might say that, with its popularity ratings down into almost single figures, it does not really matter what it does; it is gone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney compliments Senator Aulich's question by pointing out that it is very difficult. I am sure that Senator Chaney would find it so but it just so happens that I am able to answer it. That is a comment on the relative merit of the Government and the Opposition in this place. The Australian Space Office signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Academy of Space Technology on 19 November, during the visit of the Chinese Premier. The agreement reflects the interest of the Chinese in further cooperation with Australia. Of course, it very largely stems from the decision by Aussat to use the Long March rocket for the launch of Aussat's next generation of satellites. It further stems from the fact that Australia and China have complementary interests in the commercial and scientific exploitation of space technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the visit of the Chinese Premier, I had two meetings with Mr Lin Zongtang, China's Minister for Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry. He told me that China was very appreciative of the Aussat decision and saw it as a base for considerable international commercial and other cooperation between the two countries. As I said, this in part explains the enthusiasm of the Chinese for exploring the possibility of other forms of space technology cooperation. There is no doubt that China benefits from cooperation with a technologically advanced country in developing its own capabilities and recognises that Australia is prepared to cooperate in mutually beneficial activities.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to give a couple of examples of the areas of potential cooperation which have been identified so far. The first is an oceanographic satellite which would allow for the identification, exploitation and management of offshore fisheries, and contribute to a number of other areas of marine study. Australia happens to have a fairly well advanced capacity, for example, in remote sensing. That is of considerable interest to the Chinese.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Childs for giving me some notice of this question. I was certainly concerned to read in the Illawarra Mercury that the very successful Illawarra Regional Organisation of Councils was considered to have a future that was `under threat'. I take this opportunity to explain very clearly the policy of the Office of Local Government in regard to funding regional organisations of councils. Such organisations are one way in which councils in diverse regions of Australia can come together and focus on the needs of those regions and work together across a broad range of issues, while at the same time maintaining their independence and their commitment to what they see as their immediate parochial needs. Senator Boswell will be interested to know that, thanks to Senator Richardson's initiative, a number of councils in the World Heritage listed area are looking at coming together in terms of cooperating in a community initiative package-but more of that at another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To come back to the Illawarra Regional Organisation of Councils, since 1984-85 this organisation has received $90,000 for secretarial support. We have what we believe is a very fair and equitable procedure of giving secretarial support to regional councils where they form for three years and three years only. We do that because resources are limited and have to be spent in the most responsible and fairest way. Where a regional organisation of councils establishes itself and is accepted by a group of councils in a region, if it is successful and contributing to the economy of the region, those councils themselves will, we hope, choose to contribute to the maintenance of the secretariat. I see no reason why the councils involved-and we are looking at councils as large as Wollongong, Shellharbour, Kiama, Shoalhaven and a number of other councils-if they want their regional councils to continue should not make a necessary contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> Bringing councils together in this way is a means of attracting a large degree of recognition to the region. Over the last three years the Illawarra region has attracted $268,000 from the Office of Local Government under its local government development program. This is precisely because, instead of competing with each other in regard to applications for funding, councils have been working on projects of benefit to the region. I hope that councils in the region will continue to fund the secretariat. They have been very successful, but I have a responsibility to other regions and to encourage other councils throughout Australia to take advantage of this program.</PARA>

Senator Stone has often been accused in the past, and I think justifiably so, of making a judgment about the state of the world without bothering to look at the evidence which might either support or contradict that judgment; and then when the evidence is forced upon him he selects that which supports his predetermined conclusion and ignores all that does not.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Stone cares to look at the figures for 1982-83, he will in fact find that in that year, as a proportion of GDP, private investment by businesses was 10.4 per cent-as compared with 12 per cent for this year-and that in 1982-83 private business investment in real terms fell by 12 1/2 per cent over the previous year. So the so-called resources boom to which Senator Stone was implicitly referring was well and truly over before the 1982-83 financial year, which was, of course, a year of appalling recession. There is no way that a valid argument can be mounted that the 4 per cent current account deficit in the final year of the Fraser-Howard regime was in any way attributable to a business investment boom. Indeed, we had a business investment slump.</PARA>
<PARA> After all this, it is no wonder that Dr Hewson said to me on Wednesday of last week, `Don't quote Stone at me'. However, Dr Hewson ought not complain because he cannot even copy out Hansard pinks accurately, as he displayed with a fairly silly press release he issued yesterday which purports to quote me as saying, `There is certainly no likelihood at this stage that it will be as much as than 4 per cent'. Finally, the estimate for private investment spending as a proportion of gross domestic product for this financial year, at 12 per cent, is the highest that it has been in any year since at least 1976-77, higher than it was in the year of the so-called resources boom in 1981-82, when it stood at 11.7 per cent.</PARA>

The figures show that between 1985-86 and 1987-88-that is, over a period of two years-wine exports, in volume terms, increased by 260 per cent, increasing by some 97 per cent in the first year and 83 per cent in the second year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to Senator Lewis that, in value terms, the growth was even more significant, from just over $20m to over $90m-an increase of 350 per cent. This shows that Australian wine of good quality is being appreciated by overseas buyers as well as by domestic consumers. So far for this financial year the export position has continued to improve. There has been a further 3 1/2 per cent increase in the volume of exports for the first two months of this financial year compared with the same two months of 1987-88. Even more significantly, again comparing those same two time periods, the value of exports has increased by almost 64 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, clearly this is an area which has potential, because the Australian product is both of good quality and competitively priced. The Government notes, as I am sure does everyone else, with considerable satisfaction the enormous percentage growth of exports of Australian wines. Those exports are currently earning somewhat more-that is, $90m-in export income, thereby, even on a net basis, taking probably $70m or thereabouts off our current account deficit. That just happens to be-and there is no functional relationship between these two figures either-the same amount that the Opposition, in opposing the tax legislation pertaining to bringing the gold industry into the same taxation net as all others, wants to hand over to Washington as unofficial foreign aid to the United States.</PARA>

But there have been no changes to the Budget assumptions because of the exchange rate being somewhat higher for the trade weighted index and, of course, higher again for the Australian-US dollar rate. As those facts imply, the change in the Australian-US dollar rate says perhaps more about the weakness of the US dollar than it does about the relative strength of the Australian dollar. However, the forecasts have not been adjusted, and it remains to be seen whether either the bilateral rate or the whole trade weighted index in the end is so far away from the present Budget estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it has to be acknowledged that the loss of the Nella Dan did cause some disruption to our program of research in the Antarctic last year and, in fact, has caused some disruption again to the program this year. Unfortunately that is something I suppose we will not resolve until the new Antarctic ship is completed, which I still expect to be towards the end of next year. Most of the reductions are reductions in programs for marine science research. Despite that, Australia will be conducting a major program of scientific research covering areas such as oceanography, glaciology, meteorology, environmental studies, life sciences, earth sciences and physics-a whole host. Fortunately, because we fairly quickly chartered the Lady Franklin, the replacement ship for the Nella Dan, we were still able to carry out a significant, although as I have admitted, reduced marine science program. A total of 128 scientists will carry out 139 projects at four Australian stations and three summer bases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that 30 of those programs will be concerned with climate change. Obviously the Antarctic is the area in the world, the most pristine wilderness area, which has relevance to studies on climate change. We have new and continuing programs on climate-related projects which will include investigations into the earth's upper atmosphere; gathering data on temperature, winds and gravity waves; obtaining measures of the ionosphere; determining seasonal variations in the earth's vertical electric field and, of course, monitoring the ozone layer above Macquarie Island. Obviously these are exciting programs.</PARA>
<PARA> I would particularly like to refer to the prospect this year of more deep ice drilling at Law Dome. We hope this will enable us to study climate change over the previous millennia and look at its relevance to current and future changes. We have provided research grants and logistic support to enable this extensive program to be carried out. I am more than confident that this year's program will contribute significantly not only to our knowledge of the Antarctic but hopefully to the prospects of climate change not just in our region but worldwide.</PARA>

Can the Minister confirm that science students who enrol for courses carrying more than the number of points required for a degree, and those exceptional students who undertake an even more arduous course of study, will have a tax liability of $1,800 per annum, the amount applying to all standard full time courses? If this is not the case, if students undertaking those extra units of study have to pay a higher tax, does not the Minister agree that this could act as a deterrent to the pursuit of academic excellence in scientific studies which, I am sure he would agree, would be against Australia's best interests?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a note on the more generalised issue. I think the short answer is that it is possible that a person who is enrolled for more than the normal one-year work load, will be charged more than $1,800 a year, but that there will be a considerable amount of discretion left to the institution, and the final decisions will be made by the institution. The written advice that I have is rather long and I will read just a few passages from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The higher education contribution scheme, which is being introduced in 1989, provides for an annual course contribution of $1,800, with each student's actual contribution being based on the equivalent full time study being undertaken by a student in a semester. The Commonwealth provides funding for higher education institutions based on the equivalent full time study load undertaken by students. So there is a symmetry there. But it is left to the institutions to determine within guidelines issued by the Commonwealth the standard annual program for a course. The guidelines provide for institutions to use the minimum credit points for a course, where these exist, or in other courses the normal annual student program.</PARA>
<PARA> A student's equivalent full time study in a semester is based on the actual subjects or units in which the student is enrolled relative to the standard program. Where a student undertakes a course involving more than the minimum number of points required for a degree or additional subjects, the additional student load is taken into account when assessing an institution's performance against its funded student load.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the reports to which Senator Crowley refers, most of which I think spring from evidence that was given before the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is chaired by Senator Black. I think they do give rise to considerable distress. I was quite worried at the evidence of growing use of drugs by some very young sports people, and I think that is something we should be very concerned about. I think the use of steroids by weightlifters is particularly distressing because, given the evidence that is now being presented, it is apparently widespread.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will concede that there is some degree of division within the sporting community and among some people who are in the practice of sports medicine, about drugs in sport, but I would not wish to overstate it. I still believe that overwhelmingly throughout the sporting organisations in Australia, and for most of those associated with sports medicine, there is still an abhorrence of the use of drugs by athletes. I would like to take this opportunity to restate the Government's position on this. The Government remains totally opposed to the use of drugs to enhance sporting performance, and that is not a position that is likely to change.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years we have been working on a number of ways to enforce that view. Via the auspices of the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport, we have actively supported the policies of the medical commission of the International Olympic Committee and its efforts to clear up this abuse. To that end, since I have returned from Seoul, I had talks with Olympic officials and with officials of the Institute of Sport, to impress upon them the need for, if you like, taking the hardest line possible on the question. If I am to present to Cabinet next year a new proposal on how we will fund sport in Australia, we will certainly be making the receipt of funds by sporting organisations dependent upon their expressed desire and demonstrated capacity to ensure that drugs are eliminated from their sports.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the national program of drugs in sports, which commenced in 1985. That program has gained worldwide respect. It employs a full time officer and it is overseen by an expert committee which is chaired by Dr Brian Corrigan, who I do not think has a real peer in the field of sports medicine in Australia. It has developed strategies, not just in my portfolio but in the Department of Community Services and Health, and has had a close liaison with the national campaign against drug abuse and the drug offensive. We are making the priorities drug testing, prevention by education, research and, of course, law enforcement and policy development.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories has been working to get international accreditation for drug testing. In the meantime it has achieved a notable success. We are advised that it will be able to carry out all national sports drug testing from 1 January 1989-12 months ahead of schedule. I congratulate it on the work it has done in getting to that stage so quickly. In the area of education, extensive resource materials have been made available to schools and more will be made available. As far as grants under the sports talent encouragement plan are concerned, all the talented athletes who get grants from the Government are, of course, subjected to random drug testing. Whatever happens next year in regard to any new submission, that system will be reinforced. I believe that if all sports associated with the reception of government funds cooperate-those that do not wish to cooperate can be made to-within the next few years we can see the elimination of the use of drugs in sport. That is something I intend to pursue with great vigour over the next couple of years.</PARA>

I thought that was what the existing arrangements effectively did. I thought that there was a research component paid to all institutions without any overall evaluation of the quality of the research being done. Indeed, as I understand it, one of the purposes that the Government had in mind for the policy was to try to get more valid, qualitative comparisons of what the institutions were doing. In one sense that inevitably involves a bit more centralisation, but I do not see how we can get the comparative, qualitative evaluation without, in some sense, having a bit more centralisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I take it from the Minister's reply that he does not support the quite ludicrous proposition advanced by the Treasurer in explaining away this shocking trade result; namely, that we are experiencing a manufacturing boom. I take it that the Minister, sensibly, does not endorse the Treasurer's assertion because he, probably unlike the Treasurer, is aware that in the main area which would be affected by any alleged manufacturing boom-that is, machinery imports-there has been hardly any change over recent months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, I agree in terms of high levels of investment in manufacturing. If that is what the Treasurer was saying-I do not recall precisely what he was referring to-I agree that the levels of investment in manufacturing are significant. They are particularly significant because the pattern of manufacturing investment has changed over the last few years. Both here and elsewhere much less manufacturing investment is taking place, for example, in greenfield sites, as it used to do, and in enormous plants and so on. A lot of manufacturing investment is directed towards smaller and more sophisticated pieces of equipment which make business and manufacturing plant work smarter, rather than the very large plants which we were used to in years gone by.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a question on defence housing at Enoggera Army barracks. It is true that there are some houses of poor standard in Bliss and Taurama streets, Enoggera, about which there was a report in the Brisbane media. Almost all of those houses have some problems. They are of immediate post-war prefabricated construction, are not capable of rehabilitation in any economically viable way, and need to be replaced with new housing. I am pleased to report that the linoleum floor coverings in the houses are being replaced progressively and that the ceilings were not sagging; rather, material covering the joins in plaster sheeting was missing. New timber cover strips are being installed. Pest control measures have been taken where necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that all honourable senators will appreciate that the Defence Housing Authority is not able to replace all the substandard defence housing at once. These are problems that have been accumulating for 30 years. However, the Authority has already commenced replacement programs in many areas. For example, over 300 replacement houses were purchased in a special acquisitions program in the last quarter of 1987-88 and it is planned that a further 1,079 replacement houses will be provided by the Authority this year. There is a portion of the Brisbane media's report to which Senator Bjelke-Petersen did not refer. It quotes a member of the National Consultative Group of Service Spouses working party, which inspected the Enoggera houses, as saying that the figure of 98 per cent `did not give a balanced view of the housing situation because only a small number of houses were inspected'. She went on to say that the Authority was working to eradicate poor housing conditions as funds became available and that members of that working party were pleased to have the opportunity to work with the Authority so that jobs could be prioritised. She also said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Enoggera houses inspected represented a few poor examples of service homes but the Defence Housing Authority is working to get people out of the bad ones as soon as better houses become available.</PARA>
<PARA>That is clear evidence that the Defence Housing Authority is not only getting on with its charter but is doing that in close consultation with its tenants.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper is a very important document because it deals with proposals for reform of the current Commonwealth Government purchasing system. That government purchasing takes place on a truly monumental scale. The report points out that in the 1986-87 Budget explanatory notes it was estimated that annual Commonwealth Budget expenditure on goods and services was about $8 billion. Some 3,500 people are employed in purchasing and related activities. Therefore, as the report points out, purchasing is a significant activity and plays a key role in supporting government programs. It is also of great significance because an enormous amount of taxpayers' money goes into government purchases. Indeed, all government purchases are funded one way or another from taxpayers' money. As we have seen through our pursuit of these issues in Estimates committees and other forums in this Parliament over recent years, the amount of waste in government expenditure is equally monumental. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important paper. It is also very odd; for example, it has no acknowledged author. There is no explanation of why it has been written, who commissioned it, prepared it or, indeed, where it came from. I would have thought that at the very least the authors of the report should have acknowledged their authorship and the terms of reference that they were given. I presume that it is the review report on tendering and purchasing promised in the Estimates committee for the Department of Administrative Services well over a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I welcome any report which investigates the process of government purchasing, the first question that has to be asked is: why has this taken so long? It is a follow-up, to some extent, of promises initially made by the Hawke Government when it came to office 5 1/2 years ago. The other point I wish to make is that, if the report were going to be tabled today, why was it not prepared in time for the Estimates committee hearings a few weeks ago? That would have given the Parliament the opportunity to question some of the very important points made in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes that are outlined to government purchasing policy and practices in the report are significant. They are also very interesting. They include the strategy to improve purchasing performance through a professional approach involving better practice and techniques and well-trained staff; the recognition of value for money as the prime purchasing objective and adoption of a principle of open and effective competition as a guide in determining purchasing methods; the removal of central regulatory control of detailed purchasing processes and procedures, leaving them to be decided by management; and the provision of a centrally provided policy framework and best practice guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time I had to examine the report, I found that it involves a less regulatory and more decentralised approach to government purchasing. That is important and a step in the right direction but it raises some very important further issues. For example, if we were to decentralise purchasing how would we be able to maintain the principles of probity, fairness and opportunity to compete for Commonwealth business, which principles are quite fundamental to the whole area of government purchasing and the proper accounting of the use of taxpayers' money? It also raises the whole question of how we are going to train skilled purchasing officers in the various government departments and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make in the time available is that, whilst I welcome the report, I question very much whether it is going far enough fast enough. It has taken a long time to eventuate. At the end of the day it does not tackle the fundamental problem that it really ought to tackle-that is, how is this Government going to get under control the enormous escalation of total government expenditure that has so dominated its period of office and has caused the fundamental problems that have beset the economy, particularly the enormous blow-out in the early years of the Government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a couple of things about the report entitled Proposals for Reform of Commonwealth Government Purchasing Arising from Government Review under the Financial Management Improvement Program. I agree with Senator Short that it has some valuable suggestions to make in an area where I am sure there are considerable public savings to be made. The recommendations are not recommendations which have been considered in detail by the Opposition. There has not been an opportunity to do that since the paper was tabled only today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that some of the recommendations reflect policies already announced by the Opposition. I welcome that fact. The review concludes that the Commonwealth has relied too heavily on the use of detailed technical specifications and endorses the greater use of functional specifications or performance specifications. This is specifically in line with coalition policy and therefore I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> The review also recommends enhanced requirements regarding public visibility and accountability, an emphasis on flexibility and management for results and generally a more competitive value for money approach. I might say that they are all the right words. I merely draw attention to the fact that translating those words into procedures which will work may be rather more difficult. I have no doubt that the Government will need to direct its attention to meeting the suggestion in the report that, given that there will be greater local discretion, there will be a need for a different sort of control if we are to avoid the risk of abuse of purchasing procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 11 of the report says that a code of ethics will be promulgated to give guidance on expected standards of honesty and behaviour. I would agree with the implication from that that any system of purchasing does require a high ethical standard on the part of the persons who are actually doing the purchasing on behalf of the Commonwealth. I remind the Senate that we are talking about $8 billion worth of expenditure here. We are not talking about small change for taxpayers. We are talking about very large contributions, payments which are well in excess of the annual cost of the old age pension. Obviously, there will be an interest on the part of the Opposition to see what code of ethics will be promulgated. We will also be interested to see what these enhanced requirements regarding public visibility and accountability involve. I simply draw to the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is at the table, that we would be anxious to see a further statement from the Government and a further opening up to debate of these issues by the publication at the earliest possible time of both the code of ethics and the enhanced requirements regarding public visibility and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The review was not undertaken from the industry policy viewpoint, although we are advised in the report that industry was consulted and that no disadvantage to local industry is anticipated from implementation of the proposed reform. The fact is that the new simplified procedures which give purchasing officers a much greater degree of discretion could be open to abuse. I acknowledge that the current very rigid procedures can also be manipulated if that is something that a purchasing officer might want to do, for example, through changes to tender specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of this report it appears that the new procedures offer scope for cost savings and benefits to industry through greater flexibility in competition. But I ask the Government to bear in mind the need to ensure that there is this public visibility and accountability and to ensure that the new rules which will be needed actually to put these proposals into operation are made available to us at the earliest possible time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>There is, as always, in the annual report of the Department of Community Services and Health a great deal that one could comment on. However, I will restrict my remarks to chapter 5, which deals with the program of assistance for people with disabilities. Specifically, I want to address my remarks to the attendant care scheme. We are informed in the report that during 1987-88 a total of 64 people with disabilities were assisted under the attendant care scheme. The scheme started in April 1987 with a budget of $11m over three years to assist up to 360 severely physically disabled people to move from nursing homes into community accommodation through the provision of personal care services. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently visited by a group of people from the Attendant Care Coalition in my home State of Victoria who expressed to me considerable concern about the operations of the attendant care program from a number of points of view. Most specifically, these related to the limitations that are part of the scheme at the moment. It is very difficult to qualify for attendant care. One has to have been in nursing home care for a period longer than six months. One of the people who came to see me, Mary Reid, has relatively recently been able to get onto the attendant care program after a long period in a nursing home. Another person there was a school teacher who relatively recently had had an accident. Through the attendant care program he is able to remain in his own home and maintain normal family relationships with his wife and two young children and perhaps, even more importantly, return to his school as vice-principal and to make a major contribution in the community. It does seem very much to me that it would be in all our interests and in the interests of government, which has to pay for these things, to broaden the scope of a scheme such as the attendant care scheme. It needs to be seen as an integral part of our support for people with disabilities, particularly in the area of income security. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Cliff Wise, the school teacher I have referred to. Looking at the actual figures involved, because he is now back in productive work and because his wife has not had to stay at home and look after him full time, as she might have had to do under different circumstances, she is able to make an economic contribution as well. Indeed, figures supplied to me show that the net cost of attendant care in this case would be $16,945. The unemployment benefit that would have had to be paid to him if he were not able to be employed would be $5,500 plus associated benefits. All up, the cost per person would be under $11,000. In this case we have two productive members of the community in work paying taxes far above what the cost to the community and to the Government would be. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems with this scheme. One thing that I think needs to be borne in mind is that it is a three-year trial. The trial period is coming to its last year and yet it really has not had a fair trial in the view of those people who should know best-the disabled in the community-because of the restrictions that have been placed on it. It has been put to me, and I have put it to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) today by way of questions that the criteria should be extended to include people who are currently in rehabilitation or acute care and people who are at risk of being institutionalised in order to get them into attendant care before they become institutionalised. The criteria should also include those who are currently living with family or friends so that they and their family or friends need not be dependent and can be economically viable. People currently living in other institutional settings other than in nursing homes-for instance, people in hostels-would be more easily rehabilitated and more easily able to take up this scheme. The hours need to be extended as well. Too short a period is available under the program. I urge the Government to look seriously at extending the program's range and depth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing the Department of Community Services and Health annual report. Like other senators in the chamber, I am unable to comment on all aspects of the report in the time available since it covers such a wide area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to talk about two areas: one is in chapter two, the health advancement program and the other is in chapter four, the residential care for older people program. In chapter two we read about drug abuse reduction. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> More than $3.7 million for drug education programs and over $9.91 million for treatment and rehabilitation activities in States and Territories was provided by the Commonwealth under the cost-shared program with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty pilot tests of innovative approaches to drug abuse prevention were funded. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether in those statements the report is referring to $50,000 per annum that has been given by the Commonwealth, which was announced in a press release, to university medical schools to develop drug programs for medical students to teach them about drug abuse and educate them in drug rehabilitation. It was of concern to me when I read about this, since it seemed excessive to give $50,000 to a medical school for this project when, I thought, given my experience in tertiary institutions, maybe those people could also have been asked to develop programs in drug rehabilitation and education for psychologists, nurses, and teachers in Diploma of Education and other areas. It did seem to me that it was a rather narrow view of who should be educated about drug rehabilitation and abuse. I hope the Department will look at that matter and review the spending of that money and maybe have some expectation after the implementation in this first year that in the second and subsequent years that money is also shared across other faculties and departments in order to spread the value of that project around. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment about the residential care for older people program and to look specifically at chapter four. I express my concern about the fact that all the developments that have taken place in the review of care for the aged over the last two years I believe have neglected the elderly. One can see as one looks through chapter four that again the summary of what has happened over the past year emphasises this fact. On page 27, under the assessment section, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The objective of this subprogram is to ensure that aged people who seek residential care gain access to the most appropriate available services. </PARA>
<PARA>That might be applicable if a person lives close to the appropriate available services; that is, approved nursing homes. But if a person happens to live in a rural area in Victoria near a Bush Nursing hospital which is not an approved service for the elderly, if there is not private medical care-as we know private health insurance is not able to sustain people in long term care and is withdrawing its support for elderly people in these areas-then, in fact, the objective is not being met. I ask the Department, the people in this area and the Government to reassess and redirect their energies to ensure that some flexibility is brought into the system so that the needs of elderly people who require nursing home type accommodation are met. I do not think they are being met and I think that this matter needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that concerns me in the report is the geriatric assessment program. We have had numerous complaints from nursing home proprietors. They are not all vexatious, they are genuine complaints where someone has made an error in assessment and has changed the status of an elderly person because he has had a stroke and has suddenly become more dependent and he cannot be reassessed for a year. This applies to people who also come from other nursing homes. I believe that the Department needs to address some of the problems that are associated with assessment. There are a number of other issues which I would like to address. I may have the opportunity to do so later. They are issues about categories and exempt bed arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to comment on the annual report of the Department of Community Services and Health. This is the first report of the Department in its new revamped form. It was restructured on instructions from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 24 July 1987. The report covers a wide range of activities of community service programs. I, too, like Senator Powell, would like to comment on chapter five, the assistance for people with disabilities program. However, my comments will not be in the attendant care area but will deal more with the question of supported employment, or sheltered workshops as we used to call them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have to be the first to admit that the Government, in changing the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 to the Disability Services Act 1986, has attempted to perhaps bring more disabled people into the work force or into the community and give them the support that they need. However, there are some areas, I believe, where this is not occurring in the most efficient way and I do not believe that it is occurring in the best interests of the people involved or in the best interests of the community at large. It is rather unfortunate that, in practice, it does not seem to be working. The transition programs dealing with supported employment, referred to in the report, comment on this. A previous Minister for Community Services who dealt with this matter, Senator Grimes, made the statement that when the transition programs commenced and the new Disability Services Act of 1986 came into being, nobody would be worse off; everybody would be better off. My experience, short as it has been, in dealing with people in sheltered workshops and talking to people who are involved with them indicates that they too would echo the fact that they are worse off, and it is not really a question of the Government being lousy with funds. It has increased funding to a reasonable level. What is happening in the transition program, with the Government's idea of trying to bring more people out into the open community from their sheltered or protected employment schemes, is that for every person or every two or three persons taken out of the sheltered workshop environment one has to provide minders or supporters to accompany them, thereby increasing the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, in the particular schemes those persons were involved in, they would have been at the highest end of the people able to cope and to show some leadership in those areas. From my experience of talking to them and observing them, they would probably have a supervisory role in a sheltered workshop scheme. By taking them out of the scheme the Government not only disadvantages the scheme but it leaves a gap or two in the workshop, which means that someone from outside has to be employed to take over that position. Then on the other side one has to provide supporters for the disabled or mentally disabled people who are moving out into the community. All these people have to be funded, and unfortunately the funding is coming out of the same pool that the sheltered workshops or supported employment schemes are being funded by. So instead of being better off, they are worse off; so much so that last year very little money was available for new plant and maintenance, and a lot of these schemes are in jeopardy because they do not have the funds to maintain their equipment and to buy new equipment to ensure that these small industries are viable and remain so. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a useful report because of the large amount of statistical data which it provides in relation to Australia's health. However, it is a flawed report because of the extent to which-for reasons which are obviously political-it opens with a fairly detailed discussion of the past history of Australia's health policy in what I regard to be a highly contentious, highly political, highly inaccurate and quite improper fashion. The comments go well beyond what any statutory authority such as this should. On page 7 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of opposition from private health insurance funds and the medical profession, a Liberal-Country Party coalition Government elected in 1975 made a number of changes to Medibank over the next six years. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on to discuss these and other matters. Madam Acting Deputy President, that is simply a grossly inaccurate, improper, political statement which implies that the changes made in the Medibank arrangements by the Government which was elected in 1975 were made as a result of pressures from private health insurance funds and the medical profession. That is a political statement. It is not a statement which an institution such as the Australian Institute of Health-a statutory body-is entitled to make in a report which is supposed to deal with Australia's health statistics. I object most strongly to the editorialising which has taken place in the opening chapter of this report and I remind the authors of the report that they will certainly not continue to receive bipartisan political support for the work of the Institute if they are going to take upon themselves the making of partisan and party political statements by way of analysis of Australia's health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal could be said about this report, but I draw attention only to a couple of things which I think are objectionable. The first is the description of the AIDS epidemic on page 9, which is described simply as `incurable AIDS'. That may be an accurate reflection of the current prognosis, but what this report ought to say is that AIDS is a disease for which, at the moment, no cure is available. `incurable AIDS' is not a recognised disease. One hopes and prays that there will be a cure for AIDS. I think it is most misleading for the report to make this assertion which implies AIDS will always be incurable.</PARA>
<PARA> The report also refers to a number of relationships between health care and other community policies. For instance, on page 103 it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments could have their greatest impact on health by reducing socioeconomic disadvantage through programs that reduce unemployment and improve social security and community support services. </PARA>
<PARA>As we heard today from the speech just concluded by Senator Calvert, one of the things this Government is doing is cutting back on the effectiveness of some of those community support services. In terms of its record as far as poverty is concerned I make the point that while the Hawke Government has been in office the number of children living in poverty has dramatically increased. If this report were to be accurate and even-handed in making its political comments about health policy, it would have drawn attention to that rather than simply seeking to criticise one side of the political debate on health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it somewhat confusing to be told in some parts of the report that some of the diseases resulting from unhealthy lifestyles have decreased, without having properly drawn to my attention at the same time the ongoing problem of disease or death resulting from increasing tobacco consumption. I find it somewhat misleading to look at the statistics on the significantly increasing cost of outpatient treatment without any attempt to indicate that this is one of the necessary consequences of the Government's Medicare policies, which are elsewhere in the report praised as having some alleged value in terms of social equity. I do not wish to continue at great length, because I propose to speak at some other time on this report. I simply make the point that the health statistics in this document are valuable and important. The political editorial comment with which the report is shot through is a disgrace and something to which the Opposition objects very strongly. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In April this year the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for inquiry and report Professor Max Neutze's paper entitled The Canberra Leasehold System. The paper had been commissioned in 1987 by the former Joint Committee on the ACT in response to a growing perception that the administrators of the leasehold system were not using the strengths of the system effectively to ensure balanced, harmonious redevelopment of Canberra particularly in Civic. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives also referred to its Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, a reference covering all aspects of the ACT leasehold system including consideration and use of Professor Neutze's paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolutions referring the matter to the respective Standing Committees also empowered the Committees to sit as a Joint Sub-Committee to consider the ACT leasehold system. This report was prepared by the Joint Sub-Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, which includes a minority report, looks at the establishment and functions of the leasehold system, including reasons for leasehold, the concept of leasehold and functions of leasehold tenure, as well as leases and lease ordinances and benefits of the leasehold system. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues which the Joint Sub-Committee addressed cover a range of specific aspects of the leasehold system such as length of lease, responsibility for planning and estate management, role of lease administration in redevelopment, effects of plans on planning and development authorities and private sector involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> An area in which concern was expressed to the Joint Sub-Committee was in the administration of the leasehold system. There was concern with the way the Administration carried out its ground landlord role. Several areas where administrative reform is needed have been identified in Chapter 4. These include amendments to lease purpose clauses, betterment, breach of purpose clauses, ordinance simplification and consolidation and development rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final chapter the Joint Sub-Committee addressed the question of public participation. Public participation is the essence of the political process and it is necessary and vital to the effective functioning of Canberra's leasehold system of land tenure. There are three areas where public participation, openness and accountability can be enhanced in the operation of the leasehold system of land tenure. These are public participation in planning decisions, section 11a City Area Leases Ordinance and Section 17 City Area Leases Ordinance and Section 72a Real Property Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made 18 recommendations. In recommendation 1 the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth retain ownership of land in the ACT. Section 125 of the Constitution states in part, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee recognise that Canberra land is both a national heritage to be safeguarded and used for the benefit of the nation and also of vital importance to residents and that the leasehold system provides an effective means of reconciling these qualities. </PARA>
<PARA> Leasehold has provided a structure for planned, orderly and predictable development, and has prevented speculation. It has ensured certainty and lessees know they have an enforceable contract in which rights and obligations are clear. It is also clear from the rate of development and redevelopment that the claim by a few large developers that the leasehold system has been a disincentive to investors is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 2 the Committee affirms the view that the leasehold system of property tenure provides an effective basis for land planning and management in the ACT and that it should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee believes that the system of public ownership of land with leasehold tenure has the capability to continue to serve the needs of the ACT at both the national and territorial level. However, there are weaknesses and deficiencies with the administration of the leasehold tenure system which has allowed Canberra land to be treated as the property of lessees. These areas are identified in Chapter 4 and recommendations 9 to 13 address these administrative weaknesses and deficiencies. Not only has the Committee made recommendations which address administrative deficiencies but the Committee has also made recommendations on specific aspects of the leasehold system such as length of lease, responsibility for planning and estate management, role of lease administration and redevelopment, adherence to approved policy and development plans and private sector involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> One area which directly touches most residents of Canberra is residential leases. The Committee was aware of the special consideration which residential leases merit. The desire to hand down one's home and property from one generation to the next is a feature of the Australian sentiment and culture. Residential leases in Canberra are granted for 99 years and at present these leases will be renewed at the end of their term without the payment of a further premium. Although renewal of residential leases has been taking place there is no legislation to give effect to this. By amending the City Area Leases Ordinance (CALO) to incorporate a statutory right of renewal of residential leases, residential lessees would have the security of knowing that their leases will be renewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the majority of the Committee has recommended that the City Area Leases Ordinance be amended to provide for the automatic renewal of residential leases at the end of 99 years without further charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendation approximates residential leases in perpetuity but the lease purpose clause still controls land use, and development rights are still clearly retained by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an ongoing argument that leases should be converted to leases in perpetuity. One of the difficulties with perpetual leasehold is that it is fraught with contractual problems. The proposal for leases in perpetuity has been pressed by those concerned about the attractiveness of Canberra for investment purposes. However it is quite clear that the leasehold system has not been a disincentive to investment as some people have argued. The value of the leasehold system for developers is reflected in a statement made by the founder and then Managing Director of Lend Lease Corporation, Mr Dusseldorp. He said and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>As to the principle when they put it up for auction, not only did every bidder know exactly what he could and could not do with his particular site, but he also knew what everyone else-the other eleven owners in that particular city block-could and could not do. So that one doesn't have to fear as to what is going to happen next door to him, what is going to happen in front of him. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee has recommended that leases should be for a term of years rather than in perpetuity. Residential leases should be for 99 years. Non-residential leases should be for 99 years or for shorter periods and their renewal should be at the discretion of, and on terms negotiated with, the ground landlord, and will include the payment of a further premium. </PARA>
<PARA> Four of the Committee's recommendations address public participation in planning decisions, public notification of changes to lease purpose and public information. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lack of co-ordination and consultation between the planning and estate administration authorities. The Committee sounds a warning that in the planning and development of Canberra, it must not be forgotten that Canberra is a national heritage to be safeguarded for all Australians. This is one of the major reasons why the majority of the Committee recommend the retention of the leasehold system of land tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed to the inquiry through submissions, to Professor Neutze for his invaluable paper and to the Secretary and staff of the Joint Sub-Committee Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I guess from time to time the Labor Party wants to create the perception of having embraced a private enterprise economic system. Certainly, with the notable exception of the labour market, which matter the Government has put in the too hard basket, Australia has moved towards a deregulated economic environment. This country is now exposed to the competitive winds of rational investment. Canberra, above all, can ill afford to be isolated by a tenure system that will severely impede its ability to attract and maintain long-term acceptable investment. Yet, the majority report of the Committee on the ACT leasehold system, tabled today, seeks to do precisely that. It flies in the face of economic as well as social reality. There is no reasoned view why residents of the ACT should be refused freehold or perpetual leasehold-a right enjoyed by other Australians. For these reasons, I have presented a minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the existing leasehold system the Government in Canberra acts as both ground landlord and the planning authority, presumably to ensure the efficient and orderly development of the city. Public ownership of the site of Canberra and leasehold tenure for both business and residential use, were adopted some 80 years ago to ensure `orderly development of the city in line with the adopted plan and to avoid scattered development and land speculation'. But what about Government speculation? This is obvious everywhere if one drives through Canberra's inner city. One sees sites reserved for future use-when the value has risen handsomely. A fine cop. </PARA>
<PARA> This kind of `orderly development'-as Professor Max Neutze, author of the report commissioned by the then Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, would have us believe-is sitting on resources which would otherwise be fruitfully used. It is, at least in the short term, severely reducing potential government revenue. It also escalates costs associated with other developments in outer areas of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Freehold tenure is a key element of our social and economic structure-part of our national ethos. The idea of land tenure based on the principle of freehold has been widely accepted, in particular, for residential property. Indeed, current figures confirm that about 69 per cent of Australians either own or are in the process of buying their own home. This is a broad acceptance that freehold ownership gives greater security of tenure. In fact, the ACT has about 68 per cent home ownership, the second lowest among all the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Even that great advocate of fixed term leasehold, to whom I referred earlier, Professor Max Neutze, upon whose advice the majority report tabled today is largely based, has acknowledged Australians' preference for a freehold system. In a paper delivered in 1986 entitled `Planning and Land Tenure in Canberra after Sixty Years', he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians have never understood or, to the extent they have understood, have never supported a leasehold system. It seems certain that if they ever did understand it, very few still understood and supported it by 1970. The fact that as early as the late twenties there were successful efforts to get purpose clauses and other terms of leases varied suggests that few people believed in one of the fundamental aspects of leasehold: that it is the role of the ground landlord to determine the purpose for which a lease can be used and that the lessee has to conform to that purpose or renegotiate the lease. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the major concerns with the majority report is its recommendation relating to lease length. It claims leases should be for a set term, rather than in perpetuity, that is, residential leases should be for 99 years, with provision for renewal for a further 99 years, while business leases should also normally be for 99 years. If this is to be the case, why not have a freehold system or at least perpetual leasehold? After all, the reasons for limited leasehold tenure being introduced were to prevent speculation in land resulting from the siting of the national capital. It also enabled the Government to defray the costs of establishing and maintaining the capital through revenue derived from land rents and to distribute profits made from the increase in the value of land throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of land rent and the emergence of a more developed city are two major changes which have made this reasoning redundant. Justice Else-Mitchell's inquiry into land tenure reported in 1976:</PARA>
<PARA>Residential land in the ACT should be held under perpetual leases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is claimed that fixed term leases allow the government to encourage redevelopment by precipitating a land-use change at lease expiry. On the contrary, such a system hinders potential redevelopment in the last 20 or 30 years of a lease period by creating uncertainty about future tenure and therefore the value of current sites. Redevelopment is a response to market force, not lease term, and will be most encouraged by the certainty of tenure which freehold or perpetual leasehold provides. If one looks closely at the leasehold system, one sees that the underpinning theme is one of the facilitation of planning. Elsewhere in Australia, planning is supported by a wide variety of statutory planning systems at both the State and local government level. It seems that there are some individuals amongst us who regard the private sector to be the bete noir, to be nothing more than a huge impediment to the administration of land for the public good. The view that limited leasehold facilitates planning and estate management gives absolutely no consideration to how those functions can be as efficiently performed through the familiar statutory planning systems of the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Land utilisation in Canberra and the ACT should be of national concern, but self-government combined with the role played by the Commonwealth Parliament should be sufficient to ensure that both the local and the national interests are fully considered. The argument that a leasehold should be set to a period of 99 years is completely nonsensical. Why not five, 10, 15 or 20? This reinforces a far more practical view that a statutory planning system coupled with freehold or perpetual leasehold makes good sense. Perpetual leasehold would enable easier administration than the present system, would not weaken the planning function of the lease purpose clause and would permit unearned value increments to be recouped when changes in lease purpose occur. It would also make the leasehold system more acceptable to the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Business leases should in fact not be treated any differently from residential leasehold. The argument that business or commercial leases should reflect the expected life span of most buildings ignores the fact that elsewhere planning permission from local government is always required for redevelopment of commercial property to ensure the redevelopment is consistent with community aspirations. If private enterprise is to play a greater role in the development of Canberra, which it must, given that more private sector employment in Canberra is a major socioeconomic goal, its role in decisions concerning that development must be allowed to broaden. When compared with its role in other Australian cities, the private sector's role in Canberra has always been restricted. Private sector involvement in the ACT has been limited to the implementation of much of the National Capital Development Commission's program in design and contract documentation and by carrying out all works; the provision of local services and facilities by private contractors and investors; and the establishment of commercial enterprises directed at the `export' market. </PARA>
<PARA> The following four arguments support a change to freehold or at least perpetual leasehold: First, lease renewal as the primary planning tool provides fragmented redevelopment because leases may expire at different times. Secondly, heritage listings interfere with redevelopment on lease expiry and in effect provide for perpetual leasehold. Thirdly, interstate investors may well be more attracted to privately developed land under a freehold or perpetual leasehold system. Fourthly, the limited leasehold system requires more administration than is necessary because all property has to undergo a process of review for the purposes of lease renewal, regardless of whether there is any redevelopment or change in land use proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The only obstacle preventing adoption of the freehold system may be a constitutional one, for it is a fact that Commonwealth interests in the national capital are well protected by the Constitution. Section 125 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible that this may be interpreted so as to prevent freeholding of land in Canberra. But it certainly would not prevent the perpetual leasehold option. Eighty years ago there may have been good reason why the Government of the day indulged in public ownership, and why the limited leasehold system of land tenure conferred great planning advantages on a growing city. Today, however, as this nation approaches the twenty-first century, there is no legitimate reason for an ideological commitment to state control of land. Particularly, as a Liberal, it is anathema to me. Since the Australian dream of home ownership has been realised by about 70 per cent of this country's population, it seems an absurd situation that those Australians who happen to live in the ACT, and not in Victoria or New South Wales, or anywhere else, should be denied the aspiration of either full freehold ownership or effective freehold in the form of perpetual lease, if the Constitution prevents full freehold. I therefore commend my minority report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This is the second Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The Report is concerned with the organisational structure of the Australian Electoral Commission and in particular, whether the Commission should continue to have 148 Divisional Offices. The Report is of vital interest to all Members of the Federal Parliament and indeed all voters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report details the Committee's findings from its Inquiry into a 1987 Efficiency Scrutiny of the Divisional structure of the Electoral Commission. The Scrutiny was conducted by Dianne Saunders, the Deputy Electoral Officer for Victoria, and recommended that up to seven Divisional Offices be amalgamated to form Regional Offices to reduce costs and allow office computerisation to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report is called `Is this where I pay the electricity bill?'. This title may seem a little strange but I shall explain its origin. During the Inquiry the Efficiency Scrutineer, Dianne Saunders, told the Committee: ``If you go around the divisional offices to talk to staff about something, it is most unusual for somebody to come into the office. They are often there to pay the electricity bill anyway-they have mistaken us for the electricity commission. In fact, we had the official opening of the new office for the division of McEwen when the new division was set up, and we were all there with Lady McEwen and various members to have the official opening ceremony, and a gentleman walked in saying, `Is this where I pay the electricity bill?'!''</PARA>
<PARA> This anecdote typifies the difficulty that many Australians have in understanding the role of the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Submissions and evidence received by the Committee have shown there to be clear differences of opinion between the Electoral Commission, the Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association (the ACOA), Divisional Returning Officers (DROs) and others as to the best organisational structure for the Electoral Commission. While the Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, and other senior staff of the Commission have argued strongly in favour of regionalising the Commission's Divisional Offices, most of the submissions and evidence received by the Committee have argued for a continuation of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> In its Inquiry the Committee has considered a number of important issues. The issue of computers in the Electoral Commission has been of particular concern and the Committee has found there to be an urgent need for the Electoral Commission to make better use of modern computer systems. The Committee believes it is a serious deficiency in the Commission that its existing computer systems cannot cope with all the demands placed upon them and that some systems such as finance and personnel systems are not computerised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has concluded that as a matter of priority the Australian Electoral Commission must pursue the acquisition of modern computer equipment and the Committee has made two recommendations in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission seek independent external advice on the computer equipment and systems needed in the Commission's offices which would enable the Commission to best achieve its goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission adopt a more determined approach in seeking funds from the Government for the purpose of acquiring the modern computer equipment and systems it needs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee's major recommendations relate to the organisation of the Commission's Divisional Offices. In reaching its conclusions and recommendations on regionalisation the Committee has sought to consider broad issues rather than examine electorates on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACOA, DROs and some parliamentarians argued that having an Electoral Commission Office in each Division provided a more convenient service to electors and ensured DROs had better local knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that in some, but not all cases, DROs have developed extensive local knowledge under the existing Divisional Office structure. However, a Regional Office structure should not preclude staff from gaining local knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee understands from evidence received during its Inquiry that in most Divisional Offices, no more than 15 electors visit the Office during a typical week and that most enquiries are dealt with by phone or by mail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that regionalisation of up to three Divisional Offices in metropolitan areas would not seriously affect roll maintenance, election management or service to electors because of the transport and communications services which are available in these areas. However, the Committee concluded that regionalisation should not proceed in rural areas because of the distances involved and the resulting transport and communications barriers which would affect service to electors and election management. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee has been presented with different regionalisation schemes it has had no desire to draft specific proposals for the regionalisation of metropolitan offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes the task of formulating a final regionalisation scheme to be the responsibility of the Australian Electoral Commission and the Government. However, the Committee may wish to comment on the Electoral Commission's proposal for regionalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has therefore recommended that regionalisation of the Australian Electoral Commission's Divisional Offices only occur in metropolitan areas. The Regional Offices should be formed by the combination of up to three Divisional Offices. The Committee recommends that senior staff within a metropolitan Regional Office at the Administrative Service Officer 4, 5 or 6 level have continuing responsibility for specific Divisions and be designated as Divisional Returning Officers for specific Divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in concluding I would like to thank all those who contributed to the Committee's Inquiry and in particular, the Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes; the Efficiency Scrutineer, Dianne Saunders; and those DROs who made submissions to the Committee. Similarly, the Committee also thanks Julie Pagonis from the ACOA and Members of this Parliament for their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is grateful for the work undertaken by its staff and on behalf of the Committee I thank them: Mrs Helen Misa (``Missa''), Mrs Lexia Noakes and Trevor Rowe, the Committee's Secretary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I would like to make some very brief remarks about this report. The inquiry essentially concerned the efficiency scrutiny conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission in relation to its operations and the proposals in the efficiency scrutiny report for a system of regionalisation of Australian Electoral Commission divisional offices. The Committee received a considerable number of submissions, and these are referred to in the tabling speech. The Committee recognised that, although only a few persons actually pass through the door of Electoral Commission divisional offices-an average of, say, 15 persons a week-nevertheless quite a substantial volume of work is undertaken by the staff of the Commission. There are some 10 million voters in Australia and each year there are some two million to three million changes to the electoral data in respect of the electoral rolls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, under section 92 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act officers of the Australian Electoral Commission must undertake a habitation review. The workload of the Commission's divisional officers is lumpy. There is no real way to overcome that problem unless we have more and more elections. That would make the workload less lumpy and more sustained. However, the Committee considered the report and the question of efficiency and, most importantly, whether the efficiency scrutiny took sufficient account of the democratic principle. We have come up with a recommendation for the amalgamation of divisional offices in metropolitan areas to enable three divisional officers to conduct the Commission's business from the same office. This will not apply in non-metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We received a number of submissions from members of the House of Representatives and the Senate and we also received representations from, for example, the Burnie City Council. That is an interesting example. The Commission's efficiency scrutiny suggested that the divisional office for the electoral division of Braddon should be transferred from Burnie, where it is at the moment, to Launceston. Those who know Tasmania would be aware that such a move would make it extremely difficult for someone living on the west coast of Tasmania to visit the divisional office of Braddon, because it would mean going right down to Launceston. It is not a great distance but, because of the terrain, it would take quite some time. Essentially, we considered the social and economic costs and the important democratic principle in arriving at our conclusions. I might add that our conclusions and our recommendations are unanimous, the Committee's membership comprising representatives from the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats and me. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>On 1 September I moved a motion which was carried by the Senate on the following day. The motion read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the Table of the Senate, on or before 25 November 1988, details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, together with a statement of reasons for their non-proclamation and a timetable for their operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The hope is that this is the first of what might become a regular exercise. In fact, it is something that has exercised the minds of a number of senators for quite some time. The last major step in this area was taken on the initiative of Senator Peter Rae, who is now a Minister in the Tasmanian Government, when he gave a notice of motion which required notification to be given when a Bill that had passed this Parliament was actually proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that many people realise that there are a number of stages in the operation of Bills. The fact that this Parliament has passed a piece of legislation does not necessarily mean that anything will happen with it. There are two further steps: the royal assent, which is a formal exercise, and then the actual proclamation date. I note that Senator Puplick is flicking through this paper. He has raised this question from time to time in the various Estimates committees. It is interesting that, after a brief look at this paper, I have found details of 57 Bills. I think people should take note of that. It is all very well to know which Bills are proclaimed. That already occurs, the information being tabled by the Clerk from time to time. However, what we do not know is which Bills are not proclaimed. Unless one has a massive indexing exercise and manages to keep on top of it, most senators would not know, but some fascinating things happen. What we have in fact done, by the mechanism under which Bills are drafted, is hand over effective legislative powers to the bureaucrats. When one goes through this list and sees some of the reasons why Acts passed by this Parliament have not been proclaimed, one is astonished. For example, on the very first page there appears this statement in relation to sections of the Goods, Works and Services Act 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>These sections relate to preferential buying of Australian goods by Commonwealth authorities and provoked considerable and continued Ministerial and bureaucratic opposition on enactment. They were therefore not proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>This Parliament passes an Act; it runs foul of the bureaucrats who do not like it, and it is therefore not proclaimed. One can go on and look at some of the other reasons given why Bills, passed by chambers of this Parliament, have not been proclaimed and one is astounded. By the way, my motion managed to flush out something rather interesting. Somebody suddenly discovered that the International Finance Corporation Act had been passed on 22 November 1963 and the bureaucrats thought that they ought to put it into practice. The Commonwealth Teaching Service Act which was introduced in 1972 was to provide scholarships. Proclamations were delayed `pending drafting of regulations'. Those regulations have not been drafted 16 years on. Somebody has not got round to that exercise. A number of senators will remember the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Amendment Act 1985 being pushed through here at the end of the session. </PARA>
<PARA> My worry is that the device of leaving legislation unproclaimed is used in a number of ways. There are examples of Bills in this paper that the Government said were urgent when they were passed. Indeed, the Government said that one Bill, which is in this paper, was so urgent that it could not accept an amendment. The reason given as to why it was not proclaimed was the very reason that was given in the amendment to fix up the Bill. It is an extraordinary exercise and one that all honourable senators ought to take some note of. If we are willing simply to hand over the legislative power of these chambers to bureaucrats, then it is on our heads. I hope that all political parties in this place will look at what is occurring with the drafting of legislation and whether we might look at inserting a date that it could be proclaimed on rather than simply a date being proclaimed. The Government might not rush Bills in here which are poorly drafted and poorly thought through. </PARA>
<PARA> When one goes through the reasons in this tabled paper one finds, time and again, items that one would have thought would have come up in the drafting of those pieces of legislation. One would have thought that reasons given as to why the Bill cannot be implemented would have been thought of before it was brought in. I am not objecting to the fact that there may be unforeseen occurrences from time to time, but surely we should not have 57 unproclaimed Acts passed by this Parliament sitting on the books. Indeed, that is about half the Acts that we manage to get passed in the year. We could have saved ourselves a lot of time and the country a lot of expense. If we have a legislative backlog, as we do at the moment, it is fair to ask: how many of those Bills currently on the red sheet-we have 38 items listed at the moment-will not be proclaimed? If they are not to be proclaimed, let us take them off the red and save ourselves some time. If they will be proclaimed, it is all right to spend our time looking through them, trying to amend them, passing them or rejecting them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather upset at being gazumped quite so often by the bureaucrats in this exercise. They are deciding who should have the final say in respect of the legislation passed by the representatives of the people in these chambers, presumably in a democracy, who should have the final say. The people who really get the final say at the end of this exercise are the bureaucrats. They say whether they like the legislation. If they do not happen to like it-as was the case with the Act I mentioned on the first page of the tabled statement-they simply make a fuss and do not proclaim it. I do not think it is right; it is not proper. It may very well be that our party room should consider the way in which legislation is drafted. If we are not willing to do that, I hope that honourable senators will support a continuation of my motion. As a result of this material, I now seek to institute a permanent motion so that at least once a session we find out how many pieces of legislation passed are still sitting around in some bottom drawer somewhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to make some comments on this report. I indicate to Senator Macklin that I am sure there will be a great deal of interest from the Opposition parties to ensure that it becomes a standard practice, by way of a permanent order of this chamber, to have regular reports on legislation which has been passed by the Parliament but which has not been proclaimed. I want to draw attention to a couple of matters. This is another step in the reassertion to some degree of a better balance between the legislative and executive branches of government in terms of, if not making the Executive more accountable, at least making the activities of the Executive more open to the scrutiny of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall speaking on this matter some time ago when dealing with a report presented in 1986 by Estimates Committee D which referred to our concerns about lengthy delays between the passage of legislation and its proclamation. I think at that stage I drew attention to an article which had been printed in the Economist in December 1981 which had raised the scandalous record established in the House of Commons of a piece of legislation which had been passed by the Parliament but which 12 years later had not been proclaimed. When I look at this list which comes before us I find two absolutely extraordinary items. The Naval Properties Transfer Act passed in 1925 still has not been proclaimed. Sections 3 and 4 of the Taxation of Loans Act passed in 1923 have not yet been proclaimed. The record established by the House of Commons of a mere 12 years between the enactment of legislation and its proclamation which led to such outrage pales into insignificance in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I do however draw attention to a couple of points in terms of specific examples. There are lengthy sections, for instance, of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1985, the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1987, the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987 and certain customs legislation dealing with security and searches relevant to the detection of drug smuggling, which have not been proclaimed. For instance, those amendments to the Customs Act were made in 1979. Undoubtedly, we were told at the time that the power to detain and search persons who were reasonably suspected of having prohibitive imports internally concealed in their bodies was a matter of urgency. In fact, those sections of the Act dealing with the attempt to crack down on the drug trade have still not been proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I look at the Prime Minister and Cabinet area. The Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Act 1980 has large sections of some importance which have not been proclaimed. I go back to the example that Senator Macklin raised. When this resolution was adopted we asked for a statement of why it was that Acts had not been brought into effect. Under the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981, this explanation occurs:</PARA>
<PARA>These sections-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the unproclaimed sections-</PARA>
<PARA>relate to preferential buying of Australian goods by Commonwealth authorities and provoked considerable and continued Ministerial and bureaucratic opposition on enactment. They were therefore not proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the most extraordinary statement for any parliament to be confronted with. The Parliament passed legislation in terms of preferential buying of Australian goods. Ministers and bureaucrats decided that they did not like the Act of Parliament, and so simply did not proclaim it. What is the purpose of passing legislation through Parliament if Ministers and bureaucrats then decide, `We don't like what the Parliament has done. Therefore, we will simply not proclaim the Act. We will not advise the Governor-General, through the Executive Council, to bring the Act into force'? Nothing could be more subversive of the proper role of Parliament than to say that Parliament can pass legislation which will come into effect if the bureaucracy thinks it ought to come into effect. The opportunity to expose this sort of nonsense is one of which we should be very conscious. </PARA>
<PARA> The distinguished now Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Miss Anne Lynch, published in the House Magazine on 13 May 1987 an article entitled `Proclamation of Acts-When . . . How . . . If?'. That article sets out in detail the history of the Senate's concern about this matter, going back to the days when our former colleague Senator Peter Rae was involved in raising these matters in the Senate. I seek leave to have the Deputy Clerk's article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA>Anne Lynch</PARA>
<PARA>Clerk-Assistant (Committees)</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which was established in 1981, already has an honourable record of considering provisions of Bills which might otherwise escape attention, under civil liberties criteria. Among the five criteria is a provision by which the Committee evaluates proposed legislation to ensure that it does not inappropriately delegate legislative authority. In recent times increased recourse to that provision has been made by the Committee to draw attention to provisions such as clauses which enable Parliamentary enactments to be repealed by executive authority only, without further reference to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems timely, therefore, to draw attention to an increasing trend in the legislative process which also has the effect of delegating to the executive powers formerly exercised by the Parliament. These powers, of a general nature, are laid down in the Acts Interpretation Act, section 5 of which provides that Acts passed by the Parliament will, unless otherwise specified, come into operation 28 days after receiving the Royal Assent. Increasingly, over the last decade or so, the Parliament has ``otherwise provided'' by what seems to be a harmless-looking clause 2 in most Bills, which is headed ``commencement''. In passing, it is no wonder that, in order to get to the heart of policy espoused in a Bill, legislators have ignored the gobbledegook in which this clause is often couched, for example:</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA>2. (1) Subject to sub-section (2), this Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Sections 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37 shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation, being a day later than the day fixed under sub-section (1). </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthy of comment that this example is one of the less complex on offer!</PARA>
<PARA> Stripping the clause of its complexity, the heart lies in the words ``this Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation''. The effect of the seemingly innocuous words can be quite overwhelming. What in fact a Parliament which passes that clause of a bill is doing is saying to the executive, ``we have done our part in giving you all sorts of powers; you can get round to implementing the policies contained at your convenience, with no further input from us as legislators''. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, this may seem perfectly reasonable. However, its consequences are many:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it places in the hands of the bureaucracy an enormous power to gainsay or even override the wishes of the people as expressed by their parliamentary representatives;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if legislation is passed without a time limit set on its implementation, it provides encouragement-because there is no pressure to have structures and administrative details in place by a defined date-to the bureaucracy to be tardy in implementing worthwhile goals;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it can be a method of window dressing, so that the executive can declare an Act of Parliament has been passed in order to help a disadvantaged group within a community-without ever having to mention that there is no intention to implement the proposals contained therein because of, for example, a lack of money;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) it can also be used as an instrument of blackmail-for example, ``we will pass this legislation, but will not bring it into effect unless you, the citizen, behave in a particular way which we do not like''; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) finally, and in my view most significantly, the failure to proclaim a law-whether in whole or, as now more frequently and insidiously occurs, in part-leaves those with a need to be concerned about what the law is in a state of constant indecision and doubt. It is, one might have thought, reasonable to expect that the law is known to operate as a result of its passage through all three constituent parts of the Parliament, that is, by passage of a bill through the House of Representatives and the Senate and Assent by the Governor-General. This-together with a known date of operation-alone gives certainty to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for the use of the proclamation as an alternative to 28 days after Royal Assent, a specified date declared in the legislation, or, in the case of taxation laws in particular, Royal Assent itself was in its early usage perfectly reasonable. It was regarded as a departure from the norm and was used only when, for example, complex regulations could not be finally prepared until the authorising legislation was agreed to by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, however, it is rare for the normal provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act to apply. To illustrate, of the first 12 Acts passed by the Parliament in 1987, 8 contained a provision declaring that the Act or parts thereof should come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. Even more disturbingly, the legislative process has reached such a pass that the ``normal'' operations of the Acts Interpretation Act are even specified in legislation. The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1986 contains the following astonishing provision:</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA> 2. (1) Section 8 and Part V shall be deemed to have come into operation on 24 June 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The remaining provisions of this Act shall come into operation on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The somewhat disturbing trend towards the increased use of proclamations was first noted, both in Australia and Britain, in the early 1980's. For example, The Economist of 12 December 1981 contained a trenchant article drawing attention to the abuse of proclamations at Westminster while, within the Australian Parliament, negotiations were undertaken with the then Government formally to inform the Parliament of executive proclamations. Early in 1982, the following somewhat picturesque Notice of Motion was given by then Senator Peter Rae:</PARA>
<PARA>``Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA>I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move-That an Address be presented by the Senate to His Excellency the Governor-General, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY-</PARA>
<PARA> We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to present the following address:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) noting the Constitutional responsibilities of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives in relation to the passage of all proposed laws of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) noting that each constituent part of the Parliament of the Commonwealth advises the others of agreement, amendment, and assent, as the case may be, to all such proposed laws; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) noting that substantial numbers of laws which pass both Houses of the Parliament and receive the Royal Assent provide that such laws or provisions thereof shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation,</PARA>
<PARA>requests your Excellency to notify each House of the Parliament of each Proclamation which is made to specify a day on which an Act of the Parliament or any provision thereof shall come into operation''. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Notice was to make the point, in what the Senator regarded as a constitutionally proper way, that the Governor-General-as, in effect, the legislature's ``delegate''-might deem it appropriate to advise the Parliament of the completion of the legislative process. Although the Notice of Motion was never formally moved, it unquestionably provided both the focus of and the impetus for this important issue, and subsequently arrangements were made for all proclamations of this nature to be tabled in each House of the Parliament. This practice is now well established. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the question now arises as to whether the Government, with the responsibility for implementing and administering laws passed by Parliament, should give an account of its stewardship in relation to Acts of the Parliament, or sections thereof, which have not been proclaimed. This question arose in stark form during the consideration of estimates of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment during the Budget Sittings of 1986. The Committee reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>``Proclamation of Acts</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned to learn of the lengthy delays that have occurred in proclaiming the Public Lending Rights Act 1985 and the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986, neither of which has yet been proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee appreciates that there can sometimes be a number of legitimate reasons for not proclaiming or delaying the proclamation of legislation. The Department explained to the Committee that the delays in these cases result from the Department having to prepare a gazette notice for the Minister to spell out the operation of the Public Lending Rights scheme and to develop a national cultural heritage control list. The Committee does not regard these explanations as satisfactory for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) There has been a considerable period of time since the Bills were introduced into Parliament. The Committee expects that if Regulations or any other actions need to be prepared consequent upon the passage of the Bills, such preparation would have commenced following their introduction or indeed in conjunction with the original drafting. The legislative history of each Bill was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Public Lending Rights Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA> House of Representatives: Introduced-17 April 1985, Passed-9 May 1985</PARA>
<PARA> Senate: Introduced-9 May 1985, Passed-6 December 1985</PARA>
<PARA> Royal Assent: 16 December 1985</PARA>
<PARA>Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA> House of Representatives: Introduced-27 November 1985, Passed-18 February 1986</PARA>
<PARA> Senate: Introduced-11 March 1985, Passed-1 May 1986</PARA>
<PARA> Royal Assent: 13 May 1986</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act, the Department indicated that it hoped the legislation will be proclaimed towards the end of 1987-two years after its introduction in Parliament!</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The effectiveness of the Senate's capacity to review the Public Lending Rights Bill was reduced due to the Bill being pushed through the Senate's Committee of the Whole stage on the last sitting day in 1985, with the Government claiming its passage was urgently required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that there are a considerable number of Acts and sections of Acts awaiting proclamation. The Committee regards this situation as complete derogation of responsibility by departments and Ministers in allowing such a volume of legislation to remain inoperative. The Committee will be closely monitoring legislation with similar commencement provisions which are the responsibility of departments within the Committee's purview''. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Appropriation Bills were being considered in the Senate on 17 November 1986, Senator Puplick expanded upon the points made in Report. In illustrating his point, he gave quite horrifying examples of outstanding proclamations-some dating back as far as six years-and, reflecting the comments of Estimates Committee D, made the particularly pertinent point that, in relation to one of the Acts on which the Committee had commented-the Public Lending Rights Act 1985-``we were told when the Bill was debated in this chamber that the amendments the Opposition sought to make to the legislation could not be made, that the Bill was an urgent Bill which could not be amended by the Senate in December 1985 because the House of Representatives had adjourned for the year and the Government was not prepared to recall it to deal with amendments which the Senate might have been persuaded to make''. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Puplick made his remarks he commented that the Bill had still not been proclaimed; that remains the situation to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that people are affected as much, if not more, by unconscious acts as by deliberate attempts to take away rights and liberties. For this reason, the question of executive, rather than parliamentary, control of legislative enactment should not be treated as one of those esoteric topics which are a parliamentary officer's equivalent to counting angels dancing on the head of a pin-a source of intellectual merriment and pedantry. One can but hope that the inroads already made by the Senate into executive usurpation of democratic decision-making will continue, so that in future such matters will indeed by merely of intellectual interest, rather than being examined for their perhaps sinister implications. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Some of the pieces of legislation involved are of very considerable significance. Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 will undoubtedly be familiar to colleagues such as Senator Messner and Senator Michael Baume, who are present for this debate. They will know how significant that piece of legislation could be, if it were proclaimed and acted upon. Senator Crichton-Browne has already drawn Senator Macklin's attention to the provisions of the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981. Consistent with his view on this matter, Senator Macklin undoubtedly will be most anxious that section 3 of that Act should be proclaimed. He will accept that the Parliament passed the legislation, and that therefore there is no good and proper reason why, seven or eight years after the event, we should not proceed to the proclamation of section 3 and allow the mining which will be able to take place as a result in fact to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not simply a problem that arises on one side of the Parliament; it has been current before the Senate for some time. My Liberal colleague, former Senator Peter Rae, moved motions on this matter dating back to 1983. Senate Estimates Committee D, of which I was a member, in its report of October 1986, drew attention to a number of Acts within the purview of that Estimates Committee which had not been given effect to by proclamation. This is a very important exercise. It is part of the ongoing role that the Senate should play in the supervision of the activities of the Executive Government. I am pleased that the Senate now has this report. I hope that it will be the first report of many which will help to keep any government on its toes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without canvassing what has been said by Senator Macklin and Senator Puplick, I wish to make the point that they have detailed to the Senate the facts of the issue. I have in the Senate on many occasions expressed my views about the functions of members of parliament: they have a legislative function, an audit control function, representative functions, and so on. By dint of refusing to proclaim legislation simply because it does not agree with other legislation, Ministers and bureaucrats undermine the legislative functions of members of parliament. That indeed is a very serious issue and I am pleased that it has resulted in the tabling of a paper from the Deputy Clerk. I am sure that the Presiding Officers, particularly the President of the Senate, are most interested in this aspect because, as was said by Senator Puplick and Senator Macklin, this is a matter particularly for the Senate to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with what has been said in this debate. I shall not let this matter die. It is not only a question of considering what legislation is now before us which is not urgent. Senator Macklin gave a good example of a piece of legislation which the Government said was so urgent that it could not bear an amendment to it. That piece of legislation has not been proclaimed. We need to examine not only how many pieces of legislation that come before us are urgent, but how many pieces of legislation that come before us are necessary in the first place. If they are not to be proclaimed, obviously they were not necessary. That issue must also be considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the views which have been put by others in this debate, and I wish to place particular emphasis on the matter that was touched upon by Senator Puplick in respect to the provisions relating to Koongarra. That project is capable of providing, as Senator Collins will know better than anybody else, $256m in revenue for the Aboriginal community involved-enormous wealth for the Australian people. Furthermore, it will make a significant contribution to our balance of payments at a time when it is at crisis point. Yet the matter has been deferred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a matter of general principle I support the arguments which have been put. To do otherwise is to ignore the fundamentals of the functioning of Parliament and the administration of the laws of Australia. Whenever we have before us cases such as were articulated by Senator Macklin and Senator Puplick, they touch on the trust in government and in the procedures involved in the passage of legislation in our parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> A further extension of that, which exacerbates the problem, is the present practice by this Government-although I have to admit that the last coalition Government was not without sin-of introducing notice of legislation in a general sense and in an inarticulate sense by fiat. To all intents and purposes, legislation takes effect from the day that it is announced, as we find this Treasurer (Mr Keating) doing. Frankly, that makes the passage of the legislation inconsequential and the proclamation totally irrelevant. The Treasurer now takes the cradle of democracy into his arms and acts as though there is no Parliament. As was the case recently with legislation that was almost four years old, when the Treasurer finally puts the legislation through Parliament its date of operation is made retrospective to the date that the Treasurer released his press statement-press statements which, by definition, can only be vague, imprecise, and on many occasions inaccurate, and certainly uninformative. So, at the end of the day, the poor little citizen who elects senators and members for the purposes of forming a government is kept totally in the dark as to the effect of the legislation, and in many respects the functioning of Parliament becomes totally irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw this recently with the legislation in respect of taxation, concerning taxation on benefits accruing by way of trips, and rewards of that nature. The High Court of Australia held that if such benefits were not paid in cash they were not taxable. As I said at the time, I assume that the people involved had been taking the benefit assuming it to be tax free and accommodating their standard of living accordingly, only to find four years later that new and different levels of taxation applied. This occurs simply because the fundamental premise, the fundamental process of government in this Parliament, is first of all ignored and then deliberately bypassed by the Treasurer, with the approval of Cabinet and the support of the Government members in this chamber and in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> While we debate here the matter of the date of proclamation, we ought to remind ourselves that the date of introduction of legislation into Parliament in the first place is relevant. That is the first opportunity that a citizen has to examine what his rights and responsibilities are and, ultimately, what his obligations are. Up to that point a citizen simply has a one-page press statement telling him that his whole tax obligation has changed. That is extended further, as we are not told, by the failure of the administration by governments, through bureaucrats, to proclaim legislation when it is ultimately passed by both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, that is showing an absolute contempt for the process of decision making and for those who support the legislation in whatever its ultimate form. I hope that, this matter having been raised, the Government will reconsider its position in terms of expediting this matter. However, I despair that the Government will ever take notice of the detrimental effects that government by fiat has upon the people of Australia. However, I suspect that this is a matter upon which it will be judged ultimately at the next election. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

I recommend to senators who have had questions on notice for more than 30 days that they seek to take advantage of this provision. I wish to read into the record a response I have had from the President of the Senate which clarifies the standing of some of those questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Senator Macklin. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 9 November 1988 relating to the resolution of the Senate of 28 September 1988, on your motion, concerning questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution could not be regarded as having any retrospective effect in the absence of any express provision for retrospectivity, so it did not take effect at once in respect of questions on the notice paper on that day. It does apply, however, to all questions which are on the notice paper 30 days or more after 28 September, regardless of whether notice of them was given before or after that date. I think that this is the correct interpretation of the resolution. The notice paper now shows which questions have remained unanswered for 30 days or more since 28 September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I urge honourable senators to take advantage of the resolution of the Senate to get answers to their questions. I believe that if they do so we will make questions on notice a useful questioning function of the Executive rather than simply a paper exercise that bulges over the year with hundreds of unanswered questions. This is an opportunity for senators to question the Executive and have the answers promptly delivered to them. I believe that in very large measure the non-answering of questions on notice to date, probably due to delays within the departments concerned has amounted almost to a contempt of this chamber. I hope that, by more strenuous use of the resolution which is now on the books, we will be able to get prompt and ready answers to reasonable questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not expecting the Executive to want to answer, or to be able to answer, every question put to it. Indeed, I believe that on occasions many questions have been put on the Notice Paper which, if answered, would have caused massive expenditure of public moneys in order to get the information together-to little or no effect. I believe that those questions which are responsible questions, particularly those questions about matters on which one would expect current information to be held, ought to be answered-and answered promptly. I urge all honourable senators to use the facility that we have voted for ourselves so that we can get some better accountability from the Executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to paper No. 7, the Australian Wool Corporation annual report for 1987-88. I have spoken to this report previously, but would like to add a few remarks. I believe that, as 1988 is the bicentennial year and in view of the historic significance of wool to Australia, it is appropriate for the wool industry to play a major role in celebrating 200 years of Australia's nationhood. I think we can all remember very well indeed the bicentennial wool collection staged in the Sydney Opera House on 31 January. It brought together woolgrowers and leaders of the world's textile, retail and fashion industries. It certainly demonstrated how highly the wool industry is regarded both within Australia and internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the woolgrowers themselves have wanted to ensure the future of the industry. They have decided to increase the funds available for international wool promotion. I was very interested to read in the People magazine an article about Bill Peach and a new image for wool that he was promoting. I think that we all know of Bill Peach through his tourism activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, I think the article was about people and was in the New Idea magazine. I would not like Senator Collins to think that perhaps I had gone in for reading other magazines. However, this was a very interesting article about Bill Peach. We are used to seeing Bill Peach and his documentaries about Australia. They have all been very interesting. This time, the documentary has been partly sponsored by the Australian Wool Corporation and will take 3 1/2 weeks to make. It is entitled Golden Fleece. Its purpose is to inform and entertain Australians about the uses of wool overseas. I think that that documentary will certainly be worth looking at. Apparently, Bill Peach is going to Russia. He said in the article that in Russia wool was creating a minor fashion revolution and that he would be very interested to see how the Russian woman in the street was using wool to make Russian fashion even better. I was very pleased to read about that documentary. It is to be filmed in Tokyo, Shanghai, Milan, Leningrad, Moscow, rural England and London, and will be a documentary worth seeing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last time I spoke about the Australian Wool Corporation report I mentioned the `Mr Cool in Wool' campaign. I read just recently that the Australian Wool Corporation, in its recent awards for inventors, gave top marks to the scientific achievements of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The Sir Ian McLennon award was given to Dr Dieter Plate, Assistant Chief of the Division of Wool Technology and the man responsible for Sirospun, the revolutionary Australian process that gave the world `cool wool'. I think we all know that cool wool is an extra lightweight fabric that is light enough to be worn in summer and warm enough to wear through autumn chills. Actually, Dr Plate himself believes that Sirospun could enable Australia to process more of its wool clip at home and to provide more value added dollars to our $6 billion annual wool sales. He maintained that luck had been important in developing Sirospun, but I think that Dr Plate should be commended indeed on the work he has done, because I think it is all of great assistance to the woolgrowers and to the development of the wool industry in general. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report comes from the Australian Archives Advisory Council, of which I am a member. I want to refer particularly to the fact that, under section 56 (2) of the Archives Act, as yet no arrangements have been put in place for special requests. I remind the Senate that prior to 1984, when the Archives Act passed through the Parliament, the decision to grant access was an administrative one taken by the Minister responsible for the Archives and the relevant Minister responsible for the agency whose records were being sought. However, that arrangement was superseded by the legislation introduced in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> During the four years that have passed attempts apparently have been made to sort out a set of arrangements between the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Attorney-General and the security and intelligence agencies, but as yet they have not been successful. The Archives Advisory Council has commented on this on a number of occasions, and does so again in the summary of its activities in the 1987-88 report. We have had a succession of Ministers with jurisdiction over the Archives. The Advisory Council sent a delegation to Senator Robert Ray when he was in charge of the Archives. When he left the portfolio, we saw the new Minister, Mr West. I believe it important that some scheme be set up granting special access to the Archives to ensure that there is some scrutiny and monitoring of the Government in its willingness or otherwise to make available the documents and records held by its agencies. It is almost as though the Act is being used to stifle access to information, rather than the reverse. We would be better off with the arrangement we had previously-an arrangement between the Minister responsible for the Archives and the agency in question. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wanted to refer to was the production of a book by the Australian Archives this year to mark the Bicentenary. The book is entitled Relations in Records: A guide to family history sources in the Australian Archives, and was very well received. It was launched by Senator Robert Ray on behalf of the Australian Archives. For anybody commencing genealogy as a hobby, it is a very valuable document and, I think, something very worth while for the Archives to have produced during the bicentennial year. I ask the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is present and, I know, listening to my remarks, to take this up with the Government to deal with the matter of requests under section 56, part II, to which the Council draws attention, not for the first time since the legislation was passed in 1984. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me rather extraordinary that one should have to discuss a so-called blueprint for Australian higher education in this way. Indeed, the Government did not see fit, either in this chamber or in the other place, to allocate a time in which this particularly important debate might be held. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with the central problem of government and education and what role government has to play in education as distinct from the funding exercise. The major problem has been fairly clear. What we are looking at is probably a relatively heavy-handed exercise in terms of this paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy which the Government has set down in the paper and is implementing represents a very narrow utilitarian view of what higher education institutions might be able to contribute by way of economic restructuring. Despite the genuflection-and that is about all it is-to the institutions' cultural role, the Commonwealth, having done that obligatory bit of rhetoric, spends the rest of the paper discussing essentially the economic contributions that higher education might make to Australia. In particular, it looks at items such as the size of institutions. In the Australian Capital Territory and the States we have seen the proposition that the size of an institution can be somehow equated to its worth. Obviously, that is absurd. There are no linkages between size and quality. For example, the proposed amalgamations in my State will try to swallow up the Conservatorium of Music which has 350 students. That college has a worldwide and an Australian reputation second to none, having got four out of the five winners in the most recent awards. The Julliard School of Music in New York has 400 students and the Royal Academy of Music in London has 350. The number of students in the major music schools around the world hovers around that figure, yet in Australia we propose that they have to be part of an institution of 6,000 or 7,000 students. There are no linkages. The Government simply assumes them. </PARA>
<PARA> The unresolved tension that is evident in the White Paper has probably resulted from a lot of talk of reducing centralised control, creating conditions in which institutions can be more innovative and independent, and so on. There is a whole set of statements about institutions having to have priorities in areas defined by government as national priorities and having to undertake management changes and amalgamations according to national priorities. I think that this tension will be resolved. There will be only one resolution; that is, institutions will be able to be flexible in those areas dictated by the Government. It is a simple resolution of the tension, but it is a resolution which will be to the disadvantage of the country and to learning in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the only economic criterion which points ahead as being an area in which one might invest, knowing that investment in that area is linked directly with outcomes, one looks at dollars invested in higher education or, more particularly, dollars invested as part of the gross domestic product contribution to education across the board. That is the only reliable predictor of where we might be going. I believe that this entire policy is misguided and misdirected and that ultimately it will be to the disadvantage of not only the students who are undertaking education but also the country in general. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>We are considering the guidelines issued to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) in relation to the performance of its functions in accordance with section 8 of the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988. That legislation was passed by the Senate half way through this year. The last part of the guidelines at page 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA>NBEET's advice to me should be framed in recognition of the budgetary priorities outlined above, and on the explicit assumption that there will be no further growth in expenditure in the Employment, Education and Training portfolio to cover new policy proposals in future financial years. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government put down in writing over the signature of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 30 September that there will be no future growth in expenditure in this area. I have been saying that for a long time, but seemingly the press did not want to believe it. It is now in writing over the Minister's signature. It means that we face a continuing run-down, because no further expenditure means a wind-back of support for education in this country and a move to financing education by the private sector. It also means, and gives tacit support to, the notion of a myriad of developments in private higher education. It also means that the current level of $800 for each student, as suggested in the Higher Education Funding Bill, which passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday night, will soon be exceeded and could rise to as high as $8,000 within two or three years. That will be the only way-if that is correct-in terms of the guidelines provided to the Board that it can take on board the direction that there will be no further increases in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the advice to the Government from the Board should be done on the basis of what is optimal, not necessarily what is achievable. If it is done on the basis of what is optimal, the Government will make the hard political decisions as to what is achievable within that optimal range. Why bother getting together a group of people who are expert in education, who have the ability to look at that whole range of institutions and advise as to what best might be done and place those constraints upon them? That is essentially an absurd exercise. What we are trying to get out of the Board is advice about where to go. The Government can then pick from that advice those things which are possible within its own financial and budgetary arrangements. But to apply those constraints up-front means that no optimal procedures will be raised, no way ahead will be flagged and no broader vision will be mapped out by which we might be able to have an education debate in this country that is worth having. I do not think that it is much use having a board which simply does the type of job that is currently being done by a department. We had this argument regarding the Schools Commission and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. It looks as though we are about to have the same argument again. It is a senseless and useless proposition and, in the end, a waste of public funds to so constrain such an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this body and the people appointed to it give us a great deal of hope that they can come up with a quite far-sighted and interesting projection of where Australia should be going in the 1990s-if they are allowed to do so. On the basis of saying, `This is the optimum; this is where we could go; these are the types of things we need', we are then able to judge this Government's or any future government's performance in this area. We do not have that benchmark. We are to be deprived specifically of that benchmark by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Hence, I think that the national debate will be that much the poorer, because without that projection I do not see how we are able to estimate whether the Government has done a good or bad job or whether its own priorities for expenditure in this area compared with other areas are something that we would like. I think that is a pity. It destroys the effective work that was done by this chamber in amending that Bill to make a strong, vibrant organisation. Essentially that organisation has now been neutered by the guidelines provided under the legislation by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>We are presented with the final report, volumes 1 and 2, of the Constitutional Commission, which has in excess of 1,100 pages. They are 1,100 pages of pure failed propaganda. It was never the intention of this Government that there be a proper, healthy, open and fruitful debate on constitutional reform from the outset without reflecting on any individual in a personal way. The Government sought to find people to put on the Constitutional Commission who it judged, whatever their political persuasion, would be moved to agree to the essential core proposition which the Government had. Of course, this proposition was for four-year terms for the Senate tied to the House of Representatives and the inevitable and inexorable consequence that the Senate would lose its fundamental powers in respect of its legislative capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> As events unfolded and it became obvious to the Government and the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that their agenda was in tatters, that the public was awake to their intentions, they immediately jettisoned the findings of the Constitutional Commission and introduced and raised their own agenda and gave us four questions of their own. Those four questions, which at the end of the day cost the Australian taxpayers $37m at a time when they had holes in the seat of their pants because of the levels of taxation they were paying, were never going to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of 1,100 pages of report we got proposals for a mini Bill of Rights; a facade, a pretension, of recognition of local government in the Constitution; freedom from religion, and freedom of religion, which we have already got; trial by jury, which we have already got; and reasonable and fair compensation, which we have already got. I suspect that the referendum on these questions was unique. I do not recall another occasion when a question has been put up and has not been carried in one single State. Never before has there been a uniform vote of the type we saw on this occasion. In excess of 70 per cent of the population said no to the Government. Yet it cost us tens of millions of dollars to go through the charade and the exercise. At the end of the day we saw the desperation of people such as Sir Maurice Byers, who got himself involved in the politics of the debate. </PARA>

The tragedy of this farce is that for at least the foreseeable future the Government has undone any prospect we had of constitutional reform. We have a Constitution which the High Court of Australia, in its own selective and subjective way, seeks to interpret and make a live and living document. That does not necessarily reflect community view. While we could have had an open and free bipartisan debate as to where it needs to be changed and amended to accommodate contemporary society, that probably for the next decade has been lost because of the conduct and misbehaviour of the Government, which used and abused the Parliament and the taxpayers' money to put up dodgy and fraudulent questions, which of course failed. It is an indictment upon this Government that it buried any prospect of future rational debate and amendments and variations to the Constitution which are no doubt necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join Senator Crichton-Browne in expressing my concern at not only the nature of the Constitutional Commission Report but also the Government's failure to act with integrity on its recommendations. I wish to deal in particular with one element of it: the suggestion of a four-year term for the Parliament, which I believe this Government successfully demolished by purporting to propose an improvement but surrounding it with impossible qualifications. This worthwhile objective was totally rejected by the Australian people and, in that form, properly so. This has set back many years the prospect of getting an improvement in the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am strongly in favour of a four-year term for the House of Representatives and a much longer term for the Senate. The elections should not be coincidental. However, I note with distress that when the Government produced its recent referendum proposals it did nothing to ensure a longer term for this Parliament. It wanted to remove, by reducing the rights of the Senate, the one inhibition on a Prime Minister shortening the term of a parliament. I only hope that the next government, which will come from members on this side of the House, will be prepared to bite the bullet at an early time and have an honest referendum on a four-year term for the House of Representatives which does not effectively mean a diminishing of the present short term. As the Senate knows, the average length of a term for the House of Representatives in recent years has been something like two years. There appears to be a need-this was discussed by the Constitutional Commission but totally ignored by the Government-to put some limit on the freedom and the power of an executive to determine when it should take the Parliament to the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us today the two final reports of the Constitutional Commission, volumes 1 and 2. The Commission was set up at a cost of $6m. The Commission's own propaganda, entitled Australia's Constitution: Time to Update, said that the Commission would report to the Federal Government and that the Government would then decide what recommendations to put at the referendum. In typical style the Government set up this Commission but did not wait for its report before it brought forward its own four ludicrous questions to put to the people. An interim report was put down and the Government chose to ignore its recommendations. It did not pick up one of its suggestions. In the propaganda booklet Australia's Constitution: Time to Update there is a foreword by Professor Colin Howard, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Few peoples can be so plagued with constitutional problems in their daily lives as are Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The foreword continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A dull, remote and incomprehensible document like a printed constitution seems to have no connection with life as it is actually lived. This appearance is misleading. The constitution has everything to do with life as it is actually lived. </PARA>
<PARA>You bet it has. The Australian people are well aware that the Constitution, as it is written, as it has served them since Federation, has given them a country that is amongst the top 18 countries out of 165 in the world, in terms of political and general freedoms. That Constitution, upheld by the governments that have run this country, has given the people this freedom that is so valuable to us. I repeat that only 18 countries out of 165 have the freedoms that we have in Australia. This whole referendum debacle cost the Australian taxpayer in excess of $37m, yet this Government tells everyone, `Pull your belts in because it is time, unfortunately, for us to save'. The Government has put us so far in debt with our overseas balance of payments that everyone has got to pull in his belt-everyone, that is, except the Government, which could squander not a paltry amount, but $37m of taxpayers' money on a referendum that it wanted to get through cloaked in questions so misleading that the people of Australia said, `There must be something wrong with this', and threw out the four of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been accused of not being in touch with the people of Australia on many occasions. I say that this is the ultimate proof. If ever there was proof of this it was when, more significantly that at any other time in Australia's history, every State threw out every question that the Government attempted to bring in. In defence the Government said, `The Australian people are stupid; they don't understand', but the people of Australia certainly understood. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In making a few remarks on the annual report of the Prices Surveillance Authority, I note that of late the Government has been doing quite a lot navel gazing. It has been trying to find out why it has not been exactly the flavour of the month-one other term that was used was `not travelling well'-and why it has been suffering so badly in Federal by-elections around the country this year. A very good place for it to look would be in the area of price restraint or, rather, the lack of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority, which replaced the Prices Justification Tribunal in 1983, was set up with one aim: to maintain the accord known as the prices and incomes accord. It should perhaps more accurately be named the `profits and incomes accord' because there appears to be very little political will on the part of the Government to address seriously the problem of dramatic price increases and their effect on ordinary Australians. There are several examples of current price control mechanisms failing us badly. One of the most current is the pricing of beer. In the Budget the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced dramatic changes to the sales tax and excise on beer, particularly low alcohol beer. His motives had more to do with fulfilling his consumer price index prediction than they did with helping consumers; but, notwithstanding that, we should have been assured that consumers would see a dramatic drop in beer prices commensurate with the changes that were made in that Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 September I sought an assurance from Senator Walsh that this was occurring. He said in reply that the Prices Surveillance Authority had taken appropriate action. However, retail prices have not dropped universally to the extent that the Budget changes would suggest. So we had a windfall for the liquor industry at the cost of taxpayers, and the price control mechanism in that case has been found to be ineffective. Similarly, almost all major banks-including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, regrettably-have introduced a range of bank charges despite their phenomenal profit increases in a climate where the Government has claimed deregulation of the banking industry was necessary to introduce competition which would be of benefit to all Australian consumers. All we see are increased charges, which impact most on small account holders and therefore low income people and people on benefits who commonly use their bank accounts and who are, if not forced, certainly massively encouraged by the Government to use their bank accounts as the mechanisms through which their benefits are paid if they are Commonwealth beneficiaries. Throughout this whole exercise of increased charges, which has drawn a considerable outcry from the public, the Government has sat on its hands and as far as I am aware-and I am not any further enlightened by this report-the Prices Surveillance Authority has not taken action. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area in which consumers have considerable cause for complaint is petrol prices. The report notes-as, of course, we are aware-that the Authority does not exercise surveillance over retail prices of petrol and there are other areas of action that are necessary there, some of which the Australian Democrats have over time attempted to take. The tremendous fluctuation of petrol prices has a great impact on consumers, particularly in rural areas where there can be no certainty in people's actions in the purchasing of petrol, again an area where the Prices Surveillance Authority is certainly failing ordinary consumers in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is in five volumes and of 2,200 pages. It contains the Inter-State Commission's preliminary findings and proposed strategy for removing waterfront-related impediments to Australia's trade. This is crucial to the country's economic prosperity. There is one overwhelming finding in this very lengthy report, that is, there is an urgent need for fundamental changes to the waterfront industry as it operates at present. That would be the least surprising finding of the year. The Commission found, not surprisingly, that the policy of incremental adjustments to industry arrangements in the past has not succeeded. We do not solve the problems of monopolies by nibbling at the edges. The only way to bring monopolies under control is either by legislation-and then there is the question of who has the power to make the legislation-or by introducing competition. We will never do it by encouragement and inducement, because monopolies are in a strong position. They will not yield to such blandishments. They may bend a little, but we will soon find that they have gone back to where they were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government keeps on calling for reports, such as this one, but it is very slow to take action. I think the time is up. Since 1986 we have had eight official reports on, or inquiries into, the waterfront industry. The time for reports is past. The time for action is now. This report identifies four major causes of our waterfront inefficiencies. The first is overmanning. There are so many examples one could give of grotesque overmanning that I shall not bore the Senate by listing them. The second is restrictive work practices. Again, we all know the sorts of restrictive work practices that operate on the waterfront. The third is hours lost through industrial disputes. At the moment the waterfront industry is the second worst of Australian industries, after the troubled coal industry. The second highest number of days lost was on the waterfront. And they are not all over industrial matters. Last year 84 disputes on the waterfront were in protest at the internal policies of South Africa, leading to substantial ship and cargo delays. The final problem we have is high unit costs; that is, the employment of unnecessary or unfit workers, restrictive work practices and low productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must all understand is that we all pay for these inefficiencies. Inefficiencies with regard to coastal shipping are compounded by the inefficiency of our ports. Our exports are less competitive because of the inefficiencies of our ports. Our imports cost more because of the inefficiency of our ports. This is really a test case of this Government's economic handling. A few years ago Australia had a downturn in the value of its exports. The terms of trade turned against us. If you looked at what we had to do, obviously we had to improve the productivity of our work force. We had to get more investment in capital equipment. We had to reduce or keep down the amount we borrowed overseas during the transition phase. Of course, if you borrow overseas-as this Government has-$100,000m in five and a bit years, you have to pay interest on that, and that makes recovery more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> On all those matters-the productivity of the work force, investment in plant and equipment, holding down our overseas borrowings in the transition phase-this Government has not tackled any of the problems successfully. If we want to succeed as an economic country, if we want the standard of living of all Australians to rise, these are the problems we must tackle, and these are the problems the Government is failing to tackle. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper in fact is a bundle of 22 treaties and I have them in my hand. It is the current practice of the Government that about twice a year a similar bundle of treaties is lobbed into the Senate, with little opportunity for effective scrutiny. In 1986 there were 30 new treaties, in 1987 there were 42, and so far this year there have been 44. I have 3 1/2 minutes to get through 22 treaties. It is very interesting that some of these treaties are conventions, which could oblige Australia to undertake certain tasks. In so doing the Government could utilise the external affairs power and ride roughshod over the rights of the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice among the treaties that are before us today there is a Protocol of 1984 to amend the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, for example. The instrument of accession was deposited by Australia on 22 June 1988. The Protocol is not yet in force. There is a United Nations Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods, an instrument of accession deposited by Australia on 17 March 1988. Entry into force for Australia is 1 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> If a true opportunity were given by the Senate to discuss these matters, then that would not be so bad, but I doubt that there is anyone in the Government who could state with any degree of accuracy the actual number of international treaties to which Australia is a signatory and which are still current. My research reveals that since Federation Australia has signed 2,035 international treaties. Obviously some of these have expired, but most of these documents await discovery by a clever lawyer or an unscrupulous government to be employed as vehicles to underpin new Federal laws and actions which are designed to override the powers of the States. I do not want to anticipate debate on a notice of motion that I have before the chamber. Suffice to say that these considerations should be borne in mind when honourable senators from both sides of the chamber consider the letters that I have written to them about my notice of motion, which in effect would establish a Senate standing committee to study the implications for the legislative powers of the States of treaties proposed to be entered into-and those that have already been entered into-by the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>

The report indicates quite clearly that the Gallery has been very successful indeed with the exhibitions it has held. The significance of that, other than artistically, is what it has done for Canberra in attracting tourists. I was present at the Australian Capital Territory tourism awards night at which the Gallery had conspicuous success. In fact, it won the most popular tourist attraction award, the special event award for the `Old Masters: New Visions' exhibition, the award for tourism marketing of the ACT; and James Mollison received an award for the most outstanding contribution to tourism in the ACT. I think the Senate should note not only that the Gallery has been successful in winning these awards, but also that the people of Canberra appreciate what has been done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report also refers, on page 14, to late night openings and the fact that they have been resoundingly popular. I believe that some of Canberra's tourist facilities should be open later than is the case at present, because the hours between 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. are not particularly helpful to the industry. I hope that, in time, the Gallery can be opened on perhaps four nights a week and that it becomes very much a part of the evening program for the ACT. At least it does open one night a week at present and on other special occasions. I offer my congratulations to James Mollison and the Gallery on their contribution to tourism in Canberra, and I express the hope that it continues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not yet in any position to express a view formally on behalf of the Opposition about this particular matter, but simply draw attention to the fact that there are a large number of significant and as yet unanswered questions about the operation of the proposed Antarctic mineral resources regime. I understand that the Government has now put this matter forward for public comment and that it is not going to make a final decision on the matter until it has had the benefit of studying public comments on the treaty and on the related proposed minerals regime. We have already seen from within the Government some public expression of a degree of concern about this matter. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 November indicated the view, attributed to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who had written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on this matter, that signature of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities could involve some concession of our economic claims over the Antarctic, for virtually no reward to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a particular interest in the regime in the Antarctic because in 1980 I was a member of the Australian delegation which participated in the negotiation of the regime which led to the signing of the convention for the conservation of marine living natural resources. In fact, together with Mr Jacobi, the then member for Hawker, I was one of the two members of the Australian Parliament who actually signed that treaty, together with Ambassador Brennan. As a result, I have followed very closely the development of the minerals convention over many years under the chairmanship of Mr Beeby from New Zealand and have paid a great deal of attention to the working papers that have come out of the various international conferences, culminating in the final conference of treaty parties in Wellington in May. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also draw attention to the fact that my colleague the member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, has recently published a lengthy document dealing with the Antarctic minerals regime and has put forward within the Opposition parties a detailed paper on this regime in which he expressed his own views about the convention. I have no doubt that Mr Smith's paper will provide the Opposition with a great deal of material to discuss as it formulates its view about whether Australia should enter into full participation under this treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very brief time that is available, I do not have the opportunity to canvass what I think are the many deficiencies in the text of the Final Report and the Final Act of the Fourth Special Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting on Antarctic Mineral Resources or those in the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. Nor will I have time to comment on the press statement on this matter issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 22 November. I simply say that it should not be assumed at this stage that the Opposition is entirely satisfied with the text and indeed with the assurances which have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful for the fact that the Government has made it clear that, in tabling this convention, its aim is to promote community discussion. I hope that that will be genuine community discussion and that the views of people who might have some concern about this matter will be capable of being taken into consideration before the Government makes a final decision on it. It is of enormous significance, although I think very few people in Australia would appreciate that. It proposes a quantum change in the nature of activities to take place on the Antarctic continent which, if not properly controlled and properly regulated, may have the most devastating consequences for all of us. There is a threshold question of whether any such activity should be permitted and, if it is permitted, under what terms and conditions. I look forward to participating in the public and community discussion which should take place on this very important subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak to the Final Report and the Final Act of the Fourth Special Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting on Antarctic Mineral Resources. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said, these documents are the result of six years of negotiations by the Antarctic treaty consultative parties, which were done to develop a regime to govern any commercial mineral activity which might be proposed in Antarctica in the future. Since 1977 a policy of voluntary restraint has applied in respect of commercial exploration for and exploitation of minerals in the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1981 the Antarctic treaty consultative parties began negotiating a convention for the regulation of mineral activity, and the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities is the result. Conservation groups, of course, were not party to the negotiations. The document sets out a legal framework for the conduct of prospecting and exploration for and exploitation of minerals in the Antarctic. It will, if accepted, replace the moratorium on mining and, if ratified, will facilitate the exploitation of mineral deposits in the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated that the aim of the convention was to establish a structure for dealing with future mineral discoveries and not to encourage present mineral activities, there is considerable room for doubt, given the strength of those treaty nations which are strongly pro-mining. In fact, I believe that this convention could be the thin end of the wedge for the destruction of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> The preamble to the convention makes reference to the concern of the Antarctic treaty states to protect the Antarctic environment, its scientific value and its wilderness qualities. Again, there is cause for concern in this respect; exploration activity will certainly cause damage to the environment. The continent's fragile and unique wilderness will suffer irreversible damage if wide-scale mining takes place. The convention does not, in its present form, contain specific and detailed provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Furthermore, the liability provisions are imprecise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable senators that the Antarctic is much more than an el dorado of mineral deposits; it is the world's last great continental wilderness, the coldest and driest place on earth, covering 10 per cent of the world's surface. Ninety-eight per cent of the continent is covered by an icecap two kilometres thick. The Antarctic and the surrounding Southern Ocean comprise a unique and fragile environment supporting marine and bird life as well as Antarctic vegetation about which very little is still known. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my remarks, albeit very briefly, on the private member's Bill that Senator Sheil has introduced into the Senate-the Census and Statistics Amendment (Voluntary Provision of Survey Information) Bill 1988. It provides that survey information be provided voluntarily rather than compulsorily. Senator Sheil was concerned enough to introduce this Bill because of the shonky, intrusive and absolutely outrageous Australian Bureau of Statistics survey that was foisted upon the people of Australia this year. I just hope that if this Bill is passed here and, by some quirk of fate, passed in the other place, it is, unlike many of the other Bills mentioned earlier today by Senators Macklin and Puplick, proclaimed. As I said before, this intrusive survey was foisted upon the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a most burdensome and highly intrusive survey. They are not my words; they are the words of the Assistant Statistician in a minute paper he sent to the Deputy Statistician. I repeat that he said this is a most burdensome and highly intrusive survey that has caused all sorts of concerns particularly to old people around the country. Before the matter was adjourned, I was speaking about the numbers of people who had contacted my office and had gone to the offices of honourable senators complaining about the complicated and highly intrusive nature of this survey. It is clear that the due processes of Parliament are being ignored by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. There are those who argue that the material which the survey provides is vital to the nation. I cannot, for the life of me, see why families should be required, without any choice, to reveal details of their house mortgages, Bankcard loans, or how much they spend at a supermarket, to any individual or bureaucracy. It is virtually impossible to guarantee that the information provided remains private. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Australian Democrats have shared this concern in respect of the identification card. The people of Australia showed the Government what they thought of the ID card because they did not trust the Government to guarantee confidentiality. We had the same concern with the pharmaceutical benefits changes. A major concern on that related to information given by pharmacists and doctors to bureaucrats. I am not at all against procuring statistics for proper purposes. As a farmer I know the value of stock and crop returns. I have filled them out all my life in business. I know that every farmer around Australia fills these out in good faith. It is compulsory to do so. I suppose the reason that it is compulsory in this case is that farmers are known to be a bit lazy on paperwork and such matters. But the questions asked of farmers are not intrusive; they are purely fact finding questions that I do not believe they object to. The data taken from these is used effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia have had this particular compulsory household survey thrust upon them. It requires them to give details that they do not want to give. How do we know that the people who are required to do this against their will will give the correct answers? I know that I would not give details that I did not want to give. The Bureau of Statistics is likely to receive information that it does not require. Therefore, the survey falls over. It is far better to conduct a survey with the cooperation of the people. Senator Sheil is to be congratulated on bringing in a Bill that will make details provided in surveys voluntary rather than compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that many people in our community would provide this information on a voluntary basis if they thought it was in the interests of bettering our system. I am sure there are many public-minded people who would give this information voluntarily rather than being bludgeoned into doing so by a very intrusive survey. It is imperative that any future surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics be voluntary regardless of the possible effect that may have on the survey. The people have the right to choose whether they wish to reveal their personal details. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not understand the relevance of that interjection. The particular quote from John Howard's second reading speech on the necessary balance to be struck between the essential collection of accurate data for all government of whatever political persuasion and personal privacy is as relevant today as it was in 1981. The relevance of his statement is that a major overhaul was conducted of the entire Bureau of Statistics leading up to that legislation in 1981-it was not a minor Bill. When that Bill was introduced in 1981 by John Howard, who was then responsible for the operations of the ABS, he provided the powers and penalties which this Bill now seeks to strike down. I think that it is a foolish proposal. It is also based on utter and complete nonsense. I refer to a press release issued by Senator Sheil on 30 May 1988 wherein he laid down the reason and justification for this legislation. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Sheil drew up the Bill following suggestions that 14,000 Australian families were to be selected for a random health survey that would inquire into their sex lives, even to the extent of asking if and when they used condoms. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement, like so many issued by Senator Sheil, is utter and complete nonsense-it was then and it is now. What is irresponsible and contemptible about the statement by Senator Sheil is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics had categorically refuted this nonsense prior to Senator Sheil issuing this press release and subsequent press releases, and that factual information was completely ignored by Senator Sheil. The basis on which he launched this was about as good as the basis on which he condemned the Department of Administrative Services for failing to pay his staff. </PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant to consider how the Australian Bureau of Statistics works because of the profound ignorance Senator Sheil has shown in this matter as a result of some of the other statements he has made. The same press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`The situation is right out of hand', said Senator Sheil. `We have groups of outside bodies riding their own hobby-horses and using the power of the ABS to require compulsory answers to their questions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolute nonsense, as I will demonstrate in a moment. Senator Sheil went on in a further press release dated 2 June 1988 to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Bureau of Statistics is being `used' by unions and self-interest groups . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is nonsense. It might be of benefit to members of the Senate to understand how the ABS operates. It does not have the untrammelled powers suggested by Senator Sheil. It is not the subject of outside interest groups and hobbyhorses. It acts in a very precise way which is regulated by this Parliament. In respect of the operations of the ABS, the statistical collection of data is carried out under specific legislative authority. It is not the open-ended and free rein exercise of untrammelled power that Senator Sheil suggests. The Census and Statistics Act 1905 provides in part that the Statistician:</PARA>
<PARA>may from time to time collect such statistical information in relation to the matters prescribed for the purposes of this Section as he or she considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Prescribed matters are listed in statistics regulations that are subject to the disallowance of this House. Amongst other matters, they include population and the social, economic and demographic characteristics of the population; health, health services and quarantine; social and welfare services; housing; and income, expenditure and savings in relation to a person, household or family. In addition, subsection 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 provides that each new proposal for the collection of information has to be laid before both Houses of Parliament before its implementation-which is also subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further control that is exercised on the way in which the ABS conducts its business. Obviously this has completely escaped the attention of Senator Sheil in all the years he has served in the Senate. The ABS does not rely on people riding hobbyhorses or on private interest groups. It relies on the Australian Statistics Advisory Council. That Council, which consists of representatives of all States and the Northern Territory, community organisations and businesses, advises the ABS on exactly what information it shall collect. The advice it offers to the ABS is tabled in this Parliament every year. I understand that those reports have been tabled in this Parliament every year since 1977. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I challenge you, as you will have the opportunity to do, to rise in this debate, instead of continually interjecting, and cite to me the section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act which gives the powers to the ABS which the senator who introduced this legislation said it has. I say again categorically, despite the continued ignorance displayed by Senator Knowles and Senator Sheil, that the ABS has no power to forcibly enter premises or to seize documents, and has never had those powers. It does Senator Sheil no credit to continue to interject with absolute nonsense when he is the person who has the carriage of introducing this unfortunate Bill into the Senate. The fact is that the powers possessed by the ABS and the penalties for non-compliance were introduced into the Parliament by John Howard, the then Minister responsible for the ABS in 1981. The same press release went on to compound the nonsense by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Senator Sheil's stand against the controversial Census Act is certain to gain wide public support, especially in view of this week's claim that Australians could soon be forced to take compulsory blood tests and divulge details of their sex lives. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is nonsense. To indicate just how much nonsense it is, it may be of some interest to Senator Sheil to know the genesis of that claim. Claims were made some time ago, I think originally by the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, that the ABS was proposing to take these steps. A number of national newspapers published those claims without bothering to check with the ABS whether the claims were correct. The ABS went to the Press Council of Australia and complained. I can assure honourable senators, from personal experience, that it is not an easy matter to persuade the Press Council, which has as a fundamental tenet freedom of the press, to recommend that a newspaper print a retraction. On this occasion the Australian Bureau of Statistics succeeded and all of the eight major national newspapers that had published this nonsense were subsequently required by the Press Council to publish retractions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that a number of interest groups-and this occurs constantly-have suggested that such intrusive questions be asked. People are always suggesting to the ABS that various questions be asked. However, at no time has the ABS ever made a decision that such questions would be asked. I have described precisely the very strict legislative requirements that are placed on the ABS in relation to the asking of questions. It has a national advisory council which considers all such requests. That council's reports are tabled annually in this Parliament. Further, the ABS has prescribed legislative guidelines for what goes in the surveys, which guidelines have to be tabled in this House and are then subject to disallowance. In the face of that regime, Senator Sheil says that the ABS is, in fact, ridden by private groups with hobbyhorses and that it has untrammelled power to ask people the most intrusive of questions. I think I have adequately demonstrated that the statement that Senator Sheil has just made is utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABS has never proposed to take blood samples from 14,000 Australians. It never proposed to ask people about their sex lives. It never proposed to ask people whether or not they used condoms. That was never a proposal of the ABS. It is on that false foundation that Senator Sheil has, on his own account, brought this foolish legislation into the Parliament. I must say that I am profoundly disappointed that, with very little thought at all, I would think, the Opposition has elected to support Senator Sheil's legislation, with its fundamental problems for any ensuing Australian government-which I will describe in a minute-and by so doing to strike down the very foundations on which the ABS operates, which were introduced into the House of Representatives by John Howard, as Treasurer, in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall quote from the second reading speech of the then Treasurer in 1981, when he introduced this legislation that Senator Sheil wants to destroy, a statement that is as fundamentally correct now as it was then. This is what John Howard said during the second reading debate on the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>This area brings very much into focus one of the problems that any government faces, that is, balancing principles and conflicting priorities. I dare say that if we carried out a survey of a cross-section of the Australian community and we said to those people: ``Do you believe that governments should be well informed and should have available to them a wide range of information about the habits, the wants, the desires, the assets and the capabilities of the Australian community on which to base, in a sound way, government decisions?'' the overwhelming majority of the people surveyed would simply say ``yes'' to that proposal as being self evidently valid. I suggest that if we asked an equally representative group of Australians this question: ``Do you believe that governments should ask a lot of questions about your life, should ask intrusive questions, should pry into what you do, should want to know more and more about what you do?'' the answer to that question would be an equally resounding ``no''. That in a sense is the problem that any government has in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have tried to do is to balance those two aspirations as much as we possibly can. Of course we need information. Of course governments have to ask questions, whatever political persuasion they are. Of course we need sound statistical data on which to base our decisions in whatever area those decisions are. But equally there is a growing and legitimate community resentment towards over-intrusive government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In response to interjections from honourable senators opposite about the non-relevance of the statements that John Howard made in 1981, I point out that the statement I have just read is as relevant today as it was then. As I have said before, the basis on which Senator Sheil has introduced this legislation is factual nonsense. He has continued to assert that factual nonsense during this debate. There will be a health survey conducted in 1989. It will be conducted under prescriptive guidelines that will have to be tabled in this Parliament and will be subject to the disallowance of this Parliament. There will be no blood tests--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will discuss that in due course. There will be no blood tests, no questions will be asked about people's sex lives, and there will be no questions asked about condoms-and nor were there ever going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of this supposed wave of complaints and resentment from the community, again the facts might be useful in this debate rather than the fiction that Senator Sheil is peddling. Less than one one- hundredth of one per cent of all the people questioned in any of the surveys that the ABS has ever conducted have had to be directed to respond to the questions. For all the population censuses that have been conducted, that is, involving 16 million Australians, a total of 39 people have been prosecuted for not providing information. In relation to labour force statistics, 35,000 households are surveyed every month by the ABS for those essential figures. Out of those 35,000 households, eight people have been prosecuted in five years. As to the household expenditure survey that has come up for so much attention just recently, the number of people prosecuted has been nil. These figures relate to the total number of surveys undertaken. They do not relate just to last year or the year before; these are total, historical surveys. In relation to the national health surveys the number of people prosecuted has been nil, as was the case in relation to all other national household surveys.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the problems that will be caused by this legislation not just for this Government but for any government that is properly trying to deliver services and public resources where they are needed most. If the compulsion is removed completely from providing information it will particularly affect the corporate sector, the private sector, the individual sector. This applies equally to the corporate sector. Senator Sheil might be interested to know that it is a fact that in Australia about 1,000 companies in total provide about 60 per cent of the entire gross domestic product of this country. Some 1,000 companies provide that information. Many of them would choose not to provide it if it was not compulsory, not because they were trying to hide anything but because, it is acknowledged-and no-one tries to pretend that it is not-it is inconvenient for those companies and it costs them some time and trouble to provide that information. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said time and trouble, and I concede quite freely that it costs them money. A direct and substantial community benefit is derived-an essential benefit. I might add that among the figures that would be rendered useless if those companies were not compelled to provide the information-and this legislation would remove that compulsion-would be the consumer price index figures. The average weekly earnings figures, which are essential for proper social planning in this country and the provision of social resources to people who need them most, and the retail sales figures which are so vital, would be destroyed. The reason is obvious, and I would have thought that it would be obvious even to Senator Sheil: if the information is not compulsory and is provided, as Senator Calvert suggests, only by people who want to provide it, that will result in a gross bias in the reliability of the figures. It is obvious that a group that chooses not to provide information will be distinctly different from a group that does provide it. That would render the surveys statistically useless. In fact, it would render them useless to the point of it not being worth collecting the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the greatest respect, I suggest to Senator Sheil that, as John Howard said, quite correctly, in 1981 when he introduced the legislation that Senator Sheil is now trying to strike down, it is essential for governments to be possessed of accurate statistical data. It is essential that the ABS be possessed of the very limited powers that it has-and it has never had any other-that is, the requirement for people to answer the questions and fining people if they do not. It is essential for the ABS to be provided with those powers. If not, and people simply choose not to provide the information, statistically, as any polling company will say-Senator Sheil should go to his own research people for advice on this-the information that would result would literally not be worth collecting. We would have no reliable figures on the CPI or on average weekly earnings, on which so many government decisions are based, and we would have absolutely no reliable information on retail sales. The reality is that all of the series of economic surveys done by the ABS and all of the series of social research and data collection done by the ABS would be fundamentally destroyed by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give honourable senators opposite the benefit of the doubt, but there has been a knee-jerk reaction to this Bill of Senator Sheil's: people have been prepared to accept at face value the assertion that he has continued to make in this debate that the ABS is empowered with ASIS-like powers to knock down doors, to forcibly enter premises-to quote Senator Sheil again-and to compulsorily acquire documents. It has no such powers. I am sure that honourable senators opposite have simply accepted the very foundation on which Senator Sheil has based this legislation-that the ABS was proposing to ask people about their sex lives and about their use of condoms-when in fact it was proposing to do absolutely nothing of the sort. The very premise on which this legislation is based is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask the Opposition and certainly the Australian Democrats to consider at this late stage not supporting this legislation. It will totally destroy the fundamental avenue that all governments of any persuasion need in directing scarce resources to that area of the Australian community where they are required most. I think it is unfortunate that Senator Sheil has brought into this House a piece of legislation which dramatically and radically alters the fundamentally sound basis on which the ABS was set up by John Howard, as its responsible Minister, in 1981, which will substantially-I think totally would be more accurate-destroy its ability to collect statistically useful and reliable information, and which thereby will greatly disadvantage the community of Australia, through governments of whatever persuasion, in providing scarce public resources to the areas of our community that need them most. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Census and Statistics Amendment (Voluntary Provision of Survey Information) Bill, introduced by Senator Sheil, which seeks to provide for the voluntary provision of information under the Census and Statistics Act. Clearly, we are not discussing the total introduction of voluntary exercise with regard to all of the activities of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Indeed, Senator Sheil accepts that there should be available to the Bureau the ability to compel people to answer questions with regard to the census. Of course, the difficulty statistically is that the census is not defined under the Act, and in that sense Senator Sheil's Bill would probably end up failing on that technicality alone; and the Government, using the notion of the census, could reintroduce the material as a census exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That apart, I think we have to see clearly, that, if Senator Sheil is happy for compulsion to be used in the census part of surveys, but not in other parts, the distinction is not with regard to whether citizens should be compelled to answer questions but with regard to what questions they should be compelled to answer. That is a slightly different philosophical basis from the one I thought Senator Sheil was arguing in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I think everybody acknowledges-indeed, Senator Collins, in reading out Mr Howard's second reading speech on the introduction of census legislation in 1981, made it clear-that any responsible government must have information upon which it is able to base its policy determinations. I would like to spend a little time on that fundamental proposition, because I think some of the things that have been said in this debate cast some doubt on it. One thread that runs through the Estimates committee reports on this year's Budget, the questions asked at Question Time and the questions placed on notice is the demanding from government of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we believe we can demand information from government is that we believe that the Government ought to have that information before it makes a decision. Indeed, if it went ahead and made a decision in the absence of information, it would be condemned not only by people outside but, I am sure, by everybody in the Opposition. To suggest that governments ought to legislate or ought to engage in policy decision making in the absence of information is to promote an irrationality that I am quite sure nobody in here would want to adhere to. So we want two things-and I believe Senator Sheil agrees with both: first, that governments ought to be able to compel people to answer questions-Senator Sheil has accepted that, as seen by the mention of the census in the legislation-and, secondly, that the Government needs information and ought to gather it so that it can properly base its policy and decision making processes. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Sheil is objecting to is a particular exercise-the household expenditure survey. I think we ought to go to the analysis of that because, if what we have said so far is correct, there is a dispute not about whether the Government ought to have the ability to compel people to answer questions, but about which questions people ought to be compelled to answer. It is interesting to look back in this exercise to 1905, as I had the misfortune to do. I am not sure why I had to do this unfortunate exercise; I think I was not in the party room at the time and I ended up with it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins drew the short straw as well. This legislation started in 1905. Even at that early stage compulsion was built in. The requirement to get information was obviously felt to be important even at that early stage in our Federal history. This is not something that has arisen recently; it has been going on for quite some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1905 the Bureau was basically looking at the census part. This is included in Senator Sheil's second reading speech and, by implication, in his amending Bill, because he does not seek to take away the compulsion in that area. In addition to the census which it said shall be taken, the statistical information also had to be collected and at that stage the legislation said, `The Statistician shall, if the Minister so directs by notice in writing, collect such statistical information in relation to the matters so prescribed as is specified in the notice'. In other words, it was a fairly open-ended exercise in 1905. A Minister, when needing some information, could merely direct the Statistician to nip out and talk to the three or four cows wandering around, ask them what they thought and then provide the information to the Minister. One would imagine that in 1905 the amount of information that would successfully have been able to be acquired, processed and used in policy determination would have been quite small. But as the years went on we had a series of amending Bills. One of those Bills occurred in 1975 and in it was mentioned a very interesting body which does not seem to have been mentioned in the debate so far-the Australian Statistics Advisory Council. The functions of the Council are:</PARA>
<PARA>To advise the Minister and the Statistician in relation to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the improvement, extension and co-ordination of statistical services provided for public purposes in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) annual and longer term priorities and programs of work that should be adopted in relation to major aspects of the provision of those statistical services; and</PARA>

In following up these concerns that Statistics Advisory Council would seem an appropriate body to be involved. In addition, amendments were made which required the tabling of various documents. I think that all honourable senators in this place, if they manage to keep all the stuff, probably have bulging files somewhere of all the material generated by Don Cameron before he left for other climes-material which is obviously still being generated by his office in his absence because it is still being pumped out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned with the legality or otherwise of the current exercise. While I know that some members and senators were quite happy to go on radio and tell people that they should not fill the questionnaires in, when I was asked that particular question, being a slightly more cautious person, I said, `I am not about to suggest that people should break the law of the land'. Quite frankly, whether it is legal or not is not a matter for this chamber to determine unless we wish, in fact, to pass amending legislation. It is a matter for the courts to determine. There are processes for bringing that particular aspect before the courts. I understand that if the matter is not before the courts, the process has been put in train, and several lawyers are now earning their incomes from it. That is the way the matter should proceed. That is where finally the legality of the exercise will have to be tested. I have read several opinions from several sources. Obviously, those opinions will be used and be grist to the mill for the final resolution through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that in terms of a procedure that should have been followed, the proposal should have been tabled. I really do not think that there is any need to go round splitting hairs quite so finely as has been done. Why not inform the Parliament of the types of things that go on?

That will actually negate one of the arguments for tabling. That tabling probably would have helped the Bureau and probably now it regrets having acted in the way it did. Knowing the number of pieces of paper that are in my room, I know that I would not have been dashing to the chamber to grab hold of the tabled proposal myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings us to the current survey for which there have been a series of arrangements made over time for the collection of information. I must admit that I find myself in some difficulties here because I am not trained as a statistician. I have sought advice with regard to the statistical base of information collected on a voluntary basis. I would incline to the proposition, if we want to put it in these terms, that there should be voluntary compliance in regard to the collection of a lot of the information, under particular conditions. The difficulty was that when I suggested that to some statisticians I was roundly taken to task for suggesting such a thing. My suggestion was that where there was voluntary compliance and people did not comply then the sample should be redrawn in such a way as to enable one to comply with the original sample. I was told that that was utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I am not a statistician so I was not able to say whether that proposition was nonsense or not. However, I know that there has in fact been a much higher response to the current survey than to the 1984 survey. Presumably this is as a result of Senator Sheil's activities. Therefore, he may in fact have assisted the compliance rather than prevented the compliance. I do not know what other difference there is between now and then, other than people making a lot of noise about this survey. Presumably, that is why the response to the survey has gone up. Indeed, the response has gone up so far that 97 per cent of households have actually complied. I know that that is a fairly high compliance rate because I used to engage in surveys from time to time. I know that if I had got anything like a response of 97 per cent I would have said, `I will go home now, I have got enough'. </PARA>

I would have thought that the Government and the statisticians would be quite happy with the type of return they are getting at the moment. If one looks at the number of times the Bureau has actually bothered to prosecute anyone under the Census Act one will realise that it would not bother to prosecute people who do not respond to this survey either simply because the costs involved in prosecution are not commensurate with the types of returns the Bureau would get. In fact, the Bureau would not significantly boost its returns nor boost the reliability of the information it gets by prosecuting people. I am trying to say in a practical sense that I cannot see the Bureau involving itself in any exercise which would lead to a prosecution of citizens in this area if the compliance rate of 97 per cent continues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total number of people to be surveyed is equivalent to one household in every thousand households. I have looked at the survey material. The material concerned is quite voluminous in terms of the number of pieces of paper that one gets. However, when one actually starts to go through and answer the questions one can actually skip quite a number of pages here and there for quite a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, I think that answering the survey would take quite some considerable time. I must admit that one would need a very good system of bookkeeping at home in order to be able to comply with the survey in a meaningful way. I suppose that is the guts of my worry. I am concerned that while we may be getting 97 per cent compliance, what is it that we are getting in that 97 per cent? Originally the premise of my surveys was that I wanted information. However, my worry at the moment is what type of information we might be getting out of this survey because the material is so voluminous. I wonder whether there may be other methods, for example, surveying a variety of households with only part of the material. I know the difficulty there lies in the cross-tabulations which are also necessary for information purposes. In other words, we want to know for information purposes, for example, how many families rely on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example. Many years ago I conducted a number of surveys on education in my own State. I found out some alarming things about education and its provision. I did not even look at the schools; I looked at the homes. I found in my own city of Brisbane that the so-called high-class or costly suburbs had on average a little less that two children per household. Suburbs such as Senator Sheil's St Lucia, Kenmore and so on had fewer than two children per household. However, those households had three to four bedrooms. However, if one then went across to Inala, essentially a post-war Housing Commission development, one found that on average there were households of one to two bedrooms but with the number of children going up to over six. What that says about education provision is that no matter what we do in the schools the children at home do not have anywhere to study. One can see immediately from those statistics that, regardless of anything else, what is required is a significant boost in Inala to enable those children to have parity of educational opportunity. What I am saying is that even from that minimal data one can devise policy directions that could have significant impacts on people. Without the data, one would be floating to be able to pinpoint the type of policy direction heeded. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it very clear that the Australian Democrats support very strongly the work of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the notion that it ought to be able to collect data. We believe that the Bureau ought to have the power to compel people to respond. I know that at the end of the day one is very concerned about this. There is a great deal of concern about two matters. The first is the inordinate length of time for which the Bureau keeps its material before it is destroyed. The Act says quite explicitly that that material has to be entered and then destroyed. However, when one looks at how long it takes before the actual paper containing people's names is destroyed, one sees that it sometimes stretches into years. Why is that material kept when the data was entered long ago? No good reason has been given. There were some mutterings about computer failure and so on, but obviously once one has got the backups one is all right. I find that a great worry. </PARA>
<PARA> My second worry concerns the Government's move to use various instrumentalities either to fundraise or to pay for part of their operations by selling material. We now find the Bureau is involved in this activity. Do not get me wrong; I am not averse to the Bureau collecting data and selling it. I think that if we have the data we should use it. It is absurd even to collect it if we do not intend to use it. However, the problem is that an invitation is offered to the Bureau to use its powers of compulsion to collect information which it then sells as a commercial product to the private sector, because the private sector does not have the powers of compulsion to collect that type of information. I think that that could and should be catered for-it is not catered for in the Act-by a specific requirement that the collection of data must always be for the purpose of policy development by governments; in other words, if the Bureau is not able to justify the collection of that data for its primary role, it cannot collect it. That would rule out questions such as the brand of toothpaste, lawnmower or whatever people use. A lot of that is profitable information. After all, a lot of bodies in the community, without compulsory powers, collect such material. The Bureau could get into that area, using its compulsory powers-there is nothing in the Act which prevents that; that is where the Act could and should be strengthened-rather than our going down the avenue that Senator Sheil suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> What we should do is look at the problems in 1988 with information gathering and collection. One way of dealing with it is Senator Sheil's method of moving away from compulsion to a voluntary exercise. I am not convinced by the arguments put so far-I think that there will be other speakers on the Opposition side-as to how we will still be able to provide the database that I know I and my colleagues want. I know that I want that data because I want government to make a decision based on facts. I find it very difficult to say, on behalf of my party, that we are quite happy to go to a voluntary exercise. I acknowledge Senator Sheil's concerns. I have expressed the same concerns publicly and have suggested that possibly one way of handling the matter is by voluntary exercise, as Senator Sheil suggests. However, in reviewing the information, I must admit that the first position I took I have now had to change. At the moment I cannot see that if we move down this line I can still get the type of data that I believe government should have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that it will be in government by the end of next year. It will be looking for this type of data in terms of its ongoing policy decision making. Every government must do that if it is not going to simply fly blind. I have not yet heard how we will protect the database-I am quite sure that the Opposition wants it as much as does the Government-under the voluntary exercise that is suggested in the Bill. I wonder whether subsequent Opposition speakers might address that. I would certainly be very interested in listening to their arguments for the protection of the database. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators know, from our stance on the privacy legislation, that my Party does not want to be involved in an exercise which intrudes on privacy. Indeed, that is why we opposed the tax file number system, although it was accepted by the Opposition. The Opposition says that it wants the information to be given voluntarily. We have not seen whether that will be the case with higher education. The Bill which the Opposition said it will accept makes it compulsory, so I will be looking with interest at the support that it may have for our amendment, designed to make it a voluntary exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator might be able to do that but, as she well knows, other people in the community do not have such funds. Many women supporting children and trying to educate themselves do not have such funds. They have to be able to do so, as it were, on the never never. Senator Patterson knows that as well as I do. Since 1972, when the fees were abolished, women have used higher education progressively to move themselves within the community. That is particularly so in single parent families where women have other responsibilities and seek to move from an area of dependency into an area of work. Rather than putting disadvantages and hurdles in their way, we should be encouraging them to do that. They will not be able to pay up-front, so they will be compelled to give their tax file number. All along we have supported the privacy principle. I accept the privacy argument: I think that it is a powerful one. That is why I suggested that my concern about privacy is the non-destruction of material by the Bureau for such a long period. The longer the material stays around, the more it must leave open the possibility of abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unless the Opposition is able to come up with some more cogent reasons as to how we can protect the data base that is required by government for decision making, I cannot see how we can go to a voluntary exercise. The other problem I have with a voluntary exercise-as I say, it may be that there are statisticians in the Opposition who have yet to speak-is that it has been clearly conveyed to me through information provided to me that the type of voluntary procedure that I have suggested in the past is a non-goer in statistical terms. All I am able to do is simply take that advice-that one would not be able to conduct a statistically valid survey under those conditions. In relation to those two points I will be listening carefully to subsequent speakers. At the moment I cannot see how we can support the proposition that the exercise be voluntary, although I believe that other amendments should be made by government to follow through the types of things that Senator Sheil has raised. </PARA>

If corporations were to be in a situation where providing information to the Government was voluntary, presumably because of very large costs involved they would no longer do so. Under those circumstances many of the Acts which are written in such a way as to provide automatic increases based on average weekly earnings, movements in the consumer price index and so forth would not be able to operate. For example, the automatic rises provided to pensioners could no longer occur. I hope that Senator Sheil will be able to respond to this, the last of the three items I have difficulty with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. I must say that Senator Macklin carried out a nice analysis of the situation. He reminded me of Senator McLean in his maiden speech, when he gave a very accurate analysis of the political situation in Australia and then came to the wrong conclusions. I think Senator Macklin has done the same thing with regard to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. As an example, I think of the way the Australian Democrats strove and fought to ensure privacy with regard to the tax file number, yet here we have the Australian Bureau of Statistics able to ask people to produce their income tax returns. There is a conflict there that should be addressed by people who are trying to analyse the Census and Statistics Amendment (Voluntary Provision of Survey Information) Bill 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go back to Senator Collins's remarks. He accused me of pushing emotional issues such as sexual habits, blood tests for people and other personal information. I would like to remind him that these items were under active consideration by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and its working party at the time the press releases he referred to were made. I am sure that it was only because of those press releases that the Bureau of Statistics withdrew from any inquiries into those personal areas. There have been only 38 prosecutions for failure to provide information to the Bureau, which is an indication to me that the Bureau has proceeded with only those prosecutions it felt it could win. It is an indication that it has withdrawn from many more prosecutions. Because of the activities of its officers, who were perhaps a little bit insensitive in questioning people, it decided not to go on with the cases. Nevertheless, the interviews by Bureau officers were an harassment and a threat to the households which were being subjected to survey. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the powers of entry of the Australian Statistician. Senator Collins said that the Statistician has never had any powers to enter premises.</PARA>

There is no intent in this Bill to deny the Bureau of Statistics access to figures which it requires to establish the indices upon which the information it provides to the Government is based. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is not intended to destroy the Bureau of Statistics, as claimed by Senator Collins. The Bureau can go ahead and ask all the questions it wants. All the Bill seeks to do is make survey questions voluntary for everything but the census itself, which I would have thought was perfectly reasonable. Under the Census and Statistics Act the Bureau can ask all the questions it wants of the corporate sector-a point that Senator Collins was worried about. When it comes to the consumer price index (CPI), average weekly earnings and pension increases, a far better solution would be for the Government to stop spending more than it earns and to stop causing an increase in the CPI. It should cut its expenditure and taxes and fix the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us not confuse the census with what Senator Collins was talking about. The honourable senator was talking about the supply of statistics by the corporate sector.

I was merely pointing out that if the Government behaved more responsibly, it would be better able to determine effectively the CPI, average weekly earnings and pension increases without invading the privacy of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin conceded that a powerful argument could be put forward in respect of privacy. I think it just depends on where one sits in this Parliament as to how powerful one thinks that argument is. For me, privacy is the most powerful consideration. As I said at the outset, government was invented to protect privacy, right up to and including the defence of the realm. But there has been a naked exercise of power by a public servant in that he attempted to carry out a compulsory survey without tabling in Parliament what he proposed to do. Not only that, he defended the situation and there has been no end of argument one way or the other about what has happened. It is fundamental that if he wants to make the answers to his questions compulsory, he has to table his intentions in the Parliament. By the way, there is no provision under which we can reject what he proposes. So why did he not propose it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am putting forward is perfectly reasonable. I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I am sorry that Senator Macklin is not supporting the Bill, but perhaps not all the Australian Democrats feel the same way as he does. I see the issue as far more important than dividing it up into private and corporate sectors. I see it as an issue of privacy for people, which I consider important. The Democrats argued strongly for the protection of privacy in the Australia Card Bill and in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill. Yet, they do not display the same attitude when it comes to a perfectly reasonable request that will not deny the Australian Bureau of Statistics any information at all. In fact, the Bill will probably make it easier for the Bureau to operate. The Statistician himself says that when his officers are interviewing people in the field they act with delicacy and sensitivity. All they would have to do is act with a little bit more delicacy and sensitivity. If they conduct a slightly wider survey than they do at the moment all the figures that they want will be available to them. They just have to behave in the same way when obtaining information from the corporate sector. As a hospital proprietor, I supplied statistics to the Bureau of Statistics for years and I did not mind at all. I put them all in, as do many businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard Senator Calvert say tonight that most members of the agricultural community would be perfectly happy as part of their civic responsibility and duty to supply the Government with the figures it required. They do it voluntarily. But, no, the Government wants to make it compulsory. There must be a reason for that. I know what the reason is: the Government wants to indulge in social engineering. I am sure that the Hawke Government has been using the Bureau for this purpose. This is why it wants to persist with requiring compulsory answers to its questions. I just do not happen to believe in that sort of social engineering. I suppose it depends on one's political philosophy on just which side of the line one falls. My appeal is not an emotional one and it is not based on a whole lot of hysteria, as was claimed tonight in the Senate by Government speakers. I think I have explained the facts sufficiently well.

<PARA> ``(5a) Any such resolution shall be laid before each House of the Parliament and the request therein shall be deemed to have been agreed to by the Parliament unless within fifteen sitting days either House pass a resolution declining so to agree.''</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this amendment because it is appropriate that there is a convenient mechanism which is capable of being initiated by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Assembly for the transfer of additional ordinances and inherited laws to that Assembly. It is also appropriate that the right to decline to transfer such a law should rest with this Parliament. In other words, the ACT Assembly should have a prima facie right to take over ordinances which it says belong to it. sub-clause (5a) is a protection for the Federal Parliament to stop this happening if that is the wish of Federal Parliament. So the initial decision would be with the ACT Assembly, but the right to veto would remain with this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>This issue has already been canvassed at great length, but I believe that this is a matter of the greatest importance. I believe that the principle enshrined in the Government's Bill is wrong, and I believe that it should have been addressed in a separate self-contained Bill similar to that which has now been removed from the agenda. I believe that clauses 5 to 9 of my Bill would have taken care of this aspect and should have been transferred to this legislation. I do not expect to succeed because of what has happened previously but, because of its importance, I plan to call for a division if my amendment does not receive the support of either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, I think we canvassed this issue before. The right of disallowance that is maintained here is the same right-no more and no less-as that retained in the Northern Territory. Yet here in the Australian Capital Territory there is obviously a greater imperative to keep it because, as I said earlier in the debate, it is here that we have the ultimate constitutional responsibility. It is worth noting that this power has never been used in the Northern Territory and here, where we have an even stronger right, I would imagine that we would almost always be able to deal with these matters by consultation and negotiation. I think it is a reasonable power to retain given our constitutional responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, as I have said to the Australian Democrats previously to this debate, our view is also that a cautious approach to self-government is sensible and, for the time being anyway, this security should remain in the Bill. As I said in my second reading stage speech, we do not necessarily lock ourselves into that position forever. We think that, perhaps after a certain period when the Bill and self-government have had a chance to apply in practice and they have both been found to be sound, some of these extra safeguards can be removed by amendment. At the moment, as I indicated, in adopting that cautious approach we would prefer to see the safeguard remain and therefore we are not prepared to support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the recent referendum debates and the vote returned by the Australian people I guess I can understand the Government's point of view, but I find it hard to understand the Opposition's point of view. The Opposition campaigned very heavily on the side of States rights as opposed to rights being maintained by the Federal Parliament. Here the Australian Democrats are supporting territorial rights so that the Governor-General may not disallow an enactment after six months if he sees fit so to do. As I said before, if we do not gain the support of either the Government or the Opposition for this amendment I shall call for a division.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not go before Parliament. The other point to make is that it is a pretty long bow to draw for Senator Jenkins to equate this in some way with States rights. Clearly the constitutional responsibility which the Commonwealth possesses with respect to the ACT is a lot different to what it lacks in respect of the States. It is just not the same argument. This is not a State rights argument at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the argument put forward by the Minister and by Senator Hill that really we should give this a trial and that there should be some backstop, as it were, because of the possible inexperience of some persons who may be elected to the Assembly. In fairness to them and to the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), I acknowledge that there is a need at least for the time being for clauses 33 and 34. However, I would prefer that decisions by the Executive Government-that is, the Governor-General-be referred and tabled in both Houses of the national Parliament. At the present time ordinances in the ACT are tabled here. We have the right to disallow those ordinances. It seems to me that, in this new Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation scheme this Parliament loses any right that it previously had and the Government assumes that right solely. Had I thought of this before I would have moved a further amendment which would have left clauses 33 and 34 intact but which would have required the Government to table its disallowance in both houses of Parliament. That instrument would then be the subject of disallowance by the Parliament itself.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem that is facing us here is the transition problem between where we are and where we want to go. The difficulty I have with the current situation as expressed by the Government is, as suggested by Senator Harradine, that the Parliament has been reduced in power. I could put it this way: currently an ordinance is drawn up at the behest of the Executive by those people involved in the administration of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It could then be disallowed by this Parliament. Under the new arrangement we could have one item being raised by the ACT Assembly but disallowed by the Executive Government. Yet this item may have the full support of this Parliament. The Government has managed to remove this Parliament from effective control and substituted itself in its place. I know that Senator Reid, who is in the chamber at the moment, has moved many of these ordinances herself in regard to ACT matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that an ordinance is overwhelmingly supported by the Assembly. It may even be overwhelmingly supported by honourable senators in this chamber or in the other place, yet it may be disallowed by the Executive Government. I think that it is moving the Executive Government into a situation that it may be very uncomfortable with. It may sound like a good idea but, at the end of the day, the Executive Government may find itself bearing the weight of many decisions that it might not want to take. It might be in the interests not only of this Parliament but also of the Minister who will suddenly become responsible because the Minister, not this Parliament or the Assembly, will have sole power. I would not have thought that that was such a good move. Ultimately, the avenue is there for the Northern Territory as well. I recognise that. It has rarely been used although threatened on occasions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may never have been used but I can remember it being effectively threatened in the last couple of years relating to matters in the legal area. It must have been a number of years ago because Senator Gareth Evans was the Attorney-General at the time; so it was in 1983 or 1984. It was to do with the exercise in the Northern Territory that I was being extensively lobbied on. I remember that Senator Evans made some very strong statements in this chamber in regard to that particular matter. Ultimately, it did not come to pass and the Northern Territory Government did not proceed down that avenue. Although I cannot be held to it, it may have had to do with trial in certain areas. The heart of the matter went to the preservation of the right to trial. The Government has moved into a very odd context. I am not disputing the fact that it needs a fall-back because no Governor is proposed in this context. That fall back is acceptable. Of course, the difficulty is that the Governor-General effectively means the Executive Government. I would have thought that it would have been possible to organise it in such a way as to allow the Executive Government to be removed from that type of pressure yet still provide the back stop that the Government felt was necessary under the circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just make one comment: the reality is that this is the same provision, the same power, that the Commonwealth reserved for itself in the Northern Territory. It has never been used in the Northern Territory. What is more, the Northern Territory, which is run by a government with philosophies not exactly akin to my philosophies, is not deluging us with requests for change. This is a non-issue; this current debate is a non-issue. If we are to have divisions on matters such as this we will be here for a very long time indeed this evening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are not exactly in the same situation as far as their relationship with the Federal Parliament is concerned. I would like to remind the Senate of the debate that has just been pursued on the Australian Capital Territory (Protection of the National Interest) Bill 1988. It is a pity that Senator Harradine is not in the chamber because this would have allayed a few of his anxieties. It is stated in that Bill that Acts of Parliament and not ordinances should be the method of dealing with any matters that pertain to the ACT. However, the Governor-General would be allowed to make certain ordinances but they would then be laid before each House of Parliament within five sitting days. They would exist for only three months during which time the matter could be sorted out. This is the sort of compromise which would protect the National Parliament's interest but, at the same time, give the people of the ACT genuine self-government-not a Clayton's self-government where Acts could simply be dismissed by the Executive of the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

The amendment will also state that that instrument would be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. I foreshadow that so that honourable senators can think about it.

Under the provisions of the Bill the Parliament is taken out of the legislation altogether, it has no role in respect of the laws governing the Australian Capital Territory other than those listed in schedule 4 of the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, on any ordinary reading, the amendment probably does not mean anything at all or have any effect. However, any effect that it might have would probably be detrimental. If the intention is to bind the Commonwealth to implement the findings of the Grants Commission, I think this is an entirely inappropriate way of handling government finances. This seems to be entirely unnecessary. Examinations that I have made indicate that there are no precedents for the Commonwealth's paying to smaller States or Territories a lesser amount than that assessed by the Grants Commission as being appropriate. Notwithstanding the views of my colleague next to me, Senator Walsh, there may even be a circumstance in which, in the transitional period, the ACT Government may require greater funding than that assessed by the Grants Commission, which, if this clause means anything at all, would probably be impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The arrangement that the Government is proposing is consistent with the normal arrangements for smaller States and the Northern Territory. The proposed amendment does not apply to the States or the Northern Territory.

Borrowings by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will be treated in a consistent way with Commonwealth approval of State borrowings on the same basis as for the Northern Territory at the moment. Because of the status of the ACT and the Northern Territory as Territories rather than States, different arrangements are required from those which apply between the Commonwealth and the States, which are embodied in the Loan Council arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats' proposal is quite contrary to the operation of the Westminster system as it has developed in Australia, with the Executive's responsibility for initiating money Bills and the role of the legislature in effective scrutiny. It is different from any provision that operates in this Parliament, in any State Parliament or in the Parliament of the Northern Territory in relation to money Bills, in all of which instances the initiation of money Bills is restricted to the Executive. As a matter of effective and sensible Budget management for any government, this is a matter that needs to be retained in the hands of the Executive. As a supporter of democracy, I support enhanced powers for the legislature, but they cannot include, in my view, this sort of proposal to initiate expenditure. That would otherwise negate the Executive's responsibility for preparing and proposing the Budget, which is a fundamental requirement of the concept of responsible government not only in Australia but certainly in terms of Australian precedents everywhere-the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. It is not appropriate that we should start changing this in the way that is proposed. I think it is neither sensible in practice nor appropriate in principle.

There is a potential, if very minor, problem. Probably it would not operate to exclude any person from membership of the Assembly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been expressed previously by both the Government and the Opposition that we should not seek to put forward legislation in this place which is different from legislation applying to the Northern Territory. I would like to suggest that, as the ACT is different in the respect that so many of its inhabitants are public servants, the Senate should in fact consider whether it is brave enough to start moving in another direction with this legislation. I believe that we should start moving to allow a person who is a public servant to take up a seat in the Assembly without having to resign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to cite a case that happened in Western Australia at the last Federal election. A person who had a high position in the State police force stood as a Liberal Party candidate in that election. That person had to resign under the provision which is normally called a technical resignation. However, when that person did not gain a seat in the Federal Parliament and tried to be reinstated in the police force, this was refused. I think that, if we can in any way move in a direction in this chamber which would prevent that sort of thing occurring, we certainly should do that. We should not feel ourselves bound by what has happened in the past simply because it was then a good idea. I think we have to look realistically at the present.

I could spend time going through the various provisions of all the States, those of the Commonwealth and those of the Northern Territory, which were imposed by this Parliament. Provisions of a similar nature to that which we propose now be included are to be found within such legislation. We presume that the omission here was not deliberate. We believe that it is important that a person who stands for this important office, or a person who serves in this important office, not be in the position of being an undischarged bankrupt.

On behalf of the Government, I wish to say that I cannot accept that part of Senator Hill's amendment which refers to bankruptcy. As recommended by the Senate committee which examined this matter some years ago, we ought not to be putting a stigma on those who are declared bankrupt. Many Australians who are put in that unfortunate position go on to lead lives that benefit the rest of the community. I cannot see-and frankly never could-why bankruptcy should in some way disqualify them from being in parliament, whether in the Australian Capital Territory Assembly or any other legislature. I know that that Senate committee recommended the deletion of two parts of the Constitution which refer to this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would be setting an undesirable precedent and I think it would be inappropriate for the Australian Capital Territory self-governing legislature not to be safeguarded in the same way as other legislatures in this country are from service by undischarged bankrupts. `Undischarged' is the important word. We have no concern about somebody who has unfortunately been through bankruptcy but has put his or her affairs in order and been discharged from that. Our amendment is referring to somebody who is currently bankrupt or, alternatively, has had to enter into some arrangement with respect to his or her debts or property. If we are talking about compounding debts, for instance, creditors being prepared to take lesser amounts, those arrangements can arguably put a person in a position where unsatisfactory influence can be brought to bear on them. We think that that is undesirable. We recognise that the Senate committee which was dealing with the Commonwealth Constitution in 1981 was of a different view. We notice, however, that the Government has not since sought to take that up in relation to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From my point of view, there is certainly a difficulty with the amendment in respect of bankruptcy. This difficulty was raised in a Senate committee inquiry. It was also raised in the first report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform. The fact is that members of the Federal Parliament also face this difficulty. We really cannot change this provision. While Senator Hill said that these matters have been dealt with on their merits, we all know that it is impossible to change the Constitution in these areas. Members of the Parliament suffer because of the possibility of their being sued, taken through every court in the land and losing their seat, not because they might not be guilty of anything but because they do not actually have the resources to be able to sustain that type of battle. They may not be guilty of anything, but they might be made bankrupt for that very reason. I probably speak with a little bit of emotion on this matter having been sued myself by a multi-national company which was going to try that exercise on me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Richardson remembers the passionate plea I made as a Committee member in respect of the unsound mind question. I have a very great and genuine concern that we have in our society a changing view with regard to mental illness. Senator Hill has taken the sweeping phrase `unsound mind' from the Constitution; in fact, I think it is probably in every State Act. I believe that this is one occasion when it is time to take a step forward. Hundreds of thousands of people in our society suffer from schizophrenia. That is not a debilitating disease. This problem, which can be managed with medical attention, in no way prevents people holding down very senior positions within our society. I do not believe that it should prevent a person from serving within an elected assembly. There are many other mental disorders of the same kind. The sweeping phrase `of unsound mind' effectively covers all those people. We are now tending to distinguish more and more between people who fit into the various categories. Undoubtedly some conditions are so disabling that service in an assembly such as this is impossible. I think they are taken out by the ordinary course of events. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other types of mental illnesses which are nowhere near as disabling could technically, I am afraid, still be caught by that very sweeping phrase `of unsound mind'. I think we are moving forward. This is 1988. We are not back in 1901 when that blanket type of phrase was used. I hope that we will not continue to encompass people suffering from some type of mental disability within a phrase which I think is degrading and has been rejected by everybody who deals with people who suffer from some type of mental disability. It would be far better actually to take a step forward and say to the Government that any amendment should specify the disabilities that are of such a serious nature as to disqualify people from being members of the assembly. I really cannot support this exercise of continuing the attitude to mental disabilities that unfortunately was written into our Constitution in 1901. It is still there and is still used, but it creates a stigma in respect of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who hold down jobs of enormous responsibility although they suffer from some type of disability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the point that has been made by Senator Hill about bankruptcy and the pressure that might be able to be applied by other persons against an undischarged bankrupt. At the rate things are going in this country, half the people of Australia will be disenfranchised in terms of standing for public office. The economic and taxation policies of this Government are pushing more and more people into debt. I am quite serious about that. I have just had figures taken out on middle income earners. A middle income earner on $28,600 a year with a dependent spouse and five dependent children has suffered a loss of 12 per cent in his disposable income since July 1984. That is not taking into account the enormous hike in interest rates for mortgages. So half the people will be disqualified under this particular proposal. I am opposed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as `unsound mind' is concerned, I thought that that probably was a prerequisite for standing for parliament. But I think the electors can choose whether or not people are of unsound mind. If they want to vote such people into power, let them be voted into power. Who will determine `unsound mind'? Will the medical profession make such a determination? I know that these matters have been canvassed by a Senate select committee. I believe that Senator Macklin has made a valid point about the question of unsound mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that more and more people are being pushed into bankruptcy by the taxation policies of this Government. I am glad that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is in the chamber. The Government of which he is a member will be defeated at the next polls if it does not do something about recognising families. It allows farmers to write off, for taxation purposes, food for 200 cows. But it does not recognise children who are part of the most important business in this country-that is, raising a family. I wanted to make that point while the Minister is in the chamber because, if he does not take it on board, he will be on the Opposition bench after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to answer Senator Macklin because whether or not one personally likes the expression `unsound mind', the value of it is that it is a term well known to the law. If one reads the law dictionaries, one finds a very precise definition of it. It has been interpreted by the courts many times over. On the definitions, as I read them, clearly a schizophrenic would not fall within that category. So I do not think that that concern is well founded. But that is the reason we used an expression that might seem to be dated, rather than attempting to invent a 1988 expression. If we did that, we would have uncertainty of interpretation. It is better to rely on the precedents that have been established over a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall, although I had almost forgotten, what Senator Macklin had to say as a member of the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform. That was so long ago that my unsound mind had faded on that question. Indeed, I also recall the passion with which he put it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not like the term `unsound mind' either. It is a most unfortunate term. Like Senator Hill, I do not know what other term could be used. It is the accepted legal term. I do not pretend to have the knowledge of a High Court judge or a Queen's Counsel, but I did not believe before this debate began that a person suffering from schizophrenia-which was the example Senator Macklin used-would come within the definition. That being the case, as I said, I am still of the view that the Government should accept the proposal in respect of unsound mind that Senator Hill has put up. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Senator Harradine's comments on that aspect are concerned, while he says people will know and will vote accordingly, the reality is, if we in the Senate are being honest, that people do not always know. Not all of us are exactly household names. Not all of us are voted for because we are superb individuals, brilliant and erudite. Rather, we are voted for because we get a good number on a party ticket. I might say that it has been very helpful to me in the past, so I am not knocking it. I am just making what I think is a fairly obvious point. I do not believe people will always know, and for that reason I am minded to accept at least that part of Senator Hill's amendment which refers to unsound mind, again regretting the use of the term. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think now is the time-and I am sure, Madam Chair, that you would prevent me from doing it anyway-to debate the Government's economic policies. I would have thought that what the Government did with family allowances during the last year was a great leap forward. Unfortunately, the take up rate on that has not been all that it ought to have been and we need to do more to make families aware of it. Certainly the Government's task has to be to look first at those at the bottom and move on up. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as bankruptcy is concerned, certainly there are examples in Australia where bankruptcy rates have risen dramatically-not so much because of this Government's policies, because the highest increases have been in Queensland. I would ascribe that increase to reasons other than the Government's policies. Some of my best friends are bankrupts, to use the well-known phrase. I know a lot of people who have gone bankrupt. That does not mean that they are in some way inferior citizens. I do not want to see that stigma placed on them to prevent them from entering parliament. I think we are past that in this day and age. We are not going to have a referendum on this question. I know it is not my place to announce Government policy, but I think I am pretty safe on that one. I doubt very much that the Government would be minded to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to flag to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) that there are two basic difficulties with the Bill. One is the political aspect, which we accept there will still be a disagreement about-that is, the imposition of the d'Hondt system. The other problem, about which I want to go into some detail as we go through the Bill, is the way in which the d'Hondt system has been drafted. I disagree with both of those matters, but I want to make it clear to the Minister at the outset that the first one we see as a political objection that we will lose on-not necessarily gracefully-because the numbers are against us. I appeal to the Minister to look carefully at the propositions with regard to the way this is drafted. I would take the Minister back to the long debate that we had on the Commonwealth electoral laws in 1983 when he and I sat on the same committee. The usefulness of that exercise was to make sure that we had a rigorous, tight, predictable electoral system. While there may be disagreements about what the system should be, I do not think there should be any disagreements about those particular principles. I believe that, if in the committee stage we could proceed on that basis rather than on the basis of trying to disrupt the system, we would have a better committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this is an excessively flawed Bill for a whole range of reasons that I will go into as we go through it. I do not believe that we should ever enact legislation as poorly drafted as this and so poorly put together. In fact, it has the potential for the most extraordinary problems to arise. In that regard I refer the Minister to Hansard of 2 December 1983 when I moved, amongst a whole host of other amendments, an amendment to insert a clause that I think at the end of the day should be inserted somewhere in this Bill to save it. That clause had to be inserted following an exhaustive committee inquiry, a long debate in the House of Representatives-which is somewhat unusual for that place-in which quite a number of amendments were moved and then a number of amendments were moved in this chamber. In fact, it was my twenty-ninth amendment, and at that stage all of them had been successful. The amendment read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where, on the completion of a transfer of votes under this section, the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, those candidates shall be elected. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment was to remove a technical error that was in the Bill at that time-and acknowledged by the Government as such in the Hansard-which could have resulted in the election of more senators than were permitted to stand for each State. If that had occurred, the election would have been aborted and we would have been in a constitutional crisis because there would have been no government to change the legislation to rectify the error. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not talking here in these technicalities about things that may necessarily happen in this election, the next election, or the election after that; I am talking about the technicalities of the Bill. I believe that, if we are going to enact this legislation, it should be predictable; it should bring up a result that is predictable on every occasion, that is, it should elect 17 members-that is not the case here; on a whole host of possibilities it will not elect 17 members-and it should allow us to have a system in place that will not forever be going off to the courts. I ask that we proceed on that basis whereby issues can arise that are not of a political nature but are of a technical nature. I hope that we can have that technical debate in a reasonable manner. </PARA>

<PARA>This proposed new clause deals with a circumstance where the next available preference cannot be determined because the numbers are duplicated on the ballot paper. A provision in similar terms occurs in clause 18 of the Bill and applies a number of general principles. I will not repeat them all now because that would delay the committee. However, as there is now also provision to transfer, under clause 19 (a), the preferences of provisionally unsuccessful candidates to the next preferred unexcluded party or Independent candidate, the possibility of duplicated numbers frustrating the transfer needs to be catered for. The Government believes that proposed new clause 4a succeeds in catering for that possibility. </PARA>

I do not want to move an amendment but obviously, in the drafting of this legislation, the Minister would have sought advice from the Electoral Commission on the establishment of the body and also on the establishment of the electoral system. I wonder whether the Minister has available the advice which was given and whether that advice can now be provided to the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, want to rub that in a bit. I thought that this box system that we have for the Senate was brought about in order to minimise the number of informal votes. The Government and indeed the Australian Democrats did not go to the optional preferential system. There was a problem because New South Wales had more than 50 candidates in one Senate election. Obviously, this was rather difficult for the electors. It was half a day's job to fill out one's ballot paper. Instead of going for the optional preferential system of voting, the Government, along with the Democrats, decided on this most undemocratic way of voting-the box system on the top of each list of candidates on the ballot paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I raised this issue with the Australian Electoral Commission. I asked whether the first test of a fair system of voting is that it truly reflects the intention of the voter. Of course, the answer was yes. The next question was: did the box system truly reflect the intention of the voter? The answers are now out. As far as I know, they have not been published anywhere but they came out in the discussions the other day in the public hearings of the Electoral Matters Committee. Over two-thirds of the people who voted under the box system did not know to whom their second and subsequent preferences were going. The Government gave the excuse that this was the best way of going about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very noteworthy that the Government in this Bill has turned to the optional preferential system. If it can do it there, it can do it in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It would certainly be a much fairer way and more accurately reflect the intention of the voter than the party box system, which gives advantage to the parties and does not truly reflect the intention of the voter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here dealing with the basic exercise in the Bill. Proposed new clause 18 (1) proposes a system of tallying up the party votes that go to individual candidates. This is certainly a novel system to be used on the Australian electoral scene. It does not have to be used. Alternative systems that are currently in place could be used. The only basic reason that has ever been provided to us is the argument about having a predictable House of Assembly with regard to the Executive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment in Australia the Executive of the day does not control the parliaments of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania or New South Wales, or the Federal Parliament. The only Parliament where the Executive controls the House totally is in Queensland, where there is one House in a rorted system. It is interesting that the establishment in Australia is such that the Executive does not control any Parliament other than the Queensland Parliament. It seems to me that the notion that one has to have some type of system that will rort the votes so that there is a predictable majority result is in no way acceptable to anybody who is interested in democratic theory, let alone democratic practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Having fought for so long in Queensland against a rorted system that is still in place there because of the shameful exercise of the opposition parties in regard to the last referendum-at least the people in Queensland constituted the highest percentage of those who voted to get rid of that system-we now have in Queensland an exercise which flows directly from the electoral system. That illustrates the corruption that exists from top to bottom in that State. It is a direct result of the fact that people cannot, by expressing their views through the ballot box, change the political party in power. It is that important. It corrupts the judiciary, the police and every other level of public office. Anybody who knows the position in Queensland will know that each of those levels will finally be brought to account. That is why the electoral system is of such fundamental importance in any democratic society. That is why we should seek a system which will reflect the votes in the Australian Capital Territory rather than contrive a system that will entrench the political party in power. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember Senator Richardson saying on the first committee in which I took his wise advice, as a person more experienced in politics than I, that if we try to think up a system that will suit ourselves one year, we are sure to find that that system will destroy us the following year. Unfortunately, that wise advice has not been taken in regard to this Bill. Trying to think up a system that takes out the Independents in the Australian Capital Territory will only allow a voter apartheid, meaning that if one does not belong to a major political party one will not count. I intend to demonstrate that as we go through this amendment. Proposed new clause 18 (3) deals with an exclusion process. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>All parties and independent candidates whose base numbers are less than the result of the calculation under subsection (2) shall be excluded from participation in the distribution of seats. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be a very odd operation in this respect. There is a real possibility of excluding at this level people who receive a higher percentage of votes than people who at a later point will win seats. This points to the arbitrariness of the exercise. It is interesting to look at some of the votes cast in the last election as they affect people in this chamber. For example, Senator Hill got 0.03 per cent of the vote in the Senate election in South Australia, Senator Richardson got 0.05 per cent of the vote in New South Wales, Senator Jenkins got 4.5 per cent of the vote in Western Australia, and I got 5.6 per cent of the vote in Queensland. It is interesting that we are told that people will have to be excluded because they are not representative. It is absolute nonsense. But the worst aspect of proposed new clause 18 (3) is that we will take out at this stage people who will have a higher percentage of votes than people who will win a seat at the end of the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall give an example. Party A, with 32 per cent of the vote, would get eight seats under the system suggested here. Party B, with 24 per cent of the vote, would get five seats. Any Independents with, say, 13 per cent, 12 per cent and 10 per cent-this was not unusual in the system that applied to previous Assembly elections-would get three seats. Party F, with 5 per cent of the vote, would get one seat and party G, with 4 per cent, would also get one seat. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the d'Hondt distribution, party F would take the fourteenth seat. The quotient for party A would be 4.56, after six seats, and the quotient for party B would be 4.5 after four seats. Let us suppose that, while F and G swap preferences, they mainly put party A before party B. In these circumstances, the combined vote for the three Independents would be the same as for party A. However, under this system party A gets nine seats, the Independents three seats and all the other votes are wasted. The same votes will end up giving one set of people nine seats and the other set of people three seats. I am not going to accept that, having fought against such a situation in Queensland all my life. I will not actually vote for a Bill that seeks to impose that on the national capital of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going on here in terms of this amendment is the essential fallacy of the problem of trying to introduce this preferential system into the d'Hondt system without rewriting it from top to bottom. If possible, I would like the Minister to give an explanation in relation to the following example pertaining to the ACT. I shall take the 1974 example quite purposefully, because, in fact, that was one of the low periods for the Labor Party, and I presume that the Labor Party will accept that there may be low periods again at some time in the future. In that election the Labor Party got 24 per cent of the vote and four seats, the Liberal Party of Australia got 34 per cent of the vote and seven seats, the Australia Party got two seats, and the Independents got five seats. This type of example is not fanciful. This example is very close to the sorts of voting figures that have occurred in the ACT. I remind the Minister that, in relation to the last Senate vote, of all the States and Territories, other than Tasmania, the ACT is the least likely to use the party system. In other words, people are committed to moving themselves around. Secondly, in the previous Assembly there have always been Independents and minority teams. Can the Minister say what provision has been made under proposed clause 18 (3) for the possibility that, after this exclusion has taken place, there might be fewer candidates available for election than the number of vacancies to be filled? How would that work? Can the Minister indicate where in the Bill there is a provision that prevents our ending up, by going through a series of exclusions, required by proposed clause 18 (3), with not having enough people to fill the 17 seats?</PARA>

I should refer again to what I said at the end of the second reading debate-that is, that this system was not the first preference or the second preference of the Government. It came about after a long period of negotiation with the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. The reality is that in a chamber like this no-one has a majority to impose the system that he may seek. If one regards the granting of self-government to the ACT as important, one must negotiate a workable system. The system might not be exactly what the Government or the Opposition wants, but this process delivers a system that is workable in the first place and, most importantly, it makes sure that self-government is achieved and that we are not side-tracked or stopped. That is the point from which both the Opposition and the Government proceeded in these negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin gave a number of examples, and I will respond to just a few of them. One cannot equate the situation in relation to upper Houses around the country with the situation in relation to the ACT Legislative Assembly. The fact is that executive government has the confidence of the people's House in every State in the Commonwealth. I hope that situation will apply here in the ACT. Certainly, it would have to apply in the election of the Chief Minister, which would be done by the members of the Assembly in the same way as the House of Representatives and the Senate would elect their Speaker and President. The reality is that in every State of Australia the executive government is entitled to expect the confidence of the people's House, and that is what we are going to get here. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin gave the example of the 1974 ACT Assembly elections. I have the final polling booth count figures for that election. I will be happy to make those figures available to the honourable senator, but they do not correspond with the ones that he provided earlier. However, I do not think that that negates the honourable senator's argument; it just means that the figures given were not right. </PARA>

It is also obvious that, had the system been applied in the election referred to, other candidates would not have been dragged in, and the votes, as the honourable senator put it, would have been wasted once they had been elected. Because of the system that applied, there was no point in running other candidates. The whole point of the proposed system is to ensure that this happens. Any Independent running in the election in the ACT who believes that he or she has significant support will certainly run another candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let us say that, for whatever reason, they do not do that-perhaps a person may think that he is so talented, as so many people in the ACT think they are, that he will not find anyone good enough to run with him-and votes are wasted. It is still not the case that in some way we might finish up not being able to elect 17 members. The facts are that the casual vacancy provisions then come into play, and we can still fill the 17 seats. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how Senator Macklin could make the claims that he has made. I also do not understand how he can talk about fallacy. It seems to me that the whole speech that he just made was based on that fundamental fallacy of equating this situation with what applies to upper Houses, when the reality is that the executive government is entitled to the confidence of the people's House-and, in this case, it is a people's House that we are seeking to elect. I repeat: I do not regard this system as perfect. However, I do regard it as adequate and workable. It works all around the world, and there is no reason to suggest that it cannot work in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer again to the figures that I gave for the 1974 election. I will be very interested if the Minister has different figures. The figures that I have indicate that the Australian Labor Party got 24.28 per cent of the vote and that the Liberals got 33.69 per cent. In fact, I do not have the figures for the Australia Party votes or the Independent votes. However, it was the two major party groups that I was relying upon, because candidates outside both of those groups received 42.11 per cent of the vote. I would be very surprised if the Minister had got some other figures. I would be interested to know where he got those from. The Minister did not in fact answer my question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I get to that, I can hardly see what the Minister is getting at when referring to the analogy that I was drawing with regard to the Executive Government. As well as the two States where provisions with regard to the upper House and the Budget are different from what they are here, this chamber is quite capable of destroying any government-and has done so in the past. I really do not see what the Minister's point is. My point was the relationship between the Parliament and the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the analogy that I drew, which the Minister interestingly enough did not dissociate himself from; that is, that this is awfully close to the Queensland system, a one-chamber parliament which is rorted. The question that I asked the Minister at the end was: What provision has been made in the Bill for the possibility that fewer candidates are available for election, after the exclusion in 18 (3) takes place, than there are vacancies to be filled?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin has once again likened this system to the Queensland system. He referred to there being a rort in Queensland and a rort here. He reminded me of something that I said about five years ago-that one should not try to invent a system to suit oneself, because it might suit one this year but not next year. The facts are that the Government is not looking for a system to suit it this year, next year or any other year; it is looking for a workable system to develop self-government-and that, I believe, is something it has delivered. Senator Macklin well knows-in fact, better than I-that the rort in Queensland is the gerrymander. It is not the system of counting; it is the gerrymander. By introducing the system which I hope this chamber will pass tonight, I think we are making the system immune from gerrymander. It is going to be virtually impossible to fiddle with the system. If we are looking for certainty, for a system that has an inbuilt integrity because of that certainty, that is what this system will deliver. I thought that is what we ought to be all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to Senator Macklin's query on the figures, I am quite happy to have an attendant take this document to him so he can look at it. As I said, I do not use the discrepancy in the figures as any reason to interrupt the debate, because we could still have the debate on the principles of the figures he has given us. I think at the end of his speech-although I was distracted-he referred once again to the possibility of finishing up with not enough candidates to fill the 17 seats. I referred to a `casual vacancy' in what might be called a generic sense. What we are talking about here is that, if we did not have enough candidates elected, section 181 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, as modified in its application to the ACT, would provide for a supplementary election to be held. I believe, by the way, that the possibility of there not being enough candidates elected is something like that system I was shown today, with 20 candidates each with five per cent of the vote. The chances of this happening are billions to one and it is just not worth taking up the chamber's time discussing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in the method that is proposed to be used in this system. Despite the fact that we would have 17 or more candidates standing, it is proposed that we take out more, rather than leave 17, and then have another election down the road to fix up that exercise. That is the most extraordinary proposal for any electoral system that I have ever come across.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not necessarily a billion to one chance of it happening. With a slight modification of the figures taken in 1974, it in fact actually does arise. The reason I read out what happened in 1983 is that it struck a bell in my mind. I went back to that particular debate. This is remarkably similar to that exercise and it could be fixed up by saying that, if along the way the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of remaining unfilled vacancies, those candidates should then automatically be declared elected, and that is the election. That is a very simple procedure to put in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's suggested procedure is to continue to eliminate candidates until we get down to 15 or 16, to get those elected, and then to have another election to get the extra place. That is an incredible proposition for a system. There is a much simpler way of dealing with that item: if on the way we get down to 17 and we have 17 vacancies, then those 17 vacancies are filled. I cannot see why anyone would not have that catch-all phrase there, as we included in the Senate count for precisely the same reason-that we could have got down to the point on the elimination of having fewer candidates than there were places that needed to be filled; and hence we would find ourselves operating those other parts in the Electoral Act to which the Minister has drawn attention. Why not put the same provision in here? It seems to me extraordinary that we should go that particular way. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with this area is that quota preferential elections avoid these problems in the normal course of events by giving precedence to the election of candidates who have enough votes to be certain of success, no matter what happens. This problem arises from trying to marry this preference system with the pure d'Hondt system in a way that is not used by any other country. Although there are plenty of modified d'Hondt systems operating this exercise is not tried, because exclusions up front seem to introduce greater vote wastage and, I would suggest, remove control over the orderly process by which the system is able to fill the vacancies which are available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is intending to proceed on that line, I do not suppose there is much that can be done. But I would have thought that the simpler, more straightforward catch-all method would have been the one to use rather than having the possibility remaining of a number of stages in the election. It is quite possible, under some unforeseen circumstances such as a spray of votes, for a number of candidates not to be elected under one particular organisation. But then again, I think Senator Richardson would have scoffed at the idea, as I would have, of somebody in New South Wales being elected to the Senate with just a little over one per cent of the vote to start with. It is an occurrence which is highly unlikely under the Senate counting system, but it did occur. The problem is that these things can occur in the system, and they could have been eliminated by the legislation actually having the catch-all phrases to deal with those particular items that may occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what we have got overall on 18 (3) are some worrying items, because we could end up with not simply one or two elections but in fact a series of elections if at the end of the day we had some strong Independents running, which is not unusual in the circumstances that we are looking at. While the Northern Territory has not fostered independents, I would suggest-and I am sure Senator Ray knows the political situation there as well as I do, if not better-that many of those people who run under party tickets have in fact gained their positions virtually as Independents in those electorates despite being adopted by political parties. If the political parties had not adopted them, they would have run anyway and probably won. I think that the compact type of electorate that we have in the Australian Capital Territory could mean in fact that we run down that path. I am not saying that it will mean that, but I am saying that it could. I believe that we should always write our electoral laws to take care of all eventualities. That is what we have done at the Commonwealth level to date. I would have hoped that it would be a tradition that we would continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to answer every point Senator Macklin has just raised because I have already answered most of them before. Unfortunately Senator Macklin does not accept what I have had to say on all those points. I will take up a couple of the things he has just said. Firstly, up-front exclusions are hardly rare. If we look at a 5 per cent exclusion figure in West Germany or Sweden we see that democracy seems to work reasonably well. If we look at Israel, where that exclusion does not apply at all, we have the spectacle of Mr Shamir running around all the ultra religious parties for three weeks after the election and still being unable, on the basis of the last information I read, to come up with a majority. That is because people with very small votes very often get elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin referred to Senator Robert Wood's election in New South Wales on such a small vote. I have to say that it was not an election that I welcomed. It was not even an election that I would have thought likely. But having said that, it was always possible; it was always something that, in the preparation of any model that one wanted to do for an election one could see how it could occur. Therefore, naturally one would allow for that. What Senator Macklin really is suggesting here, the crux of the argument, that in some way we will not get 17 people elected in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)-comparing it to the same likelihood of someone with Senator Wood's vote getting elected-really is ridiculous. There is no comparison whatsoever between those two circumstances. The odds are totally different. </PARA>
<PARA> I look at Senator Macklin's arguments. I would have thought that there is even less chance of only 10 people nominating in New South Wales for election to the Senate next time, thus leaving a couple of vacancies to fill, than there is of our having not enough people elected in the ACT in either its first or subsequent elections. The facts are that Senator Macklin is talking up a ridiculously improbable chance on the basis really that this whole system does not fit in with Australian Democrat self-interest. That really is the crux of this. That is what it is about. It is about whether the Australian Democrats get a system that suits them. Yet, Senator Macklin has been standing there accusing me of trying to devise a system that suits the Australian Labor Party. As I have said, the facts are that this is not the Labor Party's first choice. However, it is not a system that is rorted. It is a system that provides an adequate, workable compromise and delivers self-government to the ACT. That, I hope, is what everyone in the chamber is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree totally with the Minister. The term `next available preference' is very clear in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In fact, I said that there is no problem with it in the Senate's scrutiny. However, I think there is an ambiguity here. I was seeking some clarification as to which of the two possibilities might apply. Unless this is clearly defined, I am not sure that the Australian Electoral Commission will be able to carry out the instructions. Are we talking about provisionally elected candidates only? If so, what is the point of having provisionally elected candidates? Are they actually to be elected? As to the term `next available preference' as far as I can see, nothing has been suggested in the legislation that candidates who are not provisionally elected are to be treated in any specific way in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I can spell out what I see as a problem. If the next available preference is to be available only to those who are provisionally elected, what is the relevance of that exercise? Will the candidates not excluded under proposed new clause 18 (3)-the ones the Minister has indicated that they will not necessarily be elected-be the recipients of the next available preference? Is that to be the total group?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this general question of the next available preference, all the legal advice that we have received from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel suggests that there is no difficulty with the translation of the term `next available preference' from the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I would have thought that was a much better assurance than mine, because all of those people who make a living out of knowing suggest that there is no problem. Obviously the provisional election concept takes into account amendments suggested by Senator Hill. While the Government, as I said earlier, may not regard that as perfect or ideal, it is nonetheless workable. However, the difficulty is that if Senator Macklin simply does not approve-and he obviously does not approve; I do not think he needs to ask us to note it as we got the message-he is continuing to ask the same questions about next available preference and provisional election. I am continuing to give the same answers. I do not really believe-and I have thought about it carefully in the last few minutes-that there is anything useful I can add beyond that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know that the next available preference is not actually delineated to those provisionally elected but is able to be distributed to all those not excluded. That presumably means to all those candidates of the party. For the life of me I do not see what the rationale could be for taking votes away from candidates where the voter most strongly supports moving them to where there are less. That is a matter of the philosophy of the actual operation itself. I move to proposed new clause 19c (4). It is part of the amendment that the Minister has moved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am looking at 19c (4) where we get quotients on different ranks. They are equal. The quotient on the higher rank should be taken to be the higher quotient. That could be important if we are dealing with the last place. If there were places prior to that the subsequent exercise might not make all that much difference. If we are dealing with an exercise here it seems to me that we would have several possibilities. On the higher rank one of the major parties may have had a number of seats previously gained and have left over a relatively small percentage of the vote, whereas a smaller group may have gained one seat and have a larger percentage left over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am wondering whether the Minister sees that as a possibility. If he does what is the rationale that the Government had in mind for breaking the particular problem we have here? I acknowledge that under the counting system there is a problem because we have to choose one or another. Why did the Government choose the higher rank? Is there any particular reason to choose the higher rank rather than the other, given the fact that the quotients are equal at that particular point?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the d'Hondt system the reason we choose the higher rank is that that is where the most number of votes are recorded in the first place. As I understand it, that is what it is supposed to be. I do not understand how the d'Hondt system is worked any other way. Part of what Senator Macklin was suggesting has nothing to do with this part of the count of the different ranks. If we do not have this method then the system is not workable. It is the only possible way it can work. We really do have a problem of communication.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that there needs to be a system for breaking the exercise. This is fairly obvious when we actually get into a count context. The point I was trying to make relates to the philosophy behind it. Certainly, I accept that the higher rank obviously is, by definition, the one with the most votes. It may also be satisfied by more seats. I was thinking particularly of the last exercise, when we are looking for the last seat, and why would it go there rather than to the other group? Is that just simply the arbitrary way of doing it? The likelihood of it arising is anybody's guess but if it did arise it could well be the determining factor in the overall composition of the Assembly-taking that extra seat from one spot to another. Is there any particular reason for this, other than to reflect that it is moving where most of the other seats have moved rather than moving to where the other percentages may suggest in terms of votes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not suggesting any method. I was trying to elucidate the thought the Government had behind taking it in one way rather than the other. Obviously the thought is to move the seat to the number which had gained the highest number of seats, thereby enhancing the chance that there would be a majority. I presume that was the philosophy behind the exercise-in other words, giving the extra impetus that could possibly arise in the circumstances. In terms of the proposed subclauses 19c (7) and (8), the point I want to raise is not so much the one dealing with the numbers but I again express the Australian Democrats' concern, particularly with subclause (8), where there is an independent candidate. In looking at some of the past exercises around Australia I looked at the one that Senator Harradine was involved in during the Tasmanian election in 1980. He gained 21 per cent of the vote and did not have a running mate. Senator Harradine is an extant example so I cannot be accused of actually thinking up fanciful examples. It is quite possible that some such person might emerge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taking into account the number of votes that will be needed for the counting exercise, certainly the number will not be very much more than five, even acknowledging the point that somehow one could get the quota and still not get a seat. That will mean that something like 16 per cent of the votes `shall be disregarded'. It is an extraordinary system which would disregard 16 per cent of the vote. The party system will enable that exercise to continue because further candidates are available within the party structure. However, such an outcome will not result from the exercise that I have suggested involving Senator Harradine. I think it is a pity that we would alight on a system that has that possibility built within it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory has shown that it is likely to favour a number of independent candidates. I hoped that we may have actually come up with a system which would have been more sympathetic to that possibility, particularly in the case of a number of independent candidates who, for whatever reason, may wish to run on their own. The advice that the Minister would want to give to any person thinking of doing that is probably the advice Senator Harradine took of actually having another person running for election with him. I think it is a pity that we still come up with such a system-I do not know why Senator Harradine did not run with a candidate in 1980; it may be that he did not want to-under which a high profile person would be able to disadvantage people who vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, Senator Macklin himself gave the answer when he said that Senator Harradine ran with someone else the next time and the time thereafter. The system which we are advocating tonight in fact encourages independents to make sure that they run with a party partner. But if they do not-that is obviously a choice that they can make-then Senator Macklin is right; a large number of votes are wasted. But what is new or unusual about that? It happens every day in the House of Representatives. Every time there is an election votes can be wasted. There is nothing unusual or new about that, but there has to be a system that delivers a result. If an independent were to choose to run on his own, what Senator Macklin says is right. But this will not affect the end result. We have made sure that there is a system in place to take account of that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The d'Hondt is a proportional system. When one reads about the d'Hondt system-I will quote from a history on electoral systems-one finds it is criticised because it favours the largest parties and `does not ensure that the seats which are allocated to parties are proportional to the votes which they have gained'. This is really what a lot of this argument has been about. There are figures everywhere that prove just that.

I did quote in debate yesterday the resolution of the Australian Labor Party which states quite categorically that the Labor Party's policy is in favour of a proportional and preferential system. Mr N. A. Brown, the shadow Attorney-General in the other place, is also on record during the ACT self-government debate as saying that the Liberal Party favours a proportional preferential system and that is why he is not in favour of the d'Hondt system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have amendments to clause 18, which I intend to move on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I am not sure how I stand as the Government has moved to deal with clause 18 and clause 19 at the same time. The Committee has to decide whether it will be in favour of a proportional system, which is also preferential, which will allow an Assembly to have reflected in its various composition the proportions of the votes received by various candidates. For the life of me, I really cannot understand why both major parties here seem to be afraid to have candidates who reflect a sizeable vote, albeit a minority vote, and an opinion which is not of the majority parties. I cannot for the life of me understand why the two major parties here seem to be afraid to have those candidates sit within the Assembly. Surely it would be much better to have opinions, which are held in the community, actually reflected in the Assembly. Those opinions can then be put in the Assembly. This is preferable to those views being covered up and having to rely on groups outside the Parliament to express them. I would not have thought that this Senate, which is elected by the Senate-style fully proportional preferential system, wants to deny that favour to the people of the ACT. </PARA>

In fact, in the Government's own amendments, already passed, it has stated that it prefers an optional preferential form of voting. In this way people who wish to vote for only their own Party and for one or two other lists or candidates can do this. People who wish to vote right across the board can do this. Parties that wish to lodge a card with the Electoral Office with only part of the preferences filled in can do this. But the count would be a Senate-style count. Preferences that have been put on tickets would be counted and duly assigned. I put to the Committee that this is a much fairer, a more just and a more democratic voting system than the d'Hondt system.

<PARA>The reason for this amendment is that it looks as if the people of the Australian Capital Territory are going to have the d'Hondt system for their first election. What we suggest in the interests of democracy is that during the term of that first Assembly a referendum should be held concerning electoral systems. During this period the people of the ACT would have the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the d'Hondt system and the results of it. They have had other systems in the past. Their previous Assembly was a straight Senate-style system. Therefore, we suggest that the systems to go to a referendum of the people of the ACT should be the system provided by this Act; any other electoral system agreed to by the Assembly; the election of members of electoral divisions based on discrete communities, which was the Australian Democrats' preferred option circulated in my draft Bill last May; an electoral system similar to that by which senators are elected for the Territory; another electoral system, if any, preferred by the Labor Party; another electoral system, if any, preferred by the Liberal Party; and any other electoral system, if any, which the Assembly is satisfied has substantial community support in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In this way, and if the votes were to be taken on preferential count, the people of the ACT would then have a say in their electoral system because, as was said earlier in the debate today and yesterday, in a sense we are in a catch-22 situation: we are saying that the people of the ACT should have their own Assembly but we must impose certain measures on them while we can give them a choice in certain others. This is one way that we could do that. I hope that, as the Government and the Opposition have their way with the d'Hondt system, they will support this referendum proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment of Senator Jenkins. Quite some time ago when the whole issue of an Australian Capital Territory government was first raised the contentious issue between the political parties was undoubtedly the electoral system that would have to be provided. The first time around it proved insurmountable, but that is not so on this occasion. However, it was interesting that on that first occasion the Minister said that unless the electoral system that was then proposed was adopted-and the reason no change could be made-it would delay self-government. That was over a couple of years ago. There are two ways of giving the people of the ACT a final say in the system of government which is to govern them: firstly, we can allow the Assembly to operate in such a way that it is able to change its electoral base-as, for example, any State government is permitted to do; or, secondly, we can simply say that at some time in the next three years the people of the ACT will have the opportunity to affirm the system that is installed-and they will have seen it operating-or some other system. I think that most of the systems that they will be asked to vote on will be those that they have seen in operation either in the ACT, such as proportional representation, or at the Federal level with the preferential system, single member electorates or whatever. In other words, the people of the ACT are given a final say as to the system that will govern them from thereon in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The adoption of this proposal will in no way affect the operation or timing of self-government and it will not affect the first election-the system that has been agreed to by the Government and the Opposition. However, it would mean that it would go back to the people themselves to reaffirm that that is the system that they want, or they could say that they want some other system. I think that that basic right should be given to the people of the Territory. We have tried to set up a proposal that would allow each of the major contending systems to be introduced. For example, one choice might be what is called in the ACT the Mackerras system, but there are a number of proposals that float around. I believe that they can compete on their merits and that the people of the ACT would then have the final say as to the system that should govern them from then on. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other option if that is not acceptable is to give them a system that allows them to change their electoral system at will. The Government seems unwilling to go down that track, but surely it must be happy to accept the final verdict of the people with respect to the system that will govern the Territory rather than have the Federal Government impose it on them after the thing is up and running. We have always acknowledged the need to get the thing up and running. It has foundered on the electoral system, but that will no longer be the case. We make an appeal that the people of the ACT be allowed to contribute to the exercise. Indeed, our first submission to the Government a number of years ago when this was first raised was that the simplest, cleanest and most democratic way of dealing with this issue was to ask the people of the ACT what system they wanted and surely, once they had chosen their system, it could not be a matter of contention. </PARA>
<PARA> We have suggested these items here. Obviously a number of items will have to operate on a preferential system of voting. It will be the system most preferred by the people of the ACT which will become their system. I believe that that is a fair and reasonable approach and, if it is adopted, I think it would solve many of the problems that may arise over the next year or so when people still wish to contend around the electoral system. It may be a political argument, but I thought that it should be addressed, that there is a vast number of issues for the ACT which should be the subject of an election campaign rather than the issue of the electoral system itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Including the referendum proposal I think would defuse that political campaign and would remove it to a time on its own. It would be an item whereby the first territorial election, hopefully, would surround issues of concern to the Territory instead of having to linger on the contentious issue of whether or not the electoral system was the one that they wanted themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously we accept the determination that Parliament can make on this. It has made it. That will be the system that operates for the first election. I appeal to both the Government and the Opposition to allow the people of the Territory themselves to have a say in what happens after that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. What the Minister has just said about a referendum is not totally relevant because the Assembly will be voted in under the d'Hondt system. The people who sit on the Assembly will have been voted in under that system. Therefore, it is appropriate for us, who are setting up that system, also to make provision within the Act which sets up that system so that the people of the Australian Capital Territory will be sure of having a referendum, that it will not depend on the people elected under the d'Hondt system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposing these amendments. It is consistent with the approach we have taken on other amendments. A step by step approach is the sensible way to proceed. No doubt, this Federal Government and Federal Parliament will be looking at the results of the first election under the new d'Hondt system unique to Australia, a system which we are approaching optimistically. If a response is necessary, no doubt a response will be made. We hope that the day will come when this self-governing body will control its total electoral affairs, including the electoral system. We also hope that other provisions of the Act and powers might be transferred in years ahead. It is our view that the Assembly should first be set up and we should see how it is operating. The operation of this Act should be seen before that decision is taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

My amendment No. (8) seeks to insert a provision which has been urged by many Australian Capital Territory citizens who are experienced in planning matters. The Australian Democrats believe that the provision will require an essential public process in local matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As to amendment No. (9), a lack of formality is desirable. Nevertheless, it must be clear that this cannot be taken to mean that informality can be exercised at the expense of public involvement. My amendment No. (10), which relates to paragraph 29 (2) (b) in the Bill, is allied to amendment No. (9). Amendments Nos (11) and (12) address a very important matter in obtaining fairness in public processes. They also address the practical problems which have been experienced in the Australian Capital Territory. It is clear that people should know directly what is involved in a proposed variation, and this should not be obscured by technical language. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, amendments Nos (13) and (14) relate to the remarks that I made previously. Finally, amendments Nos (15) and (16) contain the new provisions that I proposed in my amendment No. (6). I must say that it is very disappointing that apparently neither the Government nor the Opposition has chosen to lend support to any of these amendments which, as I said before, the Australian Democrats believe would greatly enhance this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) presented to the Parliament today the most dishonest and deliberately misleading report from a government agency to come before this Parliament in my 13 years in this place. It is the glossiest and most costly of reports-and totally unnecessarily so-which seeks to hide the disastrous results of the Trust in the 12 months to June behind a facade of pretty pictures and irrelevant prose. It is only by a close, detailed examination of the accounts printed at the back of the annual report that the extent of the disastrous year for the Trust, and the retired public servants whose money it has, is revealed, because the printed report does not do so. On the contrary, it seeks dishonestly to hide it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report does not reveal that the Trust suffered an incredible turnaround in equity earnings of more than half a billion dollars in the year to June 1988-$530m to be precise-from the 1987 profit of $344m to a loss of $187m. The report does not admit that total income dropped from $918m to $730m and would have fallen by a further $154m but for an abnormal item, which was the gain on revaluation of property that emerged because the Trust sacked its cautious and conservative government valuers, the Australian Valuation Office, and got some independent commercial valuers to provide it with a hugely boosted valuation which saved the Trust from a fall of $340m in net income. </PARA>

<PARA> SENATE 24-25 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA>24-25 November 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> The annual report does not disclose that the compound rate of return for the Fund was more than cut in half to 13.4 per cent from 1987's 27.3 per cent, nor does it reveal or explain how management costs jumped by 60 per cent to $11.7m, or that the amount available for allocation to contributors was slashed by $288m, or by 35 per cent, to $514m, or that it had made a loss on equity investments offshore-as this government agency decided it would invest its money offshore-of $66.3m. On top of that, having lost that money, it has now decided to spend another $200m, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a strategy of increasing exposure to offshore equities markets was pursued and the Trust approved an allocation of $A200 million to a global-indexed pooled fund. </PARA>
<PARA>This report goes on and on, and is a disaster from beginning to end. The intriguing part is that none of the disasters are admitted in the written report which came to this Parliament, which is signed by Mr L. J. Willett and which was received by Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance. I want to know what the Minister for Finance has done about this deceptive and dishonest report. I am intrigued by the fact that the Minister for Finance has done nothing about the wasteful, incompetent and deceptive nature of this report. This report has used, in its printing, the most expensive and glossy typographical devices I have ever seen, as if they were photographic reproductions of the highest quality. The cost must have been enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole report is, I believe, a total disgrace. I pointed out that, according to last year's report, the Trust's investments seemed heavily concentrated on what I think is now described as part of Western Australia Incorporated. I read in last year's report that it had 11.1 million shares in the Bell Group, two million shares in Bell Resources, with 5.9 million preference shares-and so it goes on. I raised a question on this with the Minister for Finance last year. I asked him what sorts of loses the Fund had suffered in the share market crash last year as a result of its extraordinary concentration of shares in the Bell Group. At that stage that was Mr Holmes a Court's Bell Group, before it was merged into other parts of WA Inc. The Minister for Finance on 18 December 1987 admitted that from that one single set of investments WA Inc. had lost approximately $86m. Of course, since then what has happened to WA Inc.?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed so. All I have to say on this matter is that it is now incredible that this crooked report has excluded this year its list of investments so that one does not in fact have the opportunity to find out what its exposure to WA Inc. is this year. The report has gone from massive detail, boring perhaps as it may be to many people-but detail which revealed its curious investment policy last year-to the glossy document which does not provide the information but which in fact hides information that should, and must be, made available. To my mind it is absolutely disgraceful that the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, having been criticised for some of its investments last year, has chosen not to print the sort of information it printed last year. More disgraceful than that is the fact that it has set out to mislead those people who benefit or otherwise from the activities of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. For example, the Chairman's report says about the Trust's results for the year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the volatile market conditions during 1987-88, SFIT achieved a return of 13.4 per cent, making it one of the top performing funds according to the published market surveys. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not reveal that that involves a cutting in half of its return for the previous year. The report goes on to talk about its investment performance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the obvious negative impact of the sharemarket crash on equities, investment in other sectors enabled SFIT to achieve a commendable return for the year . . . </PARA>

<PARA> SENATE 24-25 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA>24-25 November 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA>There is no admission that its return had fallen by so much-that the amount available to contributors had in fact fallen by $288m. As I said, one has to find the facts by looking at the detailed document of the audited accounts at the end of the report. There is nothing about this in the printed report which went to the Minister, and about which the Minister has made no complaint whatsoever. This report made to him is simply deceptive and misleading. I think it is a measure of this Minister's incompetence that, having been put on notice last year by my questions about the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, he has been prepared to accept the report, to table it without comment in this place and, by the way, ensure that it was right at the bottom of the list of reports tabled today so that there would be no opportunity to discuss it when it should properly have been discussed during the tabling of reports. I must say that I believe that this disgraceful performance both by the SFIT and by the Minister, whose indolence in regard to this matter this year equals his indolence in regard to it last year, should properly be brought to the attention not only of the Senate but of the Australian people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Commonwealth is responsible for management of only a limited number of national parks. Generally, responsibility for management of national parks in Australia lies primarily with the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Advice on the programs was sought from the relevant agencies whose advice is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth National Parks</PARA>
<PARA>Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) is responsible for managing Kakadu, Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga), Christmas Island and Norfolk Island National Parks. As part of the ANPWS wildlife management strategy, feral animal control programs are carried out in all parks.</PARA>
<PARA> Specific programs include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Goats-There are no feral goats in national parks managed by the ANPWS.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Pigs-In Kakadu National Park there are substantial feral pig populations in some areas and opportunistic shooting is carried out by park staff. A commercial live capture program is also being trialled.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Cats-Feral cats occur in all the national parks managed by the ANWPS. Opportunistic shooting is undertaken in Kakadu and Christmas Island National Parks, while feral cat numbers are controlled by trapping in Norfolk Island National Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rabbits-An extensive rabbit control program is carried out at Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park and involves poisoning, gassing and destruction of burrows.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, after a seven year program, rabbits were eradicated from Philip Island, a 190 hectare island near Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Donkeys-A small population of feral donkeys, found in Kakadu National Park, was recently shot.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Buffalo-A major buffalo control program has been operating in Kakadu National Park for the past eight years. Since 1980 in excess of 29,000 buffalo have been removed from the Park by commercial shooters, using live capture and shooting, and by park staff by shooting.</PARA>
<PARA> Control of buffalo will continue in accordance with the Kakadu National Park plan of management and the requirements of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Camels-Camels are found in Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park, however they are not considered a major problem at this time and no control program has been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Other-In Norfolk Island National Park, introduced rats and the introduced crimson rosellas are a problem for native wildlife. Poisoned baits and traps are used to control rats while the crimson rosellas are removed by shooting.</PARA>
<PARA>ACT Parks and Conservation Service</PARA>
<PARA>Namadgi National Park</PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Capital Territory the ACT Parks and Conservation Service is responsible for the management of Namadgi National Park. The Service funds, plans and executes all feral animal control programs in accordance with the Namadgi National Park management plan. The objectives of this program are:</PARA>
<PARA> to achieve effective control over introduced species;</PARA>
<PARA> to reduce the impact of introduced species already within the Park;</PARA>
<PARA> to restrict any further introductions of species into the Park; and</PARA>
<PARA>to minimise the susceptibility of park environments to invasion by introduced species.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Goats-Feral goats are controlled by shooting. In 1987 nearly 100 feral goats were shot in Namadgi National Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Pigs-Feral pigs are controlled by using poison bait. Where poisoning is not appropriate traps are used. The poisoning program is believed to control up to 90% of feral pigs in a given area during the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Cats-Feral cats are shot by rangers.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rabbits-An extensive program is being implemented to control rabbits. A variety of methods are being used including:</PARA>
<PARA> Destruction of burrows;</PARA>
<PARA> gassing; and</PARA>
<PARA> reintroduction of myxomatosis virus.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) (vi) and (vii) donkeys, buffalo, camels-There are no feral donkeys, buffalo or camels in Namadgi National Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Other feral animals include horses, cattle, foxes and wild dogs. Feral horses, cattle and foxes are shot by park staff. A system of tracking feral cattle by radio transmitters has been used successfully. Wild dogs are trapped within 1 km inside the park boundary following reports of lost or killed sheep or domestic livestock.</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management</PARA>
<PARA> This Department has active programs of control of feral animals on national parks, nature reserves and state forests, although the degree of control that can be achieved is constrained by staff and financial resources. Examples of areas to which priority attention is directed are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> eradication of feral animals (e.g. rats, goats) from island nature reserves where endangered native species are at risk;</PARA>
<PARA> measures to prevent introduction of feral animals to island nature reserves;</PARA>
<PARA> control of foxes in a number of parks and reserves where endangered native species are at risk from fox predation;</PARA>
<PARA> control of introduced herbivores causing environmental degradation-e.g. cattle and donkeys at Bungle Bungle National Park; feral goats at Kalbarri and Cape Range National Parks; rabbits in many parks and reserves;</PARA>
<PARA> pig control in Kalbarri National Park and the south-west of the State.</PARA>
<PARA>South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Goats-Regular Programs in Gammon Ranges National Park and Danggali Conservation Park. Programs time to time in Ngarkat Conservation Park and Para Wirra Recreation Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Pigs-Programs in Flinders Chase National Park (Kangaroo Island) and the reserves of the Murray River.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Cats-Nil</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rabbits-site specific programs e.g. Wilpena area of Flinders Ranges National Park and other specific areas but problem regarded as beyond control.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Donkeys-Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Buffalo-Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Camels-not considered a problem although frequent incidence in north-east desert parks.</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland National Parks</PARA>
<PARA>and Wildlife Service</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service undertakes control or eradication programs of feral animals on mainland and island national parks as opportunities present themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> The programs have been developed over many years, with considerable assistance from the Stock Routes and Rural Lands Protection Board in Queensland. The success rate has been greater with the island national parks due to both the size of the parks and the reduced risk of reinfestation by pest animals. Humane methods are used at all times.</PARA>
<PARA>Conservation Commission of the</PARA>
<PARA>Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA> The Conservation Commission is the authority responsible in the Northern Territory for co-ordination of feral animal control programs under the advice of the Feral Animals Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Specific programs in place regarding feral animal control on national parks are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Goats-No park control program. There are currently no feral goats in Northern Territory parks.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Pigs-Opportunistic shooting in areas of highest concentration. Research is planned to determine most appropriate methods to effect pig control over broad areas, particularly the wetlands.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Cats-Opportunistic shooting and trapping in areas of highest concentration.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rabbits-Warren ripping and fumigation undertaken in worst affected areas. The Commission is supporting biological control work being undertaken by South Australia to find a suitable vector for control in arid areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Donkeys-Extensive shooting program in the Victoria River District conducted by rangers supplemented with supply of ammunition to pastoralists. Escalated program proposed for 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Buffalo-Eradication of feral buffalo from all parks and reserves currently under way under the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC) due for completion December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Camels-No formal program. Camels at present are not a major feral problem on parks and reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Horses-Shooting is undertaken in conjunction with the BTEC on parks and reserves in the Top End. In Central Australia, mustering and shooting is undertaken where populations are at high levels. A program aimed at removing feral horses from Central Australian reserves is being developed in conjunction with management programs on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Conservation Commission has programs in place to control populations of buffalo, donkeys and horses on parks; is conducting research to form the basis for control programs for rabbits and pigs; and currently has no formal programs for cats, camels or goats.</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian Department of Lands,</PARA>
<PARA>Parks and Wildlife</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Goats-Small herds of feral goats occur scattered around Tasmania. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to shoot out a herd in the Mount William National Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Pigs-Feral pigs only occur on Flinders Island where they are subject to periodic control using shooting and trapping in Strzelecki National Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Cats-Feral cats are ubiquitous in Tasmania, a substantial problem in many reserves and, given available techniques, beyond control in most national parks. Control programs are in place and proving effective in Macquarie Island Nature Reserve and several smaller island reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rabbits-Rabbits are widespread but only occur in problematic numbers in Asbestos Range National Park on mainland Tasmania. They are subject to limited shooting control in this area. Myxomatosis has been used to great effect to control rabbits on Macquarie Island.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) (vi) (vii)-Fortunately Tasmania does not suffer feral herds of donkeys, buffalo or camels.</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service</PARA>
<PARA> Feral vertebrate pests and their control in national parks is a major issue for the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Species of principal concern are rabbits, pigs, goats, cats, wild dogs and foxes; of lesser concern are hares, wild horses and rusa deer. Because of the natural distribution of these animals, each park has a different set of problems.</PARA>
<PARA> Where pests are present in environmentally sensitive park areas, control or eradication is given as high a priority as resources permit.</PARA>
<PARA> Where species are primarily agricultural pests and a park is acting as a reservoir for them, control is confined to the perimeter of the park and is, in general, considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to effective control and management of pest species on Service lands in the most efficient, economic and environmentally sound manner.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also fund research into alternative methods of control of feral dogs and other pest animals which affect farmers whose properties border national parks.</PARA>
<PARA> The Service is reviewing its feral pest control program and will be appointing a wildlife management officer to develop policies, procedures and field management guidelines for pest species on a statewide basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands</PARA>
<PARA> Habitat modifiers</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria the most significant pest animals in national parks are the species that modify habitats; rabbits, pigs and goats. By far the most potentially damaging species is the rabbit. A statewide program and statewide plan exist to control rabbits on all land, the species being declared vermin. In parks, systematic monitoring and control is done. Generally 1080 is used as a knockdown control to be followed by a sequence of control methods, such as warren destruction and fumigation. Myxoma virus is released when environmental conditions are favourable. Co-operative agreements are sought with adjacent land holders to do collective and simultaneous work on infestations.</PARA>
<PARA> Pigs are present in about 6% of Victoria's national and state parks. Monitoring and trapping programs are applied where the need arises, supplemented by shooting. Remote sensing of pigs from aircraft is being trialled.</PARA>
<PARA> Goats have established in the semi-arid parks, in the north west of the State and in some mountainous parks. A system of radio telemetry (Judas goat tracking technique) with subsequent mustering is employed. Some success has been made with trap yards using water as a lure. Goats are also shot by park staff on an ad hoc basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Brumbies are a potential threat to some alpine parks. Small numbers are removed on an ad hoc basis by authorised brumby-running clubs. A control policy is being investigated.</PARA>
<PARA>Predators</PARA>
<PARA> The carnivorous pest animals are fox, dog and cat. Fox is thought to be the most significant in terms of impact on native wildlife. Control in parks concentrates on protecting specific native species during breeding. The control method used is the buried meat-bait technique using 1080 poison. Foxes are considered to be very well entrenched and eradication is not attempted. Protection of particular indigenous species and breeding sites is the major thrust of fox control. Cats are widespread, but in low numbers, although recognised as a problem, no control program is in place. Control is on an ad hoc basis with shooting and trapping being the methods.</PARA>
<PARA> In parks, dogs are a sporadic problem. The largest problem is domestic dogs in urban parks. Live-trapping is used as the major control measure.</PARA>
<PARA> Dogs are controlled on public land by doggers who can also operate in peripheral areas of the parks. Dogs are snared, poisoned, or shot. Dingoes are recognise as endemic in parks and control of them is focused on protection of farming enterprises. A protection policy limits control of dingoes in core areas of remote parks.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Programs to control the numbers of feral animals where they compete with livestock are administered by the State Vertebrate Pest Control Authorities. They have the objective of minimisation of the agricultural and environmental impact of vertebrate pests and the economic loss associated with an exotic animal disease outbreak.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth contributes by co-ordinating programs and liaising with State authorities through the Vertebrate Pests Committee of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Bureau of Rural Resources in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy conducts a continual review of significant vertebrate pests in Australia, with particular emphasis on their management and control.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also co-ordinating the development and review of contingency plans to respond to exotic animal diseases in wildlife. They are based on exercises and projects jointly funded by the States and the Commonwealth Wild Animal Exotic Disease Preparedness Program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) has been in contact with the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service (QNPWS) regarding ghost bats at Mount Etna. Over the period 1976-78 ANPWS funded a researcher at the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education to undertake a detailed study of the Mt Etna ghost bats. The series of reports describing this research, and noting the importance of several caves at Mt Etna, including `Speaking Tube', to ghost bats, was completed shortly after the researcher joined the QNPWS in 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, in reply to a request from ANPWS for advice on the conservation status of ghost bats in Queensland, the QNPWS indicated that the Mt Etna colony was one of the largest in Queensland and that it was threatened by limestone mining.</PARA>
<PARA> On 20 January 1988 the Queensland Government declared a scientific reserve protecting more than 80 per cent of the caves at Mt Etna. I visited the area on 6 February 1988 and on 20 April 1988 wrote to Mr Muntz, Queensland Minister for the Environment, Conservation and Tourism, expressing concern that two caves excluded from the scientific reserve, namely Speaking Tube and Elephant Hole, are important roost sites for the ghost bat.</PARA>
<PARA> The General Manager of Central Queensland Cement (CQC) wrote to me on 29 August 1988 seeking my assurance that the Government would not take action in relation to Mt Etna without first consulting the Company. This assurance was given without reservation and I was therefore shocked by the action of CQC in destroying Speaking Tube on 2 November 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is little more the Commonwealth can do in relation to this matter I have indicated to the company my concerns for the remaining threatened caves of Mt Etna. I have also asked the recently formed Advisory Committee on Endangered Species to consider the status of the ghost bat at their inaugural meeting set down for 29-30 November 1988 with a view to recommending appropriate action to be pursued by the Endangered Species Unit being established within ANPWS.</PARA>
