<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill proposes a number of very important amendments to the operations of the Family Court and the Opposition will support the Bill in principle. Indeed, it supports the major proposals contained in it. However, the Opposition will propose some amendments which I have asked to be tabled so that they can be considered during the course of the second reading debate. I shall make some further reference to them later in my speech. I should like to speak generally about the problems with the Family Court and the solution, or part solution, which the Government proposes in the Bill. The Family Court was established in the legislation of 1975 known as the Family Law Act and, of course, it was a very important part of the new social and legal experiment which that legislation contained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Family Court commenced business on 5 January 1976. It has therefore been a prominent feature of the Australian legal system for just over 12 years. Unfortunately, the Family Court has not established itself as a superior court which has been recognised by the public or indeed the legal profession in the same way as other superior courts in Australia. I do not believe that the Family Court should be held responsible for that but many people do believe that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court was established as part of the new family law code contained in the Family Law Act 1975, a principal feature of which was the no fault divorce concept. It contained some other major changes in attitude towards the family and the arrangements within the family, both between the parties-the husband and wife-and also in relation to their responsibilities to the children. Some of those concepts have created great problems and have been highly criticised. In the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987 passed by the Parliament at the end of last year some of those problems were addressed; namely, the lack of responsibility by parents for the care and maintenance of their children and the sloughing off of those responsibilities onto the state, onto the taxpayer. They proved to be very great failings of the Family Law Act. There are other major problems still to be addressed. One in particular is the question of matrimonial property, family property, which has been the subject of a recent major report of the Law Reform Commission. I presume we will hear more about this in the Government's response to that report. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not our role today in this debate to be discussing those matters. What we are discussing are amendments to the Act to make the Family Court more effective and hopefully a court of greater standing in the community and within the professional community that is concerned with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Family Court has been blamed by many people for what are not so much the many failings of the Court but rather failings within the Family Law Act itself-and probably more than anything failings of community values and standards which have been to some extent reflected in the Family Law Act. Had the ordinary courts of the land been left with the administration of the Family Law Act or indeed any other legislation which reflected those changes of social and moral values which occurred in the 1960s, and I suppose reached their high point in the 1970s, they would have faced the same problems. Any court administering these laws, any court having to deal with people who have adopted a new set of social and moral values, would have had to grapple with the same problems as the Family Court has had to grapple with. Therefore, I think it is most unfair that the Family Court has been blamed by so many people for failings of laws that we in this Parliament have passed, the breakdown of social and moral values in the community and the lack of responsibility that many parents have been guilty of in these recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court, as I said, was part and parcel of the new Family Law Act in 1975. The concept of family court in Australia was certainly a new one, but it was not a new legal concept. Family courts have been established in other places, notably in the United States and, I believe, at about the same time in Canada. The justification for setting up the Family Court was to have a specialised jurisdiction to deal with the very great and sensitive personal issues that arise in this area of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of having specialised courts is not new. I hear a lot of talk these days by people in the highest levels of the legal profession that somehow all courts ought to be courts of general jurisdiction and that there is something wrong with courts of special jurisdiction. That does not in any way reflect the history of the court system under the common law. There have been many precedents in common law over the centuries for the existence of specialised courts. Certainly, in Australian jurisprudence there has always been a place for specialised courts. In fact, the arbitration system originally was administered by what were called arbitration courts. Therefore, the notion that there should be a special court, a specialised jurisdiction in family law matters, was perfectly reasonable from a jurisprudential point of view. There were very solid practical arguments in favour of it. The Family Court has had some very major achievements to its credit over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion behind the setting up of the Family Court was that the judges would have a special interest and qualifications in, sympathy for and understanding of the work, as opposed to Supreme Court judges. They unfortunately, in many cases, regarded family law work as an irritant and a nuisance and did not really bring to bear the sort of sensitivity and concern which this jurisdiction required. I was a member of the Senate when the legislation was considered and played a role in the debates. Indeed, a committee of the Senate of which I was a member looked at the then Family Law Bill. I do not regret the decision which we took then, which I supported-as did many other senators on this side of the chamber-that there should be a specialised Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major feature of the court was the notion of a helping court-a court to which people would have easy access and in which they could be helped by social workers, known as court counsellors, who would assist them to resolve their problems by negotiation and conciliation. Also, registrars of the court-who are officers of the court at a lower level than that of judges-conduct conferences to try to settle the property and financial problems that arise in marriage breakdown. Therefore, it was considered that judges would be involved only as a last resort-that the need for the ordinary type of formal, adversarial proceedings, with counsel and so forth, would be used only as a last resort. That was the concept behind the establishment of the court and the court has been highly successful in achieving that result because, as I think the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) said in his speech in the other place on this Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill, 94 per cent of the cases that come before the Family Court are resolved by agreement between the parties, either with the assistance of the counsellors or the registrars and no doubt with the co-operation of the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I think the legal profession has been very harshly dealt with in criticism of the Family Court because by and large lawyers who are doing their job do seek to persuade clients to reasonable settlements. I am sure that the practitioners in the Family Court have also carried on that noble tradition of the legal profession, and the result speaks for itself-94 per cent of the cases that go into the Family Court are resolved. What we see are only the difficult cases that the court has to deal with. I suppose that reflects very much the ordinary work of all courts; they are dealing only with the difficult cases or the very difficult people. Let us not underestimate the difficulty created by some of the people involved in these proceedings. Some people will never be persuaded by anybody that they are not absolutely right. They have no capacity whatsoever for negotiating with their former partner in marriage; they are just exceedingly difficult people to deal with. That is ultimately in most cases the problems the courts are having to deal with, the very difficult element in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, overall the court has got some very great achievements to its credit, and within a short space of time. I do not have the time, in this speech, to go over in detail the problems that that court had in being established. When it was set up in early 1976 under the Chief Judgeship of Elizabeth Evatt and a few of the early judges they had the very gravest difficulty in getting premises. They had to get premises all over Australia for this new court. It was because of the volume of work which was suddenly thrust upon it that they had to get premises quickly and, of course, in many cases the premises were most unsatisfactory. I must say that governments of which I was a member and the present Government have not exactly been generous with making moneys available to the Family Court to overcome the problem of just getting adequate court facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to remind the Senate of the problems that have been created in the court with some of the really difficult litigants before it who have taken to making threats of violence and indeed, as we know, in two very sad cases murder has been committed. One case concerned a judge and the other a judge's wife. Very grave injury was caused to the second judge who survived the bomb attack in which his wife was so tragically killed. So the court has been dogged with all sorts of problems over its relatively short life. The judges of the court and all those associated with it-and do not forget that a lot of these threats have been made not only to judges but to counsellors and court staff-have had very great problems to cope with. In my view those problems would not have been any different had that jurisdiction been left with the Supreme Courts of the States. Those problems would still have been there. I do not think that the ordinary traditional court structure would have been at all suitable to deal with those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, there has been an unfortunate attitude towards the Family Court that it somehow is not a proper court, that it is an inferior court, that the judges are not, by and large, of the proper standard for high judicial office and so on. These sorts of criticisms have dogged the Court. One must bear in mind that it is a different sort of court but that does not mean that it is an inferior court. Certainly under the legislation it is a superior court and should be seen to be such. It is our job, as legislators, to react to what I believe and what the Opposition accepts are practical proposals to improve the standing of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic notion of this legislation is to give the Family Court additional jurisdiction in fields other than family law. One of the difficulties for the judges has been a constant diet of family law work. Although it is work of very great importance and sensitivity, nevertheless judges find it a very wearing experience. One can imagine having to make decision after decision about the custody of children or unscrambling a whole lot of tax avoidance trusts when property ownership has to be reorganised after dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is that the Family Court should have additional jurisdiction in Federal matters which would otherwise be dealt with by the Federal Court. That will be done only by consultation between the Chief Judge of the Federal Court and the Chief Judge of the Family Court. I am sure that it will not result in work being handed over to the Family Court which a judge of the Family Court cannot handle. Many Family Court judges would be anxious to do this type of work, and well qualified to do it. The only people who will be able to make those decisions are the respective Chief Judges of the two courts concerned. I have full confidence in those two Chief Judges, not only in Sir Nigel Bowen, the Chief Judge of the Federal Court, but also in the new Chief Judge of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson, whom I do not know to the same personal extent as I know Sir Nigel Bowen. However, he is a man of great reputation in the legal profession. This chamber should have the fullest confidence in both these two Chief Judges to select the cases that are suitable for consideration by the Family Court in the additional areas of taxation and trade practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the judges of the Family Court may not want this jurisdiction. I am sure that those who feel that they do not have the qualifications for it will not even seek to exercise it. Some cases will arise, no doubt, where any of the judges of the Family Court may be able to get some change of work temporarily which will give them time to refresh their minds and their attitudes somewhat from the constant problems and strain of family law work. As I said, the Opposition supports this idea. It is an experiment. The Government will monitor it. We will monitor it. If it does not work it can be changed. It is important that this experiment should be undertaken. I believe that it will work. But, if it does not work, we can change it at a subsequent time. </PARA>
<PARA> In due course the whole nature of the Family Court may change. The Family Court may be brought back into the mainstream of the legal system. One option that no doubt has been considered and will be further considered after this experiment has been tried may be to bring the Family Court back as a division of the Federal Court of Australia. That would mean that judges assigned to that division would still do much the same work as they do now. Judges with a specialised knowledge and understanding of family law work would still be selected for that division of the Federal Court in the same way as they are now for the Family Court. There is no reason why the counselling service should be affected. I believe that is probably the way in which the Family Court will end. Certainly, the jurisdiction conferred on it in this legislation is the first step in that direction, and it is a valuable experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is that the Family Court be seen as part of the judicial system of Australia. It always has been part, but somehow has not been seen to be such. It is important that it be seen to be part of the system. As I have said, ultimately, it may come back even more directly as part of the Federal Court system. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that I believe would be helpful in that regard-we will propose an amendment to this effect-would be to enable the Family Court judges to robe in the same way as other judges do; in that case, practitioners before the court would also robe. At present there is a prohibition on the robing of Family Court judges. We propose that that should be removed and that the judges should be left to make that decision for themselves. I understand they would be likely to decide to resume the wearing of robes. We will debate that point when the amendment is debated, but it is another way in which the Family Court can be seen to be part of the main traditional judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes the creation of an office of judicial registrar to take some of the less important work off the judges of the court, to enable them to concentrate on the major problems of custody and property settlements.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the tax work in this new jurisdiction. There is great concern amongst the taxation professionals-they call themselves the tax institute; that is, mainly lawyers and accountants practising in this field-about the fact that Family Court judges may deal with some tax cases. It is felt that they will not be qualified to do so. But some judges of the Family Court have had a lot of tax experience in private practice before going onto the Court. They certainly will have had a good deal of further experience in this area as judges of the Court because one of the problems in the family law area has been the consideration of various tax avoidance schemes, complicated trusts and so on and the application of tax law in that regard. Many of the judges of the Family Court will have had a lot of experience in dealing with taxation matters, and I am sure that any judges to whom the tax work is referred will be those who have that qualification. Other aspects of the new jurisdiction may require judges to obtain some further experience, but that should not be difficult. Judges of all courts are called upon to deal with cases or parts of the law in which they may not be an expert, but as part of their judicial capacity they are generally able to cope with those matters. If a mistake is made, of course, appeals are still available. Appeals from the Family Court, in exercising this extended jurisdiction, will go to the Full Court of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we are concerned about one proposal in this legislation: that magistrates should be given the jurisdiction to pronounce a dissolution of the marriage in undefended cases. Admittedly, it is only in undefended cases, but we believe that that is wrong. I shall speak on that amendment in more detail when we are in committee. We believe, however, that it is wrong for the serious matter of divorce to be seen to be down-played in any way by its simply being shunted off to a magistrates court, convenient as it may be in certain cases. The dissolution of marriage is a very solemn matter-the same as entering into a marriage-and it should not be seen to be done lightly or unadvisedly. That responsibility should be retained by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate that the Family Court deserves a great deal more recognition and certainly a great deal more praise than it has received in its short life. It would have been better had the Family Court been structured on a State basis, as the Family Law Act enabled to be done and which was done in Western Australia. State governments and parliaments were given the option of doing so, but the Western Australian Parliament and Government were the only ones to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We initiated that amendment, as Senator Chaney reminds me, when the Bill went through this Parliament. The Western Australian State Family Court has been the most successful of the Family Courts, largely because of the administration of that court. It would have been easier if it had been a task for each State rather than having to tackle all these problems on a national basis. I have already dealt with what the problems were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Family Court should not be blamed, in any way, for whatever failings there have been in the Family Law Act. Frankly, I believe that the Family Law Act was correct in establishing a no fault system of divorce. The joint parliamentary committee that reviewed the act after three or four years of its operation came to the same conclusion. I have not had any reason to change the view that I have always held-that the concept of no fault divorce is sensible.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, some grave problems have been found with the Family Law Act, many of which have already been addressed in this Parliament. We ought to be directing our attention to those problems and not spending our time, as so many people do, criticising the Family Court and expecting it to be able to solve problems which have been imposed on it by this Parliament or, in particular, by community values, which have changed so dramatically and which it has had to tackle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987, I want to concentrate my remarks on the part of the Bill that has the effect of tacking on to the Family Court a number of additional jurisdictions-bankruptcy, taxation, and restrictive trade practices, to mention a few-and therefore creates some new form of hybrid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned and somewhat disappointed about the way that the Government has gone about tackling this matter, bearing in mind the tradition of the development of the Family Court of Australia in this Parliament and the contribution to that progress by the committee system of the Parliament, in particular, in the first instance, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-as it was-which reported in 1974, and then subsequently a joint select committee of the Parliament, which reported some years later on the whole subject of family law and which had the opportunity of reviewing the original establishment of the Court. I believe that these reports made a major contribution to the development of this Court and its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes very major changes to the whole structure of the Family Court. In fact, it is very much a first step towards abandoning the specialised Family Court system. What disappoints me in these circumstances is that this Government has not been prepared to go back to its committee system to have a further in-depth analysis of whether there is just cause for this radical turnaround and an examination of whether, in fact, the Court has failed in such a way that we need to take a step towards abandoning its specialised nature. I am disappointed that the Government has not allowed those people who have strong views on the subject the forum to enable them to put those views to the legislators. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of my Party in the other place, in order to facilitate such an in-depth consideration, sought to have the Bill referred to the newly-constituted House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Government refused to do so, although there was no good reason for its refusing. That Committee could have considered the matter over the Christmas break because there was then adequate time. If it had done so we could now have been debating the Bill with the advantage of that detailed consideration by a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that when that request was refused we in this place sought to refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. That also was refused by the Government and the Australian Democrats. This is a matter of regret to me. Therefore, we are debating this Bill today and the proposed creation of a hybrid without the advantage of the detailed, in-depth consideration which would have been given to it by the Senate's Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at the Bill I fail to see how the development of the proposed hybrid would improve the situation. There seems to me to be almost an element of desperation in the Bill. When I read the words of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) in responding to the debate in the other place that desperation seemed to come through. Nobody is suggesting that it is a logical advance in the Family Court system to add the jurisdictions of taxation, restrictive trade practices and others. No one is suggesting that that is a logical improvement to the system. Rather, what the Attorney-General is saying is, `I am desperate. I need to do something because the judges are unhappy and there have been problems associated with the Court'-Senator Durack referred to the very sad events of a couple of murders associated with the Court-`I need to be seen to be doing something. Therefore, I have come up with the creation of a hybrid'. Of course, the hybrid really has come out of the proposal that the Family Court be fully integrated within the Federal Court of Australia. There were problems associated with that proposal in that some of the judges simply were not suited or were not adequately qualified for that status. That idea was abandoned and the Government came up with this compromise which, like all compromises, has major weaknesses. We should be addressing whether, in fact, now is the time to move away from the specialised nature of the Court. We should be asking: Has the Court failed because of its specialised nature? Should the specialised nature of the Court be the basis of criticism in regard to the unfortunate events that have been associated with it over the years it has been in existence. I certainly have not seen arguments that convince me that it is the specialised nature of the Court that is at fault. </PARA>
<PARA> I can reflect upon the days when this jurisdiction was operated under the old Matrimonial Causes Act. In my practice in that field I regarded it as quite horrific-the gathering of evidence to try to prove matrimonial fault; the employment of private investigators to peer through people's windows at night in the gathering of evidence and bringing it to court; and the associated stresses. This was not a human way of dealing with what is a great trauma to many married couples in this country-the breakdown of their marriage. I applauded the establishment of a no fault system and a specialised court with judges who had to be particularly qualified to understand the sensitivities of marriage breakdowns and look to helping the parties through that unfortunate phase of their lives and I still applaud it. I think it was the correct way to go. Certainly there are problems, but the question is: Are the problems to be addressed by abandoning the specialised nature of the court, or are the problems to be addressed in other ways?</PARA>
<PARA> I will refer honourable senators to a couple of articles and views which I would have thought would give this Senate cause to progress slowly in this matter. It will enable the Senate to give further consideration to what it will be doing by passing this legislation. I refer, firstly, to a speech that was given by the then Chief Judge of the Family Court, Justice Elizabeth Evatt. It might be said that she had some vested interest in the matter. I will read a couple of paragraphs from a speech which she gave in Adelaide on 10 March last year when she spoke of the Family Court and its problems and benefits. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court has been an innovative Court, and has succeeded in establishing close and productive working relationships between Judges, drawn from the traditional legal system, and Court Counsellors whose training and experience is in the area of personal relationships. No one could claim that the system is perfect, but it is continually developing in response to the perceived needs of the community and within the limits of the resources made available to it. </PARA>
<PARA>She raises the subject of resources, which I think is critical in this debate. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Court is not resistant to change, but it would be a matter of concern if fundamental changes to the Family Law system were introduced which might hinder the Court from pursuing the goals and philosophies for which it had originally been established. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, it is more important to pay attention to the real problems which beset us-</PARA>
<PARA>jurisdiction;</PARA>
<PARA>resources;</PARA>
<PARA>accommodation; and</PARA>
<PARA>community education. </PARA>
<PARA>I respectfully adopt and applaud the words of Justice Evatt when she suggested `that we direct our minds not so much to the construction of the Court and its specialised nature, but rather to the subjects of its jurisdiction, particularly its resources, the problem of poor accommodation and the continuing need for community education on what are the goals and methods of the Court and particularly its counselling role and its potential to further develop its counselling role.' I would like the Senate in this debate to consider those words. Also a similar sentiment was expressed by Mr Justice Fogarty in an article entitled `Family Court-Possible future directions' which was recorded in the University of New South Wales Law Journal, 1985. I will quote from his article. He was speaking on the same debate as to what happens to the specialised jurisdiction and where we might head in this area in the future. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A preferable course in my view is to direct our energies towards the improvement of the operation of the Family Court itself. It needs to be remembered that the Court has existed for just on a decade, a very short period of time in the lifetime of most courts. It has been highly successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. It has also attracted a great deal of controversy and criticism. Some judicial tribunal to deal with family law has to exist in our society as in any other society and the only relevant question is the form and substance of that tribunal. Experience both within Australia over the last several decades and in all overseas countries with comparable social backgrounds demonstrates the extreme difficulty of providing universally acceptable family laws within that society, particularly because of the enormous changes in social patterns in the last two decades and the difficulties which confront any tribunal which has to administer such a fluid and difficult area of social relations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is considerations like that that I believe we should be addressing, and recognising the difficulties in this area, including the short period the Court has been in existence. Mr Justice Fogarty went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The substance of this Paper is that the Family Court concept is a desirable one in our society, that it needs improvements, and that the energies of its critics would be more usefully directed towards improvements to the system rather than engaging in attempts to destroy the present system without providing any serious alternative. </PARA>
<PARA>In a very constructive way he then went on to look at some of the subjects for debate in this matter, and at some of the areas that could be improved. He particularly addressed in the paper the Court and court formality, the continued development of the conciliation process, which is something I applaud, the continued and increasing recognition of the separation of the conciliation and judicial process, greater development of marriage counselling at an early stage of marriage crisis and case management by the Court. I again respectfully adopt these words of Mr Justice Fogarty and say that the Senate would be better conducting a detailed consideration of those constructive areas for development and further improvement of our family law system rather than, as it is doing today, forming a new, hybrid jurisdiction-that of a family court which engages in taxation matters, in restrictive trade matters, in bankruptcy matters and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I want briefly to pick out one of those matters that Mr Justice Fogarty referred to-the greater development of marriage counselling at an early stage of marriage crisis. As we all know, this Court has been criticised for not saving marriages-something which is an impossible task because, unfortunately, when the parties have got to the stage of instituting proceedings and coming before family law counsellors, the marriage has broken down and it is too late. I suggest to the Government that rather than engage in this debate today it would be more constructive to look at putting some really worthwhile resources into marriage guidance, including the Marriage Guidance Council and the various church counsellors and others who are prepared to help parties through marriage difficulties, and therefore look, rather than to the remedy of dissolution, to ways in which some marriages could be saved. </PARA>

<PARA> If I might get back to the principal debate, I simply remind honourable senators that it was the Senate Standing Committee itself which called for a jurisdiction to deal exclusively with family law matters in its report of 1974, and it was a joint committee of this Parliament which in its report of 1980, after very comprehensive consideration of the matter, further endorsed that concept. I remind the Senate that on page 123 of that report the Joint Select Committee, involving all parties of this Parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to create a separate court was quite deliberately made . . . It was considered that the qualities and attributes of Family Court judges and the nature of the court over which they were to preside, required the establishment of a specialist court. A court, moreover, which would provide a bridge between jurisdiction previously exercised by the Supreme courts in divorce matters and the State courts of summary jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee regards this policy consideration as still valid and does not support the creation of a Family Court division within the Federal Court structure. </PARA>
<PARA>On each occasion that a committee of this Parliament has considered this question in depth, it has come down in support of the concept of a specialised court. Unfortunately, this Government is not prepared to take the matter back for consideration by another committee but, rather, is determined to put it through the Parliament with its numbers and make this very substantial and significant change by creating a hybrid. I believe it is taking the first step towards the destruction of this specialised court and jurisdiction, and I regret that. I do not believe the Government has acted in the best interests of the Australian people in dealing with the matter in that way and I use this opportunity to express my concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to speak on the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987, I find it very difficult not to link my views on this Bill to the ever-increasing number of representations that are presently being made to me and my electorate office. Senators Durack and Hill-and I presume Senators Cooney and Chaney might have something to say about it-no doubt through their legal practices or past legal practices, would have come across and made contact with the poor unfortunate people who are in the throes of divorce, separation or whatever, far more than I would. So I speak on this matter purely as a humble family man, a very new politician, and someone who can base his observations, I suppose, only on people who are friends of mine, on acquaintances and on those who come to my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, it is fair to say that over the past few years there has been a veritable plethora of Labor-inspired legislation which has sought to destroy the family unit and degrade the sanctity of marriage and the result of that union-the family. This Bill will, in effect, turn the Family Court into a rubber stamp and make divorce even easier at a time when already 40 per cent of families have experienced the trauma of divorce. Property division is no longer linked to blame, and the courts have proved ineffective in enforcing maintenance provisions, thereby placing an ever-increasing burden on the taxpayer to support the results of these broken marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> No other institution can replace the completeness of the family which brings children into the world and surrounds them with love and caring. It is a frightening statistic that second marriages now have a higher rate of divorce than first marriages, with the result that thousands of young Australian children will experience a second divorce while still at school. That does not even account for third marriages. Perhaps, with the way things are going and the way the Bill will make things much easier, we will end up with fourth marriages. We could end up with a country full of people such as Joan Collins and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that the vast majority of Australians are feeling very threatened by the line of thinking which became trendy during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and despite its obvious failure it continues to be championed by the present Labor Government of this country. My responsibility and that of my Liberal Party colleagues is to ensure the protection of the family unit within the Parliament. It is a task for which we are very well suited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because we care for families. Within the chaos which has become known as the Family Court of Australia, the Government is now trying to do a patch-up job. It is a patch-up job because it fails to address many of the key problems facing the Family Court and at the same time compounds matters by introducing a number of initiatives which quite clearly have not been thought through properly. This is rushed proposed legislation, which has been devised without due consultation with the appropriate professional bodies. It has received the condemnation of those professionals who are charged with dealing with the Family Court on a daily basis. I am sure that all honourable senators have been lobbied by such professional people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This `quickie legislation' is designed to complement the `quickie divorces'-which is what they are, and which it espouses. What a sorry state for Australian families and their children, who will be expected to operate under its guidelines. When my colleague the Hon. Neil Brown spoke in the other place about this matter, he stated the obvious, as did Senator Durack this morning. We have seen assassination attempts; we have seen a murder; we have been deluged with complaints; delays have choked the system; and something is very, very wrong. The Family Court as it exists today is a veritable minefield of problems. It is a daily tragedy of human emotions which is further compounded by the trauma of its judges. The question we must ask is: Will this legislation, prepared as it has been in such haste, make a positive difference or will it merely serve to compound matters. I personally fear that it is the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill in its present form does four things. It increases the scope of work performed by the Family Court of Australia to include decisions under the administration, bankruptcy, trade practices and income tax assessment Acts. It creates the offices of judicial registrar in the Family Court. It enables judges to delegate further duties to registrars. And, finally, it extends the jurisdiction which may be exercised by courts of summary jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> When examining the effect that the Bill may have on the operation of the courts, it must be noted that custodial and access matters are able to be dealt with summarily by magistrates already. This power is limited by the financial limitations placed on each court. The Bill extends the limit from $1,000 to $10,000 without the consent of the parties. Where there is consent, the court is not restricted to monetary constraints. It is arguable whether these instances where magistrates already have authority are properly dealt with summarily or whether they ought to be dealt with by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important is that in my State practitioners usually petition the Family Court for the matter to be heard by the Family Court. This is a clear indication that those practising the law do not believe it is appropriate for these matters to be dealt with by magistrates. Therefore, any changes to the Family Law Act may be given nominal effect by the practitioners, which again highlights the need to examine the detail before implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill states that matters will be dealt with summarily only where an action is undefended. A case is undefended when both parties agree to the divorce and one party has applied for the divorce and the other has responded. The only criterion necessary is that the couple have lived apart for 12 months, subject to few exceptions such as where there has been an attempt at re-cohabitation which has been unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> To fulfil the criteria for a divorce under the Family Law Act is fairly straightforward. The actual granting of a divorce is a right enjoyed by the parties so that, for any court, whether summary or family jurisdiction, it is more a procedural matter than anything else. In this jurisdiction it is almost a matter of rubber stamping. The problems arise when there are disputed cases over property and custody of children. Such contested disputes arise in both defended and undefended cases. The Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, may well be right when he states that 95 per cent of cases are undefended, but problems will still arise as a consequence of divorce proceedings being instituted or following the granting of a divorce. In a practical sense, the problem is not in leaving the matter of granting a divorce to the lower courts but in giving the courts of summary jurisdiction increased power to resolve disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only the other day that a young lady came to my office seeking assistance. She has been divorced for some 12 months. Her former husband is now living in a de facto relationship with another lady. The ex-husband and his de facto partner both work. One would think that they would have quite a deal of money in the bank but, because they are clever people, their bank accounts show approximately $6 in one account and $15 in another. The young lady who came to my office seeking assistance has custody of two teenage children. I am sure we would all know the sorts of problems she would be experiencing with them. She receives maintenance, and this is one of the problems that arises. She receives maintenance from her husband but, because she was smart enough to go out and get a reasonable job, work hard, earn a reasonable wage, and manage to have some money in the bank, her ex-husband considered that it was about time that he took her to court and tried to reduce the amount of maintenance he was paying. She had no say in it, of course. Summarily, they went to court and he lost the case. Nevertheless she was required to pay not only legal fees for her defence but also court costs. I believe-we are looking at this in our office at the moment-that this can happen at any time and when he feels fit or nasty about the situation he can bring her back to court at any time he wishes. These are the types of things that are happening and they are the types of things that the Family Court should be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill and Senator Durack referred to the selection of judges for the Family Court of Australia, which is more specific as the tasks they need to perform are readily identifiable and, while complex, do not vary as to the types of legal problems which arise. These judges are picked for their special skills in dealing with families and for their knowledge of the needs of families and the problems with the break-up of families. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unrealistic to imagine that magistrates have such skills as well as the more general abilities which they must have to administer the general law. Under this Bill it is likely magistrates would gain only a smattering of family law cases so they would be unable to build up an expertise in such matters. Conversely, family law judges deal with family law matters daily and have the expertise both prior to and during their tenure as judges. As it stands at the present the Family Court is unique as regards other areas of law in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the common law, which is based on precedent and trial by jury, and statute law, which is derived from the criminal code and the Acts of State and Federal government, the Family Law Act is enacted by the Parliament and the scope for discretion as embodied in the statute is large. The statute gives the judge far-reaching powers to come to an equitable decision with regard to the parties and the law. Provided the judge has followed the statutes, it is difficult for a higher court such as the Full Court of the Family Court or the High Court of Australia to over-rule his or her decision. The responsibility this puts on Family Court judges is great and it is evident in the pressure placed on them and on others dealing with them. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill then, attempts to relieve this pressure by delegating some of these responsibilities to registrars, therefore giving Family Court judges the opportunity to be involved in other work. Without wishing to sound disrespectful, I must admit that I have some difficulty in rationalising whether magistrates in summary jurisdictions should have their powers enhanced to include the discretion which Family Court judges enjoy without the relevant expertise, knowledge and pressures. In addition, the Bill seeks to take the legal costs out of the processes by making them more timely and this would certainly be supported by all. However, will this necessarily be the result when the magistrates courts are already clogged by matters such as driving offences? It is also clear that the application must still be lodged in the Family Court so there will still be costs and time associated with this process before the papers for dissolution of marriage are passed on to a court of summary jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, in its present format, also raises a number of important social issues. Section 44a inserts into the Act the ability of the applicant to transfer proceedings into a court of summary jurisdiction and section 45 (2) facilitates this where it is convenient for the parties. It can well be argued that this process circumvents the intention of the Family Law Act and especially the amendments made to it in 1983. The 1983 amendments give weight to the counselling role of the Family Court and in certain instances demand that the parties use a mediator to reconcile some of their differences. Unlike the position in the proposed summary jurisdiction, there was at least some sort of discourse between the parties. The intended powers of the magistrates in such circumstances is not entirely clear though it appears likely that in such instances the operation of the system may well cost the applicants more money, aside from the trauma which would flow from such interchange between the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The family unit is the basis of our society, one of which we are all immensely proud. Surely then, giving magistrates the power to end the marriage contract when all avenues may not have been exhausted can only serve to lessen the social fabric of our society. A couple who may already be feeling a profound sense of guilt over their failure to keep a marriage going hardly need to be placed in the situation where they must finalise these matters in a court where they are surrounded by `real' offenders who have allegedly wronged society. Neither is the presence of these hardened criminal offenders likely to help the children of those being divorced who may pre present. Courts of summary jurisdiction have simply not been designed to aid in the smooth transition for children from being in a family unit to being with a single parent. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 when, largely due to the work of the then Attorney-General, the late Lionel Murphy, the Family Law Act was first enacted, the aim was to facilitate the messy aspects of divorce where the parties chose to part permanently after 12 months of separation. What was integral to the Act and which I believe the late Justice Murphy intended was that prior to the divorce proceedings there was to be counselling to enable the parties to try to find a common ground and if at all possible reconciliation. I am continually dismayed that since 1975 this counselling has received low priority by governments and funding has continually declined, often dramatically, since the first implementation of the Act. It is therefore regrettable that this latest Bill will do nothing to redress the situation. It would appear that counselling is to be used less and less, which will no doubt prove to be a suitable excuse to reduce funding in this area even further. Research in Australia and in the United States has shown many marriages may have been saved by counselling prior to a divorce application being lodged. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, what is really needed is a greater community awareness of counselling, both government and church, for couples to solve their problems before reaching the divorce courts Government counselling is contained in the Acts of Parliament, but has all too often been neglected. It is unlikely that the proposed move to courts of summary jurisdiction will give any weight to the need for more awareness of counselling facilities. Indeed, the opposite may well prove to be true as magistrates will be unlikely to be as aware of the existence of such facilities as are Family Court judges. This should not be seen as a criticism or fault of magistrates; it is merely the result of their different functions in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Family Court judges are often heard to stress the importance of the knowledge and the detail which their highly trained professional support staff are able to devote to every case. This comprehensive case management ensures that each case gets the attention it deserves and is treated on its merits. I find it difficult to see how this change of jurisdiction will serve to benefit a separating couple, except perhaps financially. As I have mentioned previously, the family law area is unique. The welfare of the child is clearly paramount in any decisions involving children and judges have an enormous amount of discretion when deciding cases. I therefore stress that any changes to the existing system without a thorough investigation of the consequences is extremely dangerous because of the delicate nature of the legislation. It is therefore not surprising that family law practitioners throughout Australia have been unanimous in expressing their concern over these changes being made without proper consultation with the groups involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are really debating is whether we ought to continue with a separate specialised family court or not. In looking at this legislation from this point of view it is interesting to look back to the Hansard of 13 December 1973 when the late Justice Lionel Murphy was Attorney-General. Then Senator Murphy said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of which court or courts are to exercise this extensive jurisdiction. I have decided against setting up separate, Federal family courts. </PARA>
<PARA>That legislation did not come into effect. I think there were two further debates before legislation came into effect. Between that time and the court being set up it was decided to set up a separate Family Court. During all of the debates there has been interest in whether this was the right way in which to proceed. It is not the only area, of course, which has its own court. I suggest, though, that it is different from all of the others. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a particularly stressful jurisdiction. I think that has been exhibited by the history that has been recounted this morning by both Senator Durack and Senator Hill. It is certainly my view that it is more stressful than other jurisdictions in which men and women act as judges to administer the judicial system. So the concept of extending their jurisdiction to give them other work opportunities is something that many people have talked about for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat disappointed, though, at the way in which it is being done. I am prepared to go along with it to see whether it works. I do not think it is the ideal way in which to extend the jurisdiction of the Court. It is being extended to deal with areas relating to bankruptcy, income tax appeals, consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act and proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. I wonder whether the notion of giving different and more extensive powers to the Family Court has any meaning, because it does not permit any of these matters to be instituted in the Family Court. They can be dealt with there only if proceedings are transferred to the Family Court from the Federal Court at the request of the parties or by the Federal Court on its own initiative. It seems to me that that is an incredibly complex and therefore expensive way of going about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether it will ever happen. In what circumstances would two people decide that they would want matters of this kind shifted? In regard to some of the areas in which the Government is one of the parties to the proceedings, what pressure will be put on parties to shift to another court? Which of the judges will hear the matter? The provision as to how this will happen is glib and lacking in real meaning. It is to be decided by the Chief Judges of the two courts. Will they go through the lists every morning and say, `This one will be dealt with by the Family Court and these three will stay in the Federal Court.'? I am not trying to be trite in putting it in those terms, but how will it be done? Will people have to suggest that this be done or, as I say, when the Government is involved, decide what pressure will be put on people to take, for example, their income tax appeals to a Family Court that is a bit short of business at the time? But which of the Family Courts is a bit short of business? Then we could move on to the concept of shoving other matters to the magistrates court. It is all designed to look as though something is actually being done, without analysing the problems of the Family Court, finding proper solutions, restructuring it, giving it additional, meaningful jurisdiction and appointing sufficient judges to enable the work to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been recognised for some time that the Court needs to be looked at. The former Chief Judge has questioned whether a separate Family Court was appropriate. The Judicial System Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission indicated in February 1987 that a major overhaul was needed. It was not, in my view, being critical of the men and women who are the judges of the Court. It indicated clearly that it was necessary to increase salaries, reduce the work load and improve the resources of the Court. That, of course, includes not only resources for judges but also the resources available for counselling. It also referred to adding variety to the judges' work. It is a pity that those recommendations have not been dealt with in a way which gives some meaning to the function of the Family Court in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, what skills do Family Court judges have to review tax? I know a number of Family Court judges. I have had the opportunity to work with them and I have a very high regard for the ones that I know. I have no doubt that most of them could deal with tax and many other matters. Why then is not the Family Court being made a part of the Federal Court? It can only be that somebody thinks that Family Court judges generally are not fit to be Federal Court judges. I do not know which ones it is thought fall into that category. We will find some Federal Court matters being shifted. If we are not careful we will have a two-tiered system of judges in the Family Court. There will be a `them and us' situation-those who are good enough to be Federal Court judges and do some of the Federal Court work and those who are not. I question this proposal. It reads well at first glance. It looks as though something is being done. I think it may create more problems than it solves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are at present about 46 Family Court judges. It is very clear that Sydney needs at least three more Family Court judges to cope with the work. An answer to a question on notice was printed in Hansard only this week which indicates the length of time involved in waiting for dissolution proceedings. For the most part it is six to eight weeks. Sydney has the longest waiting time. Sydney, again, has by far the longest waiting time for defended cases which are waiting to be heard. One must wait a number of months to get such a matter heard. Delays in Family Court hearings cause tremendous distress to the parties and to the children involved. They frequently involve money and property matters, but the emotional involvement of the people concerned means that the longer these matters are delayed, the greater stress is placed on parties and on the judge who knows that he is dealing with a matter that has gone on for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, in my view, to appoint, and keep appointed, the appropriate number of judges to see that the work is able to be done properly. There are other judges in the Family Court system who are not well and who may like to retire. I think that two fall into that category who are not able to deal with much work at present. Other judges have reached the age at which they are eligible to retire. There are some who would like to retire who know that their places will not be filled, or not filled quickly, and that if they retired they would put a greater degree of stress on their brother judges and on those who are running the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The counselling service was set up to deal with some of the emotional problems relating to dissolution of marriage. It ought to be able to fulfil its role. But the counselling service in every registry of the court that I know of is overworked. There are insufficient counsellors to enable it to do the work which needs to be done. It is not just a question of the odd counselling session at the time of the breakdown of a marriage, or of counselling at the time that a divorce or custody settlement is being dealt with by the court. In many instances the parties need the support of counsellors for years in order to make access arrangements work and to sort out a number of other ongoing problems. At the time when one of the former parties to a marriage remarries there may well be a need for counselling so that the parties can sort out the new arrangements, so that the children can understand what is occurring, and to see that it works smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA> Another speaker this morning has already referred to the fact that the number of breakdowns of second marriages is considerable. I think that is well known. The stress for children is made even worse when the second marriage breaks down. How many of those problems could be solved if adequate counselling was available? I refer also, of course, to the plea made by the marriage counselling service for adequate funds to enable it more effectively to intervene and help people solve their problems. People tend to go to the marriage counselling service when they have difficulties. They tend more to the Family Court when breakdown has occurred. The money that is being spent on marriage counselling, whilst it may sound a lot, $5.2m, is really not a lot when we look at the cost of $1.5 billion on legal aid, the Family Court, supporting parents' benefits and what is referred to as the divorce industry. It is perhaps time that we re-examined our priorities in this area and made meaningful the words that were spoken about the counselling service when this legislation was initially set up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that we will have registrars. Many of us know what registrars do. Nothing in this legislation tells us what the registrars in the Family Court will do, nothing at all. I am inclined to think that it is merely a way of avoiding appointing judges and saving funds in that sense. It may be of benefit, but we are not told enough about it, other than to make it look as though it is a solution to take work away from the judges. They would have power to delegate, but it would be a long time before that would become meaningful, before the system would establish exactly what role the registrars can play. Will they be de facto counsellors? What work will they be doing? Will they be doing the arithmetic associated with the information supplied in relation to property and maintenance? We would like to know more about what is envisaged before we can be enthusiastic about whether that means something really new and valuable or whether it is a cost saving measure to avoid appointing judges to the court. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the wearing of robes has come up in this discussion. I have for many years been of the view that it was a mistake to abolish robes from the Court. The concept of informality in the Family Court is superficially attractive, but it is a court and it is a place where significant decisions are being made about people's lives, about people's property and about the future that children will have, and it is a place where people are frequently upset and frequently very emotional. I have said that several times and it cannot be overstressed. The robes are not a means of aggrandisement or anything of that nature. They are a means of establishing anonymity, and showing that the person making the decision has been judged suitable and capable of doing so; that he is not just one of the boys at the pub, that he is a person chosen for a specific purpose, to play a specific role. Solicitors in the court also come into that category. I think the concept of robes, without going into it in more detail, helps establish that form of anonymity. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if robes had been part of this Court's tradition right through until now we might have had less violence towards judges because they have been more readily identified by some people who have attacked them. I may be wrong, but I really believe that is the case. It is in fact difficult to recognise a person, unless we know him well, when he is not robed if we have seen him only when he has been robed. It is not a question of hiding behind anything. I just think it is a better way to run the system. We should not carry the concept of informality too far. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the magistrates courts are concerned, some magistrates would deal most suitably with the matters that would come before them, although I cannot accept the concept of dissolution of marriage in the lower court, and I think that argument has been put. Perhaps that is a personal matter, but I see something as important as dissolving a marriage as being something that ought to be done in a superior court. Many of the other matters might be done in a magistrates court, but I do not think that jurisdiction should be given to a magistrate to deal with money in a Family Court matter that is in excess of the amount that he is able to deal with in his normal jurisdiction. That seems to me to be absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that really comes to my mind is where on earth are the magistrates going to get time to deal with this extra jurisdiction? If any other State or Territory has magistrates sitting around with little to do, I would be surprised. The magistrates in the court in my electorate are certainly not sitting around with nothing to do. There are incredible waiting times for the hearing of criminal matters that ought to be dealt with quite promptly. There are long waiting periods for getting all sorts of magistrates court matters dealt with at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no indication whatsoever in the financial impact statement that is given with this legislation that there are going to be funds around for a whole range of extra magistrates. For that reason I certainly would have to reject the concept. But again I think the actual role of the magistrates and the way the magistrates court would be established has not been thought through. Presumably we would have to have a separate section of a magistrates court to deal with the areas of property, custody and maintenance. Those matters could not be mixed up amongst parking fines, traffic offences and street offences. None of this information is presented here, which leads me to think that this is a somewhat cosmetic reaction to the problems of the Family Court that has not been thought through and presented as well as it might. Questions need to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern for finding solutions is such that I will keep an open mind while watching what occurs. I hope that all who have an interest in it will do the same, and that quite soon the Government will establish a mechanism for monitoring the changes which are to take place as a result of these amendments, given that the Government will not allow them to be examined more fully before they come into operation, because it certainly is a most important area of activity and it is something that affects the lives of many people. When two people find themselves in a situation where their marriage has failed, the impact in many terms, not least financially, is quite wide. Of course, the children are very much a part of it. I would hope that in time we will get to a situation where the Family Court really operates in the way most of us would want it to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill has been well discussed by the speakers before me. The various issues they mentioned are very pertinent to the question of how this whole tragic area of family disputes can best be resolved. No matter what laws we have, no matter what regulations we bring in and no matter what structure we set up, they will not work unless the people who operate that structure, who administer the laws and who carry out the provisions of the relevant Act and interpret the law are of the highest quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that recently Mr Justice Alastair Nicholson was appointed Chief Judge of the Family Court of Australia at the same time as he was appointed a Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, so he holds the two positions. In Mr Justice Alastair Nicholson we have the sort of person who is best equipped to make legislation in this area operate and operate effectively. He has had an outstanding career as a member of the Victorian Bar for a number of years. He has conducted inquiries with great skill and he was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court in the early part of this decade. He fulfilled his functions there in an outstanding fashion. If we discussed his ability on the bench with anybody at the Bar I think they would have nothing but praise for him. Over the years he has done a great deal of work, and he still does, with the legal branch of the Royal Australian Air Force. He has fulfilled his position there with great skill. He is a man of great charm. I simply say in conclusion that when this Bill becomes an Act, I am sure the new Chief Judge will administer it in as good a fashion as is possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot say that I have ever known Senator Cooney to speak for such a short time, even on the weather. I would like to start my comments in this debate on the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987 by complimenting Senator Durack on what I believe was, by and large, an extremely good speech. It was considered, it was essentially sensible and, more importantly, it was non-inflammatory in a debate which could, if some people wished it to, become quite controversial. Dealing with human emotions, with marriage and, in particular, with divorce can sometimes become an issue which excites the imaginings of some people. Senator Durack certainly dealt with this issue in a particularly well-considered way, but I have to admit that I did not agree with everything that he said about the extension of the role of magistrates courts, for example. But by and large I applauded his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish I could say the same thing about Senator Calvert. Several times he made the comment that something is very wrong in the Family Court and referred to the trauma of judges. Certainly we all agree with that. But would he, I ask, like to go back to a situation where the trauma was on thousands of families in Australia, a situation where women and children were treated violently within the marriage and inequitably outside it? Do we assume from Senator Calvert's comments that something was not very wrong before no fault divorce or before judges occasionally became the targets of abuse by a few idiots whose behaviour, I might add, rather than inducing sympathy ought to confirm the validity of the divorce petition granted against them?</PARA>
<PARA> We need to remember that this legislation is the latest in a series of changes to laws relating to divorce that have come before British and Australian parliaments in the past 100 years or so. It may be worth while, given some of the more extreme statements made about marriage, divorce laws, custody and property distribution in letters to editors and so on in recent months, to recollect some of those changes, most of which were met with hysterical responses, as well as more considered responses, from various sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, as you yourself would well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, in historical terms it is only recently that women have had any rights at all in marriage. Until late last century, under British law a married woman had no right to own property, even that property which she brought into the marriage, and, in the event of a breakdown of the marriage, she lost not only her possessions but also her children if she were the one who was fleeing the home. Changes to the law to give women rights of ownership of property and custody of children were met with outraged comments that the husband's rights were being eschewed and that civilisation as we knew it at the time would crumble. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia earlier this century men were entitled to divorce their wives on the ground of adultery alone. Women were not given that right until much later-a classic example of the law made by men entrenching the sexual double standard that still applies in the minds of many people today. Fault-based divorce was a costly exercise that weighed heavily in favour of the husband. He more easily than she had access to lawyers, to private investigators and, more importantly, to the money to pay for those to collect and present the evidence that was needed for him to dissolve the marriage. The court system, with its preponderance of male lawyers and judges, was likely to, and indeed did, take a dim view of any woman whose behaviour fell outside the usual stereotypes. The church, the law and society generally tacitly supported the right of a husband to beat his wife, to be unfaithful to her whenever he chose and to be a lousy provider, while at the same time expecting a wife to be faithful, obedient and a good wife, mother and housekeeper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters sounds amused by this, but I suggest that she go back and have a look at some judicial decisions, talk to some of the women who have been to see their priests or their clergymen and find out just how many of those people regarded it as the sole responsibility of the woman to maintain the marriage, blamed her if the husband was unfaithful, told her to go home and try harder if she were being beaten, and expected her to ignore any abuse of her children because it was the husband's right to chastise not only the wife but also the children.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly true. Police attitudes to domestic violence, as distinct from any other sort of assault, are still a vestige of this attitude that a good clip on the ear is what will settle most wives down to doing what they are supposed to do-that is, acting dutifully and in obedience to the husband. When the matter reached the court and property was divided, the woman's contribution was often limited and hence the amount that she received was often limited as she had had no opportunity either to bring money or property into the marriage or to earn and acquire it during the marriage. Women and children were, as they often still are, left largely in poverty following fault-based divorce in which the woman was granted custody of the children but no or few assets from the marriage. Sadly, it has been only very recently that the homemaker's contribution has been recognised. That has caused not only a lot of injustice to many women but a lot of concern to a lot of other women. She stayed at home, gave up her opportunities to have independently a career and earn money, brought up the children, helped her husband often in his career, and yet was given by and large very little credit for that when the property distribution decisions were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stupidity and injustice of this was recognised and partially remedied in the Family Law Act of the 1970s. With it came outraged comments that the husband's rights were being eschewed and, as I said earlier, that civilisation as we know it would crumble and that marriage as an institution was being degraded. Mention was very rarely made of the value of the individuals in the marriage or the rights of both partners and their children to live in a safe, secure and loving environment or be given the opportunity of escaping from misery without finishing up in penury-which is not to say that current divorce laws are perfect or that current attitudes to marriage are ideal; but then, they never have been. It was not ideal when women were classed as non-persons following marriage. It was not ideal when one partner could extricate himself from a marriage and live comfortably ever after but the other partner could not. It was not ideal when a divorce could only be granted after the airing of real or manufactured grievances in a system which really benefited only the lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> By the same token, it is not a good system which puts Family Court judges and their families at risk of death or maiming, and in which women are left in penury anyway following the dissolution of marriage and then become the target of every group in the community that wants to see the Budget deficit reduced by slashing government expenditure on the welfare of those women and their children. Nor is it an adequate system that pays Family Court judges less than their Federal Court counterparts, which denigrates those judges as being less capable than their colleagues because they deal with people rather than property, and which allows aggrieved individuals to take a judicial decision personally because the judgment is delivered in a homely situation quite different from other courts by a judge in street clothes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time we recognised the fact that Family Court judges have a tougher job than judges ruling on tax matters because Family Court judges are dealing with human beings, some of whom, including children, are victims of physical abuse and all of whom are in emotional turmoil. It is time we put Family Court judges back into robes, if not wigs, set them apart quite distinctly from the individuals with whom they are dealing and acknowledged the stresses they face and the difficulties of the work they do by paying them accordingly. That brings me to this Bill, its contents and its deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill extends to the Family Court of Australia the capacity to excercise jurisdiction in proceedings other than those relating specifically to the Family Law Act. These include certain proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act and in taxation appeals under the Income Tax Assessment Act. There have been quite vocal critics of this move from within the legal profession and outside it who argue that the Family Court does not attract a high class of person as judge and that therefore such judges should not be given important or complex legal questions to determine. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got ourselves caught up in a vicious circle based very largely on legal prejudice and the massive emphasis on status that seems to prevail within that profession. We certainly fully support the move to extend these matters to Family Court judges. It is not fair to pay one group of judges less than their colleagues, fail, therefore, to encourage some of the more money-minded members of the legal profession on to that bench and then argue that Family Court judges are not capable of dealing with matters other than those of human misery because they are not good enough and that the good people go on to deal with property matters, tax matters and so on. We have to break that circle, and now is the time to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we fully support this move, however limited it is, to extend the jurisdiction of Family Court judges. The Australian Democrats believe that the Family Court should be brought back into the Federal Court system. I was pleased to hear Senator Durack commenting favourably on just this factor-on having the Family Court made a division of the Federal Court. We believe that Family Court judges should be paid the same as their Federal Court colleagues rather than at much the same level as District Court judges, as is currently the case. We will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading to this effect. I would like to think it has the universal support of honourable senators in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> It had been our intention to move an amendment to put Family Court judges back into robes, with wigs as an option left to each individual judge; but the Opposition has already circulated an amendment which gives judges the right to robe, and we certainly are happy with that. From the conversations I have had with Family Court judges, giving them the right to robe is as good as making it mandatory as it seems that most of them are anxious to go back to robing, if not to wearing wigs. I certainly would not require Kemeri Murray to go into a wig. But it is appropriate that judges of the Family Court go back to robing. We will support Senator Durack's amendment on the grounds that what it does is distance the person of the judge from his or her judicial function. With a bit of luck, that will remove from the minds of some people the belief that the fact that they did not get custody or that property was divided differently from the way they wanted was some personal attack on them by the person they see in the position of judge. Maybe the disguise will not work 100 per cent, but at least it may serve to make the judge seem less accessible to some of the madder people who seem to come before the courts and feel that, if a decision goes against them, it is their right to stake out a judge's home, to attempt or to actually murder judges or their families, and, if all else fails, to kill themselves and their children. We will support the Opposition's amendment in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We also intend to support the Opposition's amendment to limit the jurisdiction of the magistrates court to property valued up to $10,000. The Government has moved a subsequent amendment to up that ceiling to $20,000. I see little reason for going as high as that and certainly we will support Senator Durack's amendment, unless for some reason the Opposition believes that there are good grounds for arguing for a limit of $20,000. I have not had the opportunity to look closely at the impact of that amendment because it was circulated only this morning. So, I have some reservations about the late amendment from the Government with regard to that $20,000 ceiling. From the quick viewing that I have been able to have of the rest of the amendment, it seems to be unexceptional. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerns have been expressed during this debate about those amendments which allow filing and hearing of divorce petitions in magistrates courts. Those concerns seem to be based on the belief that this will somehow disadvantage one or both of the parties or that magistrates should not deal with those issues or, alternatively, that the magistrates court is not the place for people who are involved in a petition for the dissolution of a marriage. With regard to the first point that somehow it will disadvantage one or both of the parties, the amendment applies to non-contested cases only. If one party wants the matter heard by the Family Court, this request must be complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> To argue that access to magistrates courts makes divorce easier to get by people who have not thought the thing through is to miss the point-and to miss the point of some very astute comments made by Senator Hill which I fully endorse. The answer is not to stop people going to magistrates courts because it might be easier for them and to make them go to the Family Court because that somehow will have a greater impact on their thinking about the dissolution of the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> We should take up the suggestion made by Senator Hill, by me and by others in this place about funding for marriage guidance counselling-not just when the marriage has got to the stage where the courts are involved, and not even after the marriage has taken place, but prior to that. It is high time we recognised that in modern society the stresses placed on marriages and the individuals within them are increasing. People need to be cautioned about the responsibilities as well as their rights within marriage. Governments, if they are going to accept any of the burden for the cost of marriage dissolution, should act early enough to prevent it happening. I certainly endorse Senator Hill's comments about the Government increasing its funding for marriage guidance, for making it better known within the community that that service is available and for encouraging people to take up that service. It seems to me that early in the rocky period of a marriage-indeed prior to the marriage-young couples, and older ones for that matter, ought to be given better counselling than they currently have. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large this Bill goes some way towards making the dissolution of marriage less traumatic for all concerned. I suggest that the fact that many of us with long and happy marriages wished that others could be as fortunate is beside the point. In my case I have been married very happily for almost 21 years, although there seems to be a belief in some quarters that the last 10 have survived only because I have been here as often as I have and that my husband has not had to tolerate some of my less amiable qualities in the last 10 years. There may be something in that, but that may well be an argument for more women going into the Parliament or the work force generally than for anything else. In any event, I have been in the happy position of having a longstanding marriage that has given me a great deal of pleasure and a great deal of support. We have two delightful teenage children who, despite the comments made 10 years ago when I first came to this place, have not yet been made wards of the state. They are a couple of teenagers whom I am very proud to call my daughters. Not everyone is able to put one's mind to working at a marriage and making it as happy and successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who are in this position ought to have some sympathy for those who are not. We ought to recognise that human beings are very frail creatures. Wise governments should accept that fact where the well-being of the community as well as the individual are concerned. In marriage we need to remember that we are dealing not just with rights but also with responsibilities; not just with adults but also with children; not just with the well-off but also with the poor; and not just with the rational but also with the irrational. The law in this area must reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation goes some additional way to doing so. It is not perfect but it does acknowledge that we are all human beings and are all subject to pressures, whether we are judges or individuals in a marriage, as adults or children of that union. With a bit of goodwill on all sides, the legislation will go some way to removing the excessive trauma and excessive cost, both emotional and financial, of the dissolution of marriages in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that people understand that since the Government has been in power it has introduced in an ad hoc fashion a number of amendments to the Family Law Act. In the past few months the Government has introduced two Bills, the first of which was introduced towards the end of last year and contained amendments that the Opposition had been suggesting for many years. Those amendments, which we suggested and which the Government introduced, said that when considering maintenance judges should not be forced to take into consideration the recipient's entitlement for the supporting parents benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1983 Senator Durack attempted to amend the Family Law Act in that fashion but the Government and the Democrats voted against it. In 1985, Senator Durack-pushing again-introduced a private member's Bill to amend the Family Law Act in that fashion. Once again the Government and the Democrats voted against it. Why was it then that towards the close of the session last year the Government suddenly saw the light and introduced amendments in exactly that fashion? The Government then voted for the Bill, naturally, and the Democrats, as usual, saw the light along with the Government and also voted for the legislation that the Opposition had been proposing since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the Bill introduced towards the end of last year but there have been many other amendments. To mention just one, the Government introduced divorce by post, purely as a cost saving exercise and the Opposition opposed that. The Government's priorities about stability of the family and attempts for reconciliation in a family breakdown are non-existent. It does not care; the only exercise it wants is cost saving and again this is coming through very clearly in the amendments before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill the House is debating today was introduced, the Opposition pointed out that the matter was very complex; that there was a lot of concern about the Family Law Act and that the Bill should go to a committee of the Senate for investigation. The Government would not permit this to occur and, again, with the support of the Democrats it voted against sending the amendments to a committee of the Senate with the result that over the Christmas break the Government saw that it was indeed more complex than it originally thought and has already-before the House has debated the Bill-introduced amendments that proved that it had never given the Bill enough thought in the beginning. I shall deal with those amendments a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Bill do? It does several things: It broadens the work of the Family Court judges; it is said, to enhance the standing of the Court. I wonder why the Court has come into such disrepute. The Government has said that the broadening of the jurisdiction of the Family Court judges will make it more attractive to the judges and will also give the existing judges some relief from the burdens of the highly emotive family law jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> It extends the Court to the jurisdiction and proceedings of bankruptcy, income tax appeals, consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act and proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. To give the judges time to enter into those new areas, it has suggested that the registrars be given additional powers. It will remove the present limitations on the powers of the judges to delegate functions to the registrars. In following this up, I shall be very interested in just how successful that will be because I view with some concern registrars being delegated powers beyond their capabilities. However, according to Senator Tate's second reading speech, this legislation will give the judges more time to concentrate on more major matters and to accept these additional judicial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Of most concern to the Opposition-I do not understand how Senator Tate could bring this into the chamber-is the fact that the Bill gives the magistrates a right, in undefended divorce cases, to take over the jurisdiction there. I do not understand how anyone could downgrade the family situation to the extent of taking it out of the Family Court, where it was originally put, so that judges who had a complete understanding of Family Court matters should look at all the cases. This Government is proposing to take out of the jurisdiction of Family Court judges the responsibility for uncontested divorce cases and give it to magistrates courts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Senator Calvert's speech, Senator Giles interjected that it would be `only the undefended cases'. However, on many occasions undefended cases involve children. It is a requirement, I remind Senator Tate, for Family Court judges to be satisfied before approving an undefended case that the arrangements made on behalf of the children are to the Court's satisfaction. I think that should be a priority of every Australian. People who want to get divorced for their own convenience will not always-although I believe they will in the majority of cases-make the arrangements for their children the top priority. It is then up to the Family Court judge to do that. Taking some of the matters relating to a divorce case, whether defended or undefended, out of the hands of the Family Court judge stops that occurring. I believe that we are entering into a very dangerous situation in that regard. As a result, we will certainly oppose that. I cannot understand how Senator Tate, of all people, can bring forward such a proposal in this chamber. At the Committee stage of the debate I will be asking questions on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech to the Bill as it was presented to us last year, before the proposed amendments were drawn up over the Christmas recess, we were told that the magistrates courts could in their jurisdiction in relation to property matters substantially increase the monetary limit to the limit set for the recovery of debt in each State. In New South Wales that is $40,000. Of course, we opposed that and said that it was too large an amount. We propose to move an amendment changing that amount to $10,000. The Government has acknowledged that it was wrong in introducing that in the legislation last year and is now proposing to move an amendment to upgrade, if one likes, that amount to $20,000 but not to do so to the limit set for debt recovery in each State because the levels set in each State are different. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment the Government proposes to move is designed to limit in some way the magistrates' jurisdiction. The proposed amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The regulations may provide that proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage may not be instituted in, or transferred to, a court of summary jurisdiction other than a prescribed court. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume that the prescribed courts will be magistrates courts with full time magistrates and not just part time magistrates. Once again, there were faults in the original Bill. If the Government had agreed to the Opposition suggestion and set up a committee to look at these things we would not now have this ad hoc, off the top of the head legislation that has had to have amendments even before reaching the Senate for debate. It really is ridiculous that the Government did not agree originally to set up a Senate committee to right the rubbishy Bill the Government originally presented to us. </PARA>

<PARA> We propose to move an amendment permitting judges of the Family Court to wear robes. I hope that Senator Haines is correct when she says that acceptance of this amendment would result in its being almost mandatory for Family Court judges to wear robes, because that is what the majority want to do. When the Labor Government first introduced the legislation preventing the wearing of robes by Family Court judges it hoped that it would make the Court more informal and bring it to the people. I can remember the debates on this very clearly. Members of the Labor Government said, `We have too much formality'. This Labor Government, as have all previous Labor governments, has always acted in this way. Indeed, Senator Coates did not want to be called `senator' in this place. He went through the charade of trying to have himself called `Mr Coates'. The Australian Labor Party does not believe in having any recognition of a position. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the result of the derobing of the Family Court judges? The result has been that people going before a judge have thought that it was just a man making decisions on what would happen to their children; that it was just a man taking away the property and giving it to the other partner. Because they think of the judge as just a man they can become very bitter. Indeed, this has resulted not only in extreme bitterness against a particular person but also in considerable violence and hundreds of thousands of dollars being spent on security for Family Court judges in particular. That has been a tragedy. I believe that when judges are robed people do not necessarily think of them as individuals but more as representatives of the law. I was delighted to find that the Australian Democrats will be supporting us in that regard because I believe that with the return of the robes the bitterness can be dissipated. I certainly hope so because it is very difficult for the judges to have to bear this personal animosity resulting from so many of their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government's introduction of the Bill has little to do with the betterment of the Court or the family situation. The Government has introduced it purely as a cost saving exercise. That has been underlined by the lack of funding for marriage counselling in the last couple of months. At one stage the Government cut the marriage guidance counselling service on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It was only after a tremendous hue and cry that we were able to get that back. If the Government is wanting to save money it should be trying to maintain family stability, not trying to cut costs by introducing divorce by post or by allowing magistrates to take over the very delicate tasks of Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great pleasure in supporting the amendments foreshadowed by Senator Durack. I am delighted that the Australian Democrats will be supporting some of those. I believe that the two amendments they have indicated they will support are very important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987. It gives me the opportunity of talking about the functions and the criticisms that have been made of the Family Court. Senator Durack referred to a number of those criticisms. He considered that most of them were inappropriate to be directed at the personnel of the Court and that, to a large extent, they ought to be directed to the law which the judges are attempting to administer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my view and the view of some of the people who have continually made representations to me, and presumably to many other members of parliament, that the judges of the Family Court are attempting to administer an unjust law. Instead of directing their concern against the individual judges and the persons who are involved in the Family Court structure, constituents should be directing their attention, quite justifiably I believe, to the law itself and to the fact that the representatives of the people have not given due consideration to the injustices that are perpetrated because of the inherent injustice of the law itself. It seems to me that the time is certainly overdue for another look at where we are at now 12 or 13 years on from the establishment of the Family Court following the passage through this Parliament of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other House the Opposition attempted to establish a committee to consider the provisions of this legislation. I would have supported such a proposal because I think it is important to enable persons who are likely to be affected in this jurisdiction to have their say through their committee system. I will deal with that shortly. But I believe that the time is ripe for a further look at the whole of the family law area and the effect that the Family Law Act has had on people's personal lives and, indeed, on the court system itself. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very fine words in the Family Law Act about the meaning of marriage and the need for people, society and government to give support for the institution of marriage. They are very fine words indeed; but much of the fine print of the legislation runs completely counter to those fine words. Indeed, the administration of this legislation by the Government runs counter to those fine words. The Federal Government has failed to give families in crisis realistic support that will help them to stick together. Honourable senators will remember the last election campaign and the theme, `Let's stick together'. What is the fundamental institution of society as stated by the Family Law Act? It is none other than marriage and the family. If the Government cannot provide the wherewithal and the support to enable the fundamental institution of society to stick together, where is its election promise? Where is its election platform? Or is it just meaningless propaganda? This is a tragedy particularly at a time when marriage breakdown is a major cause of poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of marriage breakdown to Federal taxpayers runs into $2 billion per year, and there is, of course, a greater personal cost in the trauma and grief of those directly involved. The number of divorces in the period 1976-86-I do not have the 1987 figures; I do not think they are available-was 477,381. In the same period the number of children of marriages ending in divorce was 573,517. I understand that is the first time that that figure has been provided to anyone. It is hot off the press from the Statistics Group of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. Since 1976 at least 573,517 children have been affected by marriages that have ended in divorce. That is the sort of trauma and grief that is not reflected in the cash amount, the cost burden, as it were, to the Federal taxpayer of $2 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet let us look at the sums of money that are made available to reconciliation services and to marriage education services in Australia. They are relatively paltry amounts. In the financial year 1986-87, the Government made a cut of 6 per cent in real terms in the funds for approved marriage counselling organisations. In that year it meant the closure of a number of counselling centres in metropolitan and rural areas, the retrenchment of a number of qualified counsellors trained by marriage counselling organisations, a notable increase in the waiting time for marriage counselling services, and an increase in the operating deficits of approved marriage counselling services. There was a hue and cry about that. I was unashamedly involved in that hue and cry. As Senator Walters said, there was a threat to close down two marriage counselling services on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and a number of marriage counselling services were closed throughout the length and breath of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, Senator Peter Walsh opened the conference of marriage counselling services in Western Australia and said, `Oh, there must have been some sort of mistake'. He then gave an undertaking on behalf of the Government-I know that there had been a great fight between the Attorney-General's Department and Finance on the matter-that funds would be made available and the shortfall would be taken up. As a result, additional funds were earmarked for marriage counselling organisations. I had some figures, but I just cannot lay my hands on them. However, the end result is that it still does not deal adequately with this question of money for reconciliation services. The marriage counselling reconciliation services still have shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still waiting lists of persons who are seeking the services of reconciliation counselling. Furthermore, any expansion by these services is brought about largely by the charging of fees. It is not generally known and, in fact, it is quite disconcerting to me to see that the amount of money that persons who are genuinely seeking to reconcile their differences have to pay per interview in at least one State is $30 a session. In my State of Tasmania, which I believe has the lowest rates for these services, the fee is $12 or $13 a session. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something to be said for some nominal contribution being made by the person seeking to obtain the services of reconciliation counsellors, but not to that extent. My concern is for the lower income families where there has been separation or where some difficulty is being experienced in the marriage, because those people sometimes find it difficult to have the wherewithal to go into these reconciliation counselling sessions. I make it clear here that many of the reconciliation counselling services will, in fact, attempt to waive that particular amount, but that makes them further behind in their deficits. All is not rosy in that area and the net result is that the Government is really being kind to the divorce sector, that is, to counselling for divorce, and is not supporting marriage maintenance counselling to the extent that it ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> For every $40 of taxpayers' funds spent on picking up the pieces of marriage breakdowns, only one cent is spent on support for reconciliation and marriage counselling services. That is an absolute tragedy. I believe the Government should not feel in any way that it is doing justice to that situation; in particular, the Department of Finance should not feel that way when giving consideration to estimates this year. Not only is the marriage maintenance area being neglected but also pre-marriage education is being neglected. In the last financial year the Federal Government limited its funds for the purpose of pre-marriage education to a paltry $100,000. In my State that meant that $500 was made available for pre-marriage education. What a disgrace! Is that not an indication of the way that people in the Government, or the departments which are handling finance, view these major questions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does a number of things, including seeking to transfer to courts of summary jurisdiction, as prescribed, certain areas of divorce. That is an area which I believe trivialises marriage and should be opposed. I hope it will be opposed in this chamber, and I shall say more about that at the committee stage. I have listened with interest to the speakers who have preceded me. I believe it was Senator Reid who said that the work of the Family Court was possibly more stressful than that of other courts. I believe we should understand that, but we should make sure that the blame is placed where it belongs-that is, here, and not on the personnel of the Court. The blame can also be placed on the administration of the counselling area because largely the court counselling service is given over to divorce counselling and not reconciliation counselling. </PARA>
<PARA> When the committee stage is reached, further discussion will be held, and I shall leave to that particular stage my comments on the trivialisation of marriage that is inherent in the proposed legislation. In the meantime, I hope the Government does not sit back and say that it has done a good job on the further money that has been granted to reconciliation counselling services because, as I am advised, that is not dealing with the problem in the fashion it deserves to be dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987. The Bill is the companion of the Family Law (Amendment) Bill of 1987, which was debated in the Senate in the dying days of the last session of Parliament and which, sadly, did not get the full ventilation that it thoroughly deserved. Debates on family law legislation such as this and, by necessity, divorce always attract subjectivity and are invariably of a fixed and emotional nature. During my last address on this proposed legislation, I touched on the matters that were raised by Senator Harradine, very properly, in a very articulate way today. It appears that the Government seems to spend too much money at the wrong end of the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general terms, the Bill proposes three changes to the Family Law Act of 1975. The first, by clause 9, allows Family Court judges to make rules of court delegating to judicial registrars all the powers of the Court. Next, the Bill extends the jurisdiction of magistrates courts to include undefended applications for dissolution of marriage and increases the level of the value of property for which applications may be instituted directly in such courts of summary jurisdiction. Finally, the legislation seeks to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Family Court by allowing judges to deal with a variety and a collection of subject matters not otherwise within the Court's specialist jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons behind these changes are obvious: the administration of family law by a separate specialist court simply has not worked. The Family Court, by any objective measure, in its present form is simply a failure. That there have been problems in attracting judges to the Family Court cannot be doubted. Mr Justice Kirby, for instance, has commented on a number of occasions that there is within the profession a condescending attitude towards family law practitioners and the standing of the Family Court. Where such an attitude prevails amongst the profession, it is surely asking too much of the ordinary Australian to have any great confidence in the operation of the Court and the family law system. The former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, also commented on the deficiencies of the Family Court in an address to the Australian Legal Convention in 1985. He said that the creation of that Court had made it difficult to maintain high standards in the making of judicial appointments. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> Past experience in Australia does not support the view that specialized experience is necessary to render a judge able to deal with matters of family law. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely the best solution to the many problems of the Family Court is to transfer the jurisdiction either to the State Supreme Courts, for example, or to a division of the Federal Court. Indeed, the report of the Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission on the Australian Judicial System, otherwise known as the Jackson Committee, indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> In retrospect, there was much to be said for vesting Federal family law jurisdiction in State family courts on the Western Australian model. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court of Western Australia, as we all know, is unique in that it is the only State family court established under section 41 of the Family Law Act. By being a State court it has been able conveniently to administer both the State and Commonwealth law and it has avoided many of the judicial and practical problems which have resulted where part of a family court is covered by Federal law and where part is covered by State legislation. To the best of my knowledge there has been no view to the contrary that the Family Court of Western Australia has been a great success. Yet it is interesting to note that, with the exception of the chairman of the judges, all judges in the Family Court of Western Australia are equal in status to the judges of the District Court of Western Australia. In the event, however, the Jackson Committee thought it inappropriate that jurisdiction be transferred to the States. I think that is a view that is held by many, for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee did not actually recommend a particular course of action for reconstructing the Family Court, in its final report it did tentatively adopt an option in its statement of preliminary views in February 1987. The Committee suggested that the preferred course would be to renovate, to re-equip and to further staff the Family Court to a level appropriate to that of a Federal superior court so that at some time in the future it could be reborn as a new division of the Federal Court. Whether the jurisdiction of the Family Court is transferred to the States or whether it becomes a part of the Family Court, it is my view that some positive action must be taken, or at least after a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is certainly pointless to take bandaid, remedial action with the Family Court as it presently stands when proper and urgent reform is clearly necessary. The entire jurisdiction needs re-examining. The better solution, of course, if the Federal Court proposal is to be accepted, is surely to transfer the jurisdiction now and to restructure the Federal Court generally along the lines suggested by the Jackson Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the particular changes which are proposed in the Bill. Clause 9 of the Bill proposes the creation of a new office of the judicial registrar, who will be delegated all or any powers of the Court. The judicial registrars will fulfil a role similar to that presently being performed by masters in the State Supreme Courts. In my opinion the use of judicial registrars is basically sound because it will allow speedier resolution of many quite important interlocutory matters which are currently being handled by judges and will leave the judges freer to deal with the more complex litigation. There are, however, some aspects of concern in relation to the appointment of the judicial registrars. The first relates to the fact that they, as I have mentioned, will be delegated all or any powers of the Court. Although the stated aim of the creation of the new office is to enable judges to be free of minor and procedural matters, the wording of the proposed section 26b makes it plain that any matter within the jurisdiction can be delegated to the judicial registrars. Notwithstanding that the rules of the Court delegating these powers are subject to the normal powers of disallowance procedures applicable to statutory regulations, it is quite possible that these judicial registrars could be called upon to determine very complex issues of law which they simply may not be legally qualified-or at least qualified in any measure-to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 26f amplifies the seriousness of the way in which section 26b is drafted in that it proposes that a judicial registrar is not subject to the direction or control of any person or body in the exercise of the power delegated under section 26b (1). I have always held the view that once power is delegated there ought not to be interference in the application of the delegated power. However, I make that point in highlighting the powers that can be transferred to these judicial registrars. It is also of concern to me that under proposed section 26 the judicial registrars are able to be appointed for specified and specific terms not exceeding seven years although, of course, they are eligible for reappointment. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision, in my view, has the capacity of casting a shadow over the integrity and independence that these judicial registrars must have if they are to be accorded their proper respect from the profession and the participants, which is so vital if they are to fulfil their functions properly and effectively. For them to be engaged virtually at Her Majesty's pleasure and to be subject to perhaps perceived political appointments is bad in principle and will hinder the success of any Family Court restructuring. It is quite ludicrous that under proposed section 26n judicial registrars shall hold office under such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Governor-General. The only terms and conditions upon which they are appointed ought to be set out in a clear way in the legislation before us. This is real `trust me' legislation and it is something that in relation to this Government we ought not to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to that part of the Bill which extends the family law powers of courts of summary jurisdiction, I will comment on the provision contained in new subsection 46 (1) (b). This provision seeks to allow proceedings to be instituted in magistrates courts with respect to property with a value exceeding the amount in relation to which the court has jurisdiction in an action for the recovery of a debt. Currently, of course, proceedings for property can be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction without consent only when the value of the property does not exceed $1,000. I say at the outset that I am totally opposed to increasing the jurisdiction at present given to State magistrates courts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite plain-and I think the view is held by most people-that merely because a proceeding involves a relatively small financial amount, that does not mean that the matter may not be complex. For example, under section 79 of the Family Law Act any court making an order in proceedings in respect of property is required to take into account a wide range of matters, including all of those matters considered for maintenance applications under subsection 75 (2). With due respect, and without in any way denigrating courts of summary jurisdiction, I suggest that when magistrates are deciding proceedings for property which does not exceed $1,000 in value, they would be less concerned with the finer points of the Family Law Act and perhaps less reticent to make final orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal contained in the present Bill seeks to give magistrates jurisdiction in property matters to the value of the summary court's present debt jurisdiction. That amount can vary. In Queensland it is $5,000 and in Victoria it is $40,000. I will touch on the practical consequences shortly. Pegging the property jurisdiction to the particular magistrates court's debt level is completely arbitrary and totally contradicts the fact that the Family Law Act is by any measure supposed to be a uniform Federal law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Tate. On a practical level I have no hesitation in suggesting that, by so tying jurisdiction, the complexity of the Family Law Act will play a far greater role in determining whether a magistrate makes the proper order or whether the proceedings are transferred back to the Family Court. It ought to be noted that the magistrate has an option under subsection 46 (1) (b) to the effect that instead of transferring the proceedings to the Family Court he may send the proceedings back to the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which he has jurisdiction. I suppose it is a matter for him to judge whether to transfer it back to the Family Court or to the Supreme Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is plain that magistrates, through no fault of their own, simply do not have the prerequisite experience or knowledge to deal with complex issues which often arise in property proceedings. If this proposal goes ahead, there is no doubt that many more property applications will be transferred back to the Family Court, as magistrates simply will not be willing to take the responsibility of applying what by any measure can be judged to be complex considerations of the Family Law Act when considerably higher money values are at stake. Consequently, the primary purpose for using courts of summary jurisdiction in the first place-that is, to provide for speedier resolution-may have the reverse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final point on this aspect of the Bill. This proposal is quite ludicrous when one considers the circumstances surrounding application of the law in a town such as Albury-Wodonga. I do not know whether anyone has mentioned in the debate that that township is divided by the River Murray. Victoria is on one side and New South Wales is on the other and the jurisdiction varies, depending on which side of the river one lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to speak today to respond to some remarks made in the Joint Sitting by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney. I thought the remarks he made were in some ways quite extraordinary and not appropriate for a Joint Sitting, but I think they did indicate the frustration of the Liberal Party. In particular, his remarks related to the fact that the Australian Labor Party is selecting party bureaucrats, namely, State and Federal secretaries, to become senators. He named in particular Senator Richardson, Senator Beahan, myself and of course Senator McMullan, suggesting that this was some extraordinary indication that the Australian Labor Party was out of touch with the public. I think that indicates that Senator Chaney and the Liberal Party have a great sense of frustration that over the last decade or more people such as Senator Richardson, Senator Beahan, Senator McMullan and me have been extremely successful in organising election campaigns that have defeated the Liberal Party. If one went through and counted the number of election campaigns that the four of us have been involved in organising and directing since we became full time officials of the Party in the mid-1970s one would find that our track record is for me personally a very proud one, and it is certainly a record the others would be proud of. I would think between us we have probably won 15 to 20 Federal and State elections and by-elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it indicates further that Senator Chaney is rather spooked by the fact that he has to sit opposite and see on the Government benches people who have helped in the demise of the Liberal Party and helped to defeat it. The fact is that not since October 1980 has the Liberal Party won either a State or a Federal election on mainland Australia. It is an indication that Senator Chaney accepts the fact that no longer is the Liberal Party the natural government of Australia or a majority of the States. It was interesting to note the enthusiasm of Liberal Party members during the Joint Sitting because of their success in the Adelaide by-election. That did remind me of what the Labor Party was like in the 1950s and 1960s when we lost election after election and at one stage were not the government of any State, let alone at the Federal level. When we occasionally won a by-election we took it as a great victory. But the thing is, after a by-election, when you wake up next morning with a hangover the other side is still the government. That is the case now. We may have lost the Adelaide by-election but the fundamental position is still that the Australian Labor Party is the Government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, Senator Chaney made a sort of psychological slip during the Joint Sitting, and in fact he was virtually giving the game away because of the frustration resulting from the fact that the Liberal Party is a long-term Opposition. The Liberals will have momentary successes; politics is like that. But the fundamentals have changed in Australian politics and the Liberal Party's domination again in Australia is a long, long way off-if it happens at all. </PARA>
<PARA> One is reminded of the extraordinary events during the last 12 months, when the 78-year-old geriatric Premier of Queensland destroyed the coalition in three days. He ruined any chance it may have had to win the last election, and we had the bizarre spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, going to Brisbane to plead with this old man, `Please don't attack us, please don't ruin my chances of becoming Prime Minister'. Of course the Premier of Queensland dismissed Mr Howard in a matter of seconds. The fact that a 78-year-old geriatric who could not put more than three sentences together without tripping over himself could destroy the coalition so effectively shows the impotence of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has to face it: it is in an extraordinarily difficult situation. The Liberal Party created by Alfred Deakin 60-odd years ago is not the Liberal Party of today. The Liberal Party of Sir Robert Menzies is not the Liberal Party of today. I think that is sinking into many members of the Liberal Party, not the least being John Elliott, who only recently said that at the last election the Liberal Party was not fit to govern. However, I am not a great advocate of John Elliott. I really do not think the Australian people would see John Elliott as a potential Prime Minister. I think they will draw the line at having a can of Fosters beer representing the leadership of the Liberal Party and particularly the leadership of Australia. But he did have the honesty to state very strongly his opinion about the weakness of the Liberal Party. Though in many ways I am pleased that Senator Chaney took the opportunity, in the historic Joint Sitting, only the second that has taken place, I understand, since Australia's Federation--</PARA>

I take it as a great honour that he believed we needed to be attacked and abused, and he called us, in a pejorative way, apparatchiks. I am proud of the term `apparatchik' because of the success I helped bring to the Labor Party. I noticed Andrew Peacock called Mr McMullan, now Senator McMullan, a kneecapper. The only people Bob McMullan kneecapped were in the Liberal Party. He did it for three Federal elections in a row. We think he did a superb job on behalf of the Labor Party. I know the Liberal Party would not agree with that. Liberal Party members may not think party officials are appropriate, and they may well be right if they look at their own party officials. I look forward to the day when the Liberal Party looks at putting Tony Eggleton in the Senate. Having lost three elections in a row, will he be suitably qualified for this place? Other Liberal State directors have not seemed to make it here, other than, I think, Mr Carlton, who did not have great success as shadow Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, Madam Acting Deputy President, I thought Senator Chaney psychologically gave the game away and I was trying to think of what sort of image he has of people such as Senator Richardson, myself, Senator Beahan and now Senator McMullan. The only thing I could think of was that maybe he sees us as the equivalent of the four horsemen of the apocalypse as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. I am not great on mythology, but as I understand it the four horsemen represent four things. The first horseman represents conquest. I would certainly say that the four former Labor Party party secretaries now in this House have certainly conquered the Liberal Party on more occasions than we have been conquered by them. The second horseman represents war. In the political war, our success has been outstanding. The Liberal Party has lost that war. The third horseman represents famine. Certainly, in the definition of political success, there has been a long famine for the Liberal Party. The final horseman represents death. As I said earlier, the Liberal Party is in its own internal death throes. So I think it is very appropriate to draw the analogy the four horsemen of the apocalypse in relation to the Liberal Party. I hope Senator Chaney enjoys in the years ahead looking across the table at Senator Richardson, Senator Beahan, Senator McMullan and me and being reminded of the success that we have obtained for the Labor Party and the lack of success the Liberal Party has had. </PARA>

Is the Minister aware that in an article appearing in the Hobart Mercury on 15 February the honourable member for Franklin, Mr Bruce Goodluck, is quoted as having said, `I will not support my party if they are going to give an inch to the conservationists.'? I will end the quote there; I will not be so unkind as to repeat what he said about Senator Puplick. Given that the Tasmanian Liberal Government has adopted in the past a similar attitude to Mr Goodluck's, is the Minister concerned that the current discussions being held with the Tasmanian Government, aimed at protecting National Estate values in the Douglas-Apsley region of Tasmania, will not be approached in a constructive manner? Is the Minister prepared to discuss the matter with the Federal Opposition Leader, John Howard, and the environment spokesman, Senator Puplick, prior to any decision being made?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well aware of divisions within the Opposition on the question of balancing the competing demands of conservation and development. Those divisions have lasted a long time and will last a lot longer. Senator Puplick's desperate and cynical attempt to turn the Liberals green will just not wash. No redneck like Bruce Goodluck will ever turn green. No National Party member will ever adhere to the new Puplick line on conservation. The Government is proceeding in good faith to discuss the problems in the Douglas-Apsley area with the Tasmanian Government. We have been considering the final management plan for the Douglas-Apsley region. My comment on that plan will be conveyed to my Tasmanian counterpart. If there are any unresolved problems, I have the right and responsibility to seek a formal consultation with Mr Groom. I reserve my position on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has no wish and no plan to start a confrontation with the Tasmanian Government on this issue. We want to examine the case on its merits. We want to balance competing claims and we want to take the best decision for Tasmania and for all Australians. In this process we would welcome constructive comment from the Opposition, but we have no reason to hope that any such constructive comment will be forthcoming. The Opposition's policy on conservation and development has been to put up for sale to the highest bidder. The Opposition has never developed a coherent or comprehensive policy. It has never addressed the basic principles involved, and it has never thought out the goals it should be pursuing. When it does, and when it wants to make a mature contribution to the debate, we will be prepared to listen.</PARA>

I believe the display was seen by you, Mr President, and I think also by Senator Bruce Childs and other members of a recent delegation to the United States of America. I also understand that the creators of the display have been unable to reconfirm the Australian map because the United States Government told them that the information was `classified'.

I can say absolutely and unequivocally that any suggestion that nuclear weapons are located in Western Australia, or indeed anywhere in Australia, is absolutely and totally incorrect. Australia does not, of course, produce nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. We are firmly committed to the Treaty for the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. Under the South Pacific Treaty parties undertake, among other things, not to manufacture or otherwise acquire, possess or have control over any nuclear explosive device and to prevent in their territory the stationing of any nuclear explosive device. It is very difficult to know what on earth the map references or light bulbs could possibly be referring to.

In order to provide a considered Government response to the Royal Commissioner's report, and the submissions from the Vietnam Veterans Association, the previous Minister for Veterans' Affairs, as Senator McLean is well aware, engaged a ministerial consultant to assist in preparing proposals to go forward to Cabinet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the allegations concerning the injection of penguins with radioactive material. It is important to note that it is very dilute radioactive isotopes of which we speak-sodium 22, I am told. They have been used in research on penguins to study the efficiency with which they can convert food to energy. They are widely used for biological, medical and other scientific research purposes around the world. It is hardly a new procedure. It is used in all of Australia, including Antarctica. The current studies are on a small scale. They involve 15 adult penguins and 15 chicks from a rookery of 30,000 Emperor penguins near our Mawson station. There are very low levels of radioactivity present, so low that they cannot be detected against the background of natural radiation after 10 days. I am reliably informed that no harm is being done to the penguins-the penguins have not told me that yet but the scientists involved say so-and that no damage is being done to their rookeries or to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I have said that this procedure is not new and is a widely used technique around the world there is public concern about the injection of the penguins.

I also spoke to them about some other possibly related matters and I believe appropriate inquiries, to the extent that they have not already been put in process, will be set in train as a result of that.

Given the fact that 41 per cent of those polled were against the mining and export of uranium, with only 39 per cent in favour, is this not indicative of the way in which the Labor Government has lost touch with the voters by either changing or ignoring its policies, as it did by exporting uranium to France? Will the Government now make an effort to return to its original principled position and ban the mining and export of uranium altogether, or will the Government at least refuse to give in to pressure from certain elements in the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia who want to alienate further their traditional supporters, as well as Aboriginal people and conservationists, by opening up a third uranium mine at Rudall River?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of phrases in that question which I, as Minister, reject. I have seen the Press report-in fact I have a copy of it here-of the survey to which Senator Vallentine has referred. The first distinction I make is that I have read only the Press report; I have not seen the survey, and I do not propose to base any considerations on what the Press say about a report which I have not seen. I prefer to look at the source material. However, on what we know from the Press report, a number of observations can be made. In considering what is said in the report, there appears to have been some confusion in the minds of the respondents in that on the surface a number of contradictory replies appear to have been given. For example, the Press report cites 67 per cent of the respondents as being in favour of a defence relationship with the United States of America. It also cites 42 per cent of the respondents as approving of United States bases in Australia, while 37 per cent do not. I am not suggesting that those figures are at odds with the figures cited by Senator Vallentine, but they do throw up a number of other considerations relating to what the respondents thought they were responding to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This leads me to the second observation from what appeared in the Press; that is, that I do not know what was the phraseology used or the terms of the questions put to the respondents. Until I have that before me, I do not know how it invites a response. But what I do know-this is apparent from the Press-is that the question on uranium exports followed a series of questions dealing with nuclear weapons, foreign bases or French tests. Taken in the context of that series of questions, it sets up a mind set in the respondent to regard exports of Australian uranium overseas as being somehow related to weapons and military use rather than to civil, energy or medical use. If it is being argued here that that mind set ought to apply, we as a government absolutely reject it. We as a government have insisted that Australian uranium exported overseas be used only in civil power generation. In order to enforce that, we have required countries receiving Australian uranium to adopt a comprehensive set of safeguards aimed at preventing the diversion of that uranium into military use. In terms of the way in which those questions were answered, we reject that there is any association between the peaceful use of Australian uranium as a fuel in the energy cycle and the military implications in the series of questions that appeared in the article referred to by Senator Vallentine.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of Senator Vallentine's question related to Rudall River, which is a national park in the north-west of Western Australia, and to a uranium deposit known more properly as the Kintyre deposit.

The question was: Why is stereotyping of women more offensive in advertising than in the other areas I listed? In her response, the Minister indicated that the Government is concerned about sex stereotyping of women in the media. You, Mr President, and even members of the Government will understand that that is far broader than simply the advertising industry. My question concerns cartoons such as this Leunig cartoon, which informs men that if they want to look up a woman's skirt, they ought to avoid back injury by carrying a mirror on a stick. Is Senator Reynolds a bit blind? I have a bigger copy for her. Why is the Minister not concerned about that cartoon yet concerned about advertising? This is the media. That is the question: Why is the Minister concerned about or trying to do something about sex stereotyping in advertising and not in the rest of the media? Is not the answer: because the Minister knows that she is trying to censor free expression?</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: Does the Minister agree that he, his office and the Federal Police all knew about the existence of this document and yet on two occasions, firstly in answer to Senator Tambling on 14 December and then in response to the Opposition's freedom of information (FOI) request, he did not acknowledge its existence? Even if the Minister asks us to believe that his office did not retain a copy of the document, how can he possibly explain the failure to mention it on these occasions? Is the reason that to acknowledge its existence would have indicated that the Federal Police advice had to be qualified in some way and that would have cast doubt on his definite assertion that the police had never had any reservations about Dr Stanley Ho's connection with Federal Hotels Ltd-in other words, to disclose it would have revealed that he did indeed mislead the Senate on 14 December?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not mislead the Senate on 14 December in the way that has been suggested. The fact is that when I came into the Senate chamber on that date I had the brief of 14 September and 30 November, though I must admit that at the time this was raised on 2 and 3 February and right up until 11 February I had no recollection of the form in which I had an additional notation to help me give a full answer, consistent with confidentiality as advised to me, to the Senate. In other words, quite frankly, after the answer on 14 December I thought no more about the matter until it was raised on 2 February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would appear that at the end of the session my particular parliamentary question brief was culled and the note provided for me in order to give that full answer to the Senate was disposed of in the culling. But it appears that the AFP had the brief of 14 September obviously, the brief of 30 November as returned by me with a notation, and the two documents which were aids to me in giving the answer. In fact, had I known of their existence on 2 February I think I would have been helped in the preparation of my defence, if you like to put it that way, in that I could have asserted, as I was able to do during the censure motion, that indeed Chief Superintendent Whiddett and my Senior Private Secretary had composed an answer for me in order to abide by the advice given to me as to confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA> But it was only on Thursday, I think it was, 11 February-possibly late in the day, but I do not suppose that is relevant-that the AFP informed my office that in trying to fulfil an FOI request for documents relating to this matter it had found the 30 November brief with my notation and the two documents which, as I say, were the form of words which I used to the Senate chamber. I was very happy that it had and therefore, of course, when I rose to make my statement in answer to the censure motion, I made them available to the Senate, as I understood them to be being made available to the FOI inquirer.

That is the first part of the question. The second part is in relation to the freedom of information application which was referred to the police.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will know that when Ministers come into the chamber they have their briefs, though mine were not in the form of parliamentary questions, available to them. Quite often I come in with shorthand notes, handwritten notes and little pieces of paper which are an aid to my giving an answer. That is what I had when I gave my answer to Senator Tambling. It is quite clear that, in fact, what I apparently used in the course of that answer was indeed those two additional documents, one of which Chief Superintendent Whiddett had put together and brought over on 10 December, the other of which was put together in the office between Chief Superintendent Whiddett and my Senior Private Secretary. I had them as aids to be able to give an answer. I did not regard them as the briefs which I had from the Office of the Australian Federal Police. They were the primary documents; the others were composed in order to enable me to give the response which I did. I did not regard them in any way as having the same status as those briefs which I had. They were aids to me to give a full answer. As such, they were just available to me and I used them. As to the question of my response to the FOI request, on 20 January 1988 I wrote to Mr Fryar, care of Mr Cowan, MP-I think this must be the relevant freedom of information request-saying the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to your request of 14 December 1987 under the Freedom of Information Act to the Australian Federal Police seeking access to documents relating to the Christmas Island Casino, Federal Hotels and Dr Stanley Ho.</PARA>
<PARA> Your request was transferred to my Office by the AFP on 23 December 1987. The transfer was in accordance with your request, but, of course, did not apply regarding documents in my possession which originated with the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> A thorough check of my Office-</PARA>
<PARA>this was made, obviously, in early January-</PARA>
<PARA>has disclosed only two documents relating to this matter: both documents originated with the AFP and both dealt with their investigation into Federal Hotels Limited-</PARA>
<PARA>obviously the 14 September and 30 November briefs-</PARA>
<PARA>The AFP will have copies of these which will be dealt with in their reply to your request. There are no other documents in my possession that come within the terms of your request.</PARA>
<PARA>We had no other documents, they had obviously been either culled from the question file-this supplementary note that I had in order to assist in my answer-or in their original form had been taken back by the AFP after the question, but I think they had their own copy. My Press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Senator Michael Tate, today rejected suggestions that he had not properly complied with the Freedom of Information Act in relation to documents concerning the Christmas Island casino.</PARA>
<PARA> My response to the request was correct as to all relevant documents in existence and in my possession at that date.</PARA>
<PARA> These were the copies of the official briefs from the Australian Federal Police of 14 September and 30 November.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no obligation under the FOI Act to disclose documents which came into my possession subsequent to the response.</PARA>
<PARA>I only became aware of them on 11 February.</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the other documents which he tabled on February 16 were not held in his office at the time of the FOI request.</PARA>
<PARA> Copies of them were provided to Senator Tate on February 11 by the Australian Federal Police for clearance, prior to their release by the AFP to complete the FOI request by Mr Ray Braithwaite, MP.</PARA>
<PARA> These two remaining documents were speaking notes, prepared for question time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, for about a week, been trying to get information about particular Australian companies that would shed light on the effects on those specific companies of the changes proposed for New Zealand as against the system in Australia. I have not yet been able to get information relating to particular companies, but there is enough information available to draw some conclusions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before going on to that, the whole question of international comparisons in tax rates is a complex one. The Australia-New Zealand comparison is no exception to that. The question of the tax rate applying in any country is only one of the factors which would be taken into account by potential investors in making a decision as to where to locate investment if they have that choice, demonstrated by the fact that the tax rate is irrelevant with profits of zero. At a level of profit twice as high in one country as it is or it could be in another country and a tax rate twice as high is a question that is irrelevant and, assuming again that the rate is irrelevant, other factors such as the rates of inflation, wage increases, interest rates and expectation as to where all those things are going in the future would also be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> What I do want to give some information on here is the fact that some people who have looked at the proposed New Zealand changes have ignored the changes to the taxation base and there are many of them, but I want to mention one in particular. The New Zealand package includes the imposition of a fringe benefits tax (FBT) at the rate of 24 per cent on employer contributions to superannuation funds, a de facto payroll tax which will vary in accordance with the percentage of salary paid by employers into superannuation funds. For example, if an employer paid 10 per cent of salary into a superannuation fund, the de facto payroll tax is almost 2 1/2 per cent and contributions of 10 per cent and even higher are not all that uncommon. Therefore, that is a factor which would be taken into account by any rational investor. The degree to which that FBT on superannuation contributions was a deterrent to investment in New Zealand would be a function of the ratio of wages to the capital base of a company and also of the level of superannuation contributions as a percentage of wages.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been provided with information which shows that if the company tax rate in Australia had been 20 percentage points lower in 1984-85-the reductions proposed in New Zealand are reductions of 15 per cent or 20 per cent, depending upon whether the investor is a domestic resident or not-and companies had had to pay the 24 per cent fringe benefits tax on their contributions to superannuation funds, just over 18 per cent of all Australian companies, public and private, would have paid more tax than they did without that broadening of the base of the FBT on superannuation contributions and the lower rate.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that the provision of superannuation has almost certainly significantly increased since 1984-85 we can be reasonably certain that at least that number of Australian companies would actually be worse off if the proposed New Zealand regime were to apply here.</PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is that a number of knee jerk and woolly thinkers responded immediately to the New Zealand announcement by saying that the financial services-such as banking, consultancy and that sort of thing; industries where geographic location is not particularly important-can easily be transferred across international borders and we would all pack up and leave Australia for New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I have not been able to get specific information about companies yet, but some of the attributes of the financial services of that industry are a relatively narrow equity base because capital investment is not particularly high, a fairly high wages base or a wage bill relative to that and relatively generous superannuation arrangements; in other words, the very type of business most likely to be deterred from locating in New Zealand because of the FBT on employer superannuation contributions.</PARA>

<PARA> I respect Senator Harradine's personal attitude in relation to abortion. However, I point out that any trial of this drug would have to be within the law of the relevant State or Territory and would also be subject to approval by the ethics committee of the institutions where the trials were being conducted. The Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health and the Minister, Dr Blewett, have informed me that an early decision will not be taken on the application for clinical trials of the drug for the purposes of legal early termination of pregnancy. In considering the application for clinical trials all data, including overseas evidence, will be carefully considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during Question Time, Senator Newman asked me a question relating to an answer I gave on 26 October 1987. Understandably, I could not recollect the exact terms of my answer on that date and I undertook to give Senator Newman a fuller answer after I had read the relevant part of Hansard. The question asked of me by Senator Newman on 26 October 1987 invited me to recollect an interview on the Four Corners program on 21 September 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The transcript of that interview reveals that my contribution dealt with Mr Parker in particular and the role of National Crime Authority liaison officers and commissioners of police generally. Senator Newman then purported to quote my words from the interview, amongst others, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when the stench of corruption reaches so high that the work the National Crime Authority may have been compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>Although Senator Newman has allowed the Hansard to be published with her attributing this quotation to me, they are not, of course, the exact words I used on the Four Corners program. To that extent it is Senator Newman who, in purporting to quote, presumably having the transcript of the interview, deliberately, knowingly or mischievously misled the Senate. What I actually said on that program was:</PARA>
<PARA> Well it does fill me with some foreboding and naturally I share the concern of all citizens when the stench of corruption reaches so high, but particularly in this particular instance where you have Mr Parker as liaison officer attending three operational conferences conducted by the National Crime Authority over the space of a year, my fears I think are well grounded, and for that reason I have asked Mr Justice Stewart to carry out an investigation to examine whether indeed the operations of the National Crime Authority were compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `so high' in the clause, `when the stench of corruption reaches so high'. That was my immediate response to Andrew Olle's question to me as follows, `Senator Tate in Canberra'-that was his first question:</PARA>
<PARA> I imagine you must be very concerned about this because of course the man in Queensland, Assistant Commissioner Parker, was the liaison officer for the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Newman's question that had a preamble which purported to quote me out of the Four Corners interview did not exactly quote and give the full context of that clause. Nevertheless, obviously it triggered the memory of the question and answer in my mind.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the first part of the question put to me by Senator Newman on 26 October 1987 related to Mr Parker. I therefore answered in terms of Mr Parker's role as liaison officer in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> In general I can assure the chamber and, indeed, those who are listening, that the National Crime Authority's operations and the protection of its witnesses-a point particularly raised by Senator Hill in a question a couple of weeks ago-has, as far as one can judge and on advice available to me from Mr Justice Stewart, not been compromised by the events surrounding, in particular, Mr Parker in his role as liaison officer with the National Crime Authority over several years.</PARA>
<PARA>In my answer on 26 October 1987 I went on to indicate the steps I had taken to try to ensure no repetition of this vulnerable situation for the National Crime Authority. Although Senator Newman in her question of 17 November 1987 sought to belittle those proposals, the National Crime Authority, police commissioners and the committee of Ministers thought otherwise. I can report to the Senate that those foreshadowed changes were adopted by the National Crime Authority Inter-governmental Committee on 25 November 1987. The answer I gave was therefore in direct response to the questions posed to me by Senator Newman. Her implication yesterday that she had not asked about Mr Parker is simply not correct in terms of the Four Corners interview which she chose to quote, or purported to quote. I could interpret her question no other way and I resent the inference that I had misled the Senate in my answer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-During Question Time, Senator Michael Baume asked Senator Gareth Evans a question which followed up a question I asked yesterday about the Sydney waterfront and the very serious backlogs which are being experienced in Sydney and which are affecting individual businesses and industries throughout Australia. Senator Evans said during his answer that I had asked this question yesterday and he also said that it was `unfortunate that the Opposition was concentrating on the issue of corruption' or words to that effect. The reality of the situation is that the question which I addressed to Senator Evans yesterday raised a series of concerns relating to the delays on the waterfront. The question related to the fact that there was a nine-week backlog which was putting small companies out of business. I referred to the fact that the backlog appeared to be getting progressively worse. I referred to allegations about bribes and I asked whether they had been investigated. I asked about industrial disputes and restrictive union work practices, particularly in relation to working hours and limits on the number of unpacks, which I stated were greatly exacerbating efforts to move the backlog, and I asked generally what action the Government has taken or whether it is a matter within the responsibility of the Unsworth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just wanted to make the point, Mr President, that it was quite clear from my question that the Opposition has a wide range of concerns, I have a wide range of concerns, and I believe all those issues which I have raised are relevant to the quite serious problems which we face in Sydney. The reason for a follow-up question today on the narrower issue of corruption was that the Minister totally failed to address himself to that part of my question in his original answer and I had to ask a supplementary question, at which point the Minister advised us that he would that afternoon consult with the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). It seemed in those circumstances to the Opposition and to Senator Michael Baume in particular that it was desir- able to find out what had transpired from the matters which the Minister indicated yesterday. I want to make it quite clear that, contrary to what was said by Senator Evans, the concerns which I raised yesterday were not on the narrow question-important as it is-of corruption on the waterfront--</PARA>

Unfortunately, the Minister's answer referred to months: he talked about reports in March and later this year. I simply express my personal concern that this situation requires immediate action as well as the longer term action which has been indicated by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point of misrepresentation I would not have risen on were it a sole point, but I think the two together help to illustrate the difficulties of an Opposition in responding to matters raised by Ministers in Question Time. In response to some very rowdy interjections by me as to whether Senator Walsh was a coward, he made the point that I was a wimp because I had refused to take certain action in Adelaide at our last federal executive meeting. The simple reality is that I was in New Zealand on the day of our last federal executive meeting and was therefore unable to take part. I would not normally have made a personal explanation on this point, given that I was being extremely rude, and intentionally so, to Senator Walsh in response to what I felt was his quite unpardonable behaviour, but I make the point that it is difficult, Mr President, when your rulings, which are consistent with previous Presidents' rulings-that it is not for you to say in what manner Ministers will answer questions-leave oppositions in a difficult position when misrepresentations of fact are contained in Ministers' answers. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first opportunity I have had during our Bicentenary to provide honourable senators with a progress report on a significant bicentennial project-the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to report that the project is on schedule for the official opening by Her Majesty the Queen on 9 May 1988. The first in a series of major handovers of parts of the building took place, as planned, on 18 January when significant areas of the northern and central zones were consigned to the care and custody of the Parliament. Together they represent about one third of the total floorspace and include the Foyer, the Great Hall, the Members' Hall, the Queen's Terrace, some parliamentary offices on the ground floor, the public circulation areas, some Members' suites and the main kitchens and security accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the handover, tests started on lighting around the entrance and along the curved and sloping walls at the northern end of the building. Work on the project is proceeding in accordance with the timetable for the handover of other areas from early March. </PARA>
<PARA> As in the past I will also provide a budget update for the project for the three months period from June to August 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised building budget for the three months to August 1987 now stands at $879.22 million, with another $168.58 million for non building items. </PARA>
<PARA> The total project budget is therefore increased from $1026.9 million at May 1987 prices to $1047.8 million at August 1987 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This updating includes $7.91 million for the effects of inflation in the three months period. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional components have been an allowance to cover the cost of industrial disputes, insolvencies of contractors and reinstatement of previously deferred or deleted works such as landscaping-costs outside the control of the Parliament House Construction Authority, i.e., $4.05m, $1.74m and $7.2m respectively, a total of $12.99m. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in my previous report to you that we are looking to unions and contractors for their full co-operation and commitment to achieve substantial completion on target for the May opening and for the building to be operational in August. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators can see from the report, some 11 short weeks before Her Majesty opens the new Parliament House, there can be no doubt about its readiness for the event. This could only have happened with the co-operation and commitment that the Minister asked for and which has so obviously been given. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report to which the Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has referred is a progress report on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) on the new Parliament House and a budget update for the three months ending August 1987. I note in particular that point: it is a budget update for the period only to the end of August 1987. Therefore, the financial side of the report is almost six months out of date. I find that strange and worrying with such a short period to go before the completion of the building and, as is said in the report, with only 11 weeks to the official opening of it by Her Majesty the Queen. I will come back to that a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, I welcome the progress report. This report is part of a regular series of reports that the Minister for Administrative Services has been making to the Parliament on the progress of the new Parliament House. I welcome the Minister saying in his statement that the project is `on schedule for the official opening by Her Majesty the Queen on 9 May'. Later in the report-I will come back to this in slightly different words later-it states that the building will be operational in August. All senators who have seen the new Parliament House in recent times would agree that it is starting to look a magnificent building. I am sure that is going to be the case when we see it completed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be one of the few things on which I would not accuse him of inconsistency. I personally think the building will look magnificent. Although many times in the past we have queried the cost and size of the project, I say to the Minister that we on the Opposition side are pleased that the project is on schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several matters of concern in the statement. As I said, the financial aspect in relation to the budgetary side of the project is almost six months out of date. It relates only to the period ending August. The other thing I note is that once again there has been a further blowout in the budget. The total project cost in the three months to August 1987 increased by a further $20.9m to an estimated figure of $1,047.8m. The increase of a further $20.9m in that three-month period is made up of $7.91m due to the inflation factor, $4.05m due to continuing industrial disputes, $1.74m due to insolvency of contractors, and $7.2m due to the reinstatement of previously deleted works such as landscaping. When the last progress report was made to this chamber on 9 October 1987 the Minister talked very loudly about the Government not being prepared to put up with any further industrial disputation and about the fact that the opening would go ahead regardless and that contractors and unions should note the Government's firmness of intent in relation to completing the building. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication was that the Government would be tough and, as a result, industrial disputation would not be a problem to the same degree that it had been. That statement was made in October 1987. It related to the report of budgetary figures to the end of May. We now have figures for the three months to the end of August, which is still earlier than the time at which the last report was given. In that three-month period to August 1987 there was an additional cost to the taxpayer of $4.05m due to industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous report, the October 1987 report, which dealt in budgetary terms with the nine months to the end of May 1987, showed the cost of industrial disputes for those nine months to be $9.9m. So we are comparing $9.9m for a nine-month period with $4.05m for the ensuing three-month period. In other words there has been a cost blow-out due to industrial disputes of $13.14m in the year to the end of August 1987. The equally serious-if not more serious-concern is that those figures reveal an escalation in the cost of industrial disputes in the latest three-month period for which figures are available. Indeed, they reveal an increase in industrial disputation costs from an average monthly figure of $1.1m to an average monthly figure of $1.35m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must very quickly give figures to this Parliament for the period since the end of August 1987 as to what has happened in that period because that has been the period about which the Government and everyone else has been most concerned regarding the likely possible outbreak of industrial disputation as we come closer to the completion date of the building. The figures that we have available to us today are figures of concern. I seek an explanation from the Government as to the reason for them and as to what has happened since August 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the Senate's attention the excellent report which has been released by a committee chaired by my colleague Senator Parer on rorts in the building industry. That report brought to light many rorts that were occurring, particularly those associated with the construction of the new Parliament House. There were an enormous variety of them which added up to an enormous cost to the taxpayer. For example, employees were known to stay away for two days simply because of a missing handrail. Employees went on strike because there was no water in the urn for morning tea and they had to walk 50 yards to get the water, and so on. That report brought matters of great concern to our attention. Again, there is no mention in this latest progress report by the Minister of what has happened in that area. I think that is a major omission from the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also mentions, without any explanation, an escalation of other costs which it states are outside the control of the Parliament House Construction Authority. For example, they include almost $1.75m over a three-month period for the insolvency of contractors. The preceding nine-month period to the end of May 1987 showed a figure of $4.6m for the same item of insolvency of contractors. So, there has been an increase in the monthly average cost to the taxpayer of the insolvency of contractors. The three-month figure is $1.74m, compared with a figure which, on a monthly basis probably would have been somewhat less, but not much less, over the ensuing nine-month period. Again, there is no explanation for those insolvencies. I think that the Parliament deserves a better explanation than the bland statement that we have had. </PARA>
<PARA> They are some of the matters that concern me about the report. I welcome the fact that the Parliament has been brought more up to date than we were before the receipt of this report, but it is a very superficial report. There is such a short period before the official opening of the building and its occupancy by us in August. I ask the Government and the responsible Minister-the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West-through Senator Robert Ray who represents him here, to ensure that the Parliament and, through the Parliament, the public, are much better informed very shortly, as to the real situation concerning the progress of the Parliament House building than is reflected by this superficial and very skinny statement that we have received today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concerns about this statement regarding the new Parliament House, as does my friend and colleague Senator Short. Senator Short said that this report relates to a period that ended last August. I suppose that we should congratulate the Government on coming out with a statement so quickly, as so far it has been unable to present the report of the Parliament House Construction Authority for the year ended 30 June last year. At least this statement only relates to August last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose a lowered degree of incompetence is expressed regarding the date of this one page report. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) to do whatever is appropriate to encourage the Parliament House Construction Authority to release the report for the year to 30 June, particularly in view of the disputation which has existed between the Auditor-General and the Authority. Surely this would impose upon that Authority a particular discipline to explain to this Parliament and to the people what on earth is going on in a $1 billion project involving taxpayers' money, which has been exposed in many areas as a mixture of incompetence and rip-offs. Of course, this is apart from having being revealed by a very detailed Auditor-General's inquiry as having many unsatisfactory elements involved in its cost control and other accounting areas. Frankly, it is scandalous that after so many months the annual report of the Construction Authority has not been presented.</PARA>
<PARA> I remember last year I got what I understood to be some kind of assurance, during a Senate Estimates committee hearing, that the report would be presented when Parliament resumed. Parliament has resumed. We are approaching the end of the first week. We still have not seen the annual report of the Construction Authority. The same thing happened last year when the report to 30 June 1986 was not presented to this Parliament until March 1987. Frankly, I think that this Parliament, and certainly this Government, ought to take severe measures against those instrumentalities, those authorities, which fail to meet the minimum reporting standards that are required under penal sanction by the law and, of course, by the stock exchange authorities when they relate to public companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A dramatic fall of status in the market, as evidenced in Adelaide so very recently. As I said, here we have a quarterly progress report to August of enormous detail, one page, while we have not got the annual report which is, of course, a matter of far greater substance and which no doubt will be adorned by a report from the Auditor-General, which all of us on this side of the House in particular, are eager to see. After all, we do have some sense of responsibility about the spending of taxpayers' money. If the Government does not share that sense of responsibility, I presume that is the reason it has done so little to ensure that this Parliament has received the annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the substance of this one page progress report. There is very little to enthuse about. Senator Short quite rightly pointed out the cost of industrial disputation and how it appears to have accelerated on a quarterly basis from the time of the last report. But I am concerned about the inflation rate. This report refers to the updating by $20.9m, in other words the further blow-out of $20.9m in the cost of Parliament House-and that is, of course, in August 1987 dollars, so it will be more than that now. What is quite interesting in that is the inflation factor, because the inflation rate in that period, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), according to the Australian Statistician, was 1.7 per cent. If 1.7 per cent equals $7.9m, that means about $460m is still to be spent on that project as of August last year. That is, of course, ludicrous. I do not know what remained to be spent at the end of August last year, the period to which this preliminary report relates, because it is not in this report. We do not know how much was outstanding, so we do not know what incredible inflation rate clearly applies to costs. But it is obviously far greater than the inflation rate of 1.7 per cent in that quarter according to the CPI figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to ask in the circumstances whether the Government could kindly provide us with what was the cost escalation rate which resulted in $7.9m in increased costs due to `inflation'. What was the index that brought about this kind of adjustment? Was it in fact due to specific circumstances which are not shared by the rest of the community? In other words, is there a special inflation rate that applies to Parliament House construction that does not apply to the rest of Australia? Of course the answer is yes, there is. The increase in costs, on the Construction Authority's own figures, that has taken place due to cost escalation and inflation seems to me far greater-something like twice as much according to my rough calculations-than the rate of inflation that has existed throughout the rest of Australia. It may well be that the building industry is subject to far greater inflationary pressures than other industries. All I can say is that I believe the Government, being the client in this case, had a special responsibility to ensure that, as it was such a significant client in such a significant building having such an enormous impact on building activity in this area, the inflationary costs in the building industry were not exacerbated by this project. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to inquire about the content of this $20.9m blow-out on top of the inflationary element, which I have already said seems extraordinarily large. The other elements are listed in this one page quarterly report as a series of costs outside the control of the Parliament House Construction Authority involving industrial disputes of $4.05m, insolvencies of contractors, $1.74m, and reinstatement of previously deferred or deleted works such as landscaping, $7.2m. That is a total of $12.99m. That makes up the total of $20.9m revealed as a blow-out in this quarterly statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we have more blow-outs to come, because this statement to the end of August quaintly excludes the clear and presumably substantial cost involved in creating three new ministerial suites in that building to account for the increase in the size of the Hawke Ministry, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had to placate various sections of various factions after the election in July. By the way, how much that would be I am afraid is a matter which I do not feel at liberty to discuss because I was recently appointed to the committee of this Parliament that deals with those matters. As I understand it, even though I am privy to the amount involved, it would not be right for me to reveal that without the approval of that committee. All I can say is that it seems to me that it would be decent of this Government to admit what the cost of three new ministerial suites in the new Parliament House would be. How many millions of dollars will be involved? I think it would also be decent for this Government to explain why, by the end of August, this additional cost was not revealed in this statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short says, Senator Cook can claim the credit for this expenditure. He was one of those who did the deal with the Prime Minister, no doubt recognising that, given what one could almost call a respectable delay, he would then be directly on the receiving end of the benefits. He did that sordid deal with the Prime Minister shortly after the last election. I wonder whether he declared his interest when doing the deal with the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that this kind of additional expenditure imposed on the Parliament House Construction Authority by this Government, as a result of actions taken in July and August, is not revealed in this quarterly report. In the next quarterly report, if the Government has got around to it and when we eventually get it, presumably we will see what the cost of these further additions has been. Let us recognise that during the construction of the new Parliament House there have been many instances, some enormous and some minor, of additional costs being imposed on the Construction Authority because this Government has changed its mind. It decided after the building was under way to increase the size of the Parliament. That cost upwards of $50m. Who knows? The real cost seems to me not to equate to the figures we have been officially handed out. I believe that it was more than the $41m listed in the statement we received, I think, last October or November. If one considers the changes of mind and the consequences of deals, like the three new ministerial suites, one sees this Government continually making alterations which are costly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the question of the Speaker's chair. A decision was taken almost two years ago to take that significant and historically important Speaker's chair from the House of Representatives into the new House of Representatives chamber. That decision, having been taken, was then reversed late last year. That decision involves the waste of $50,000, because that will be the cost of designing and installing a new, incredibly boring--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone says, it is totally dull, which befits the style of this Government in the other House. It has certainly lost any gloss it may have had. That incredible waste of money has taken place because of yet another change of mind by this Government relating to the new Parliament House. It is easy-let us face it, I have done it-to blame the Parliament House Construction Authority for everything but it simply must be recognised that, while the Parliament House Construction Authority has quite rightly been directly subject to a great deal of criticism, particularly for its lack of cost control and its inability to report in anything like a reasonable amount of time, this Government stands to be blamed for many of the cost rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me deal with another cost rise which I find difficult to identify within the headings that are in this quarterly report. Last year I asked Senator Button whether the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations had noted reports that the pace-setting severance pay agreement, now ratified by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, for approximately 1,000 building workers on the new Parliament House would add a further $1m to the cost of the project. As I asked this question in December, I do not expect its consequences to be reported to this Parliament probably until December of next year, judging by the rate of progress we have had so far and the delays that have been involved in getting information to this chamber. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Did the Government make any submissions to the Arbitration Commission on this matter before the determination was handed down? If so, was it in support of or in opposition to the proposal, particularly in view of the fact that previous opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>had led to a 12-week strike over this issue, costing multi-millions of dollars? Does the determination `conform to the Government's social security, taxation and wage fixing principles' which were stated by the Minister here on 7 October as a requirement for favourable consideration as a severance pay scheme and which at that time he said required substantial amendment if it was to either meet its intended objectives or satisfy Government wages policy or conciliation and arbitration principles? I ask the Minister: What substantial changes have taken place since 7 October to make this scheme acceptable, if it is now acceptable, and what will the costs and other consequences be of this decision being spread through the building industry?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) provided me with a reply which I received on 11 January this year, stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that Commissioner Baird on 15 December 1987 ratified a consent agreement providing redundancy pay for certain employees on the Parliament House project. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision is site specific and is an extension of a matter previously before the Commission. Major union and employers put submissions before the Commission. Whilst Commissioner Baird has not yet published his reasons he has indicated that the agreement is consistent with the Commission's termination change and redundancy (TCR) guidelines. Having been decided we must assume the decision is consistent with the Commission's wage fixing principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not intervene in this matter. As the Commission has determined that the agreement complies with the TCR principles, the Government accepts that the agreement is a genuine redundancy scheme and previous concerns expressed to the parties would not apply to this scheme. Accordingly, I would not expect there to be any problems in regard to the requirements of social security or taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that even though Commissioner Baird had not published his reasons the Government was quite happy to withdraw the objections it had held previously to a redundancy scheme which had caused a strike some time before because the Government at that stage was sticking to its so-called principles. Clearly, a couple of questions emerge from that. Has Commissioner Baird yet published his reasons and has the Government considered them, or is the Government determined not to consider them so that it will not have to undergo the intellectual rigour of finding out whether this agreement will add who knows how much to the cost of the new Parliament House in the face of the Government's so-called strongly held principles about redundancy pay?</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make only a couple more points about this matter. They relate to the response by people involved in the project to the quite proper concerns raised by the Waste Watch Committee when I chaired it. Most of the very sound points of criticism that were raised by the Waste Watch Committee have been endorsed by the Auditor-General's report. The complaints about the lack of cost control have been underlined by the Auditor-General. </PARA>

He was certainly upset about the matter and raised it in his report. I find the response of people involved at a very high level in the project to that criticism, which has been endorsed and which has never effectively been countered-there was an attempt to counter it by having a schedule at the back of a document provided for us which was totally inadequate in endeavouring to demolish the burden of criticism by the Waste Watch Committee-to be ludicrous. For example, there was the response in the Courier-Mail earlier this year by Mr Chandler, the project manager, I think, of Concrete-Holland, to attacks by the Waste Watch Committee and by me on the project. Mr Chandler was prompted to indulge in crude and offensive personal criticism of me and fellow senators and anyone who dared to criticise the waste of money-in my estimate about $200m-that has taken place because of practices that have occurred on the new Parliament House site. For example, Mr Chandler's response was reported as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ``It is all right for the likes of Senators Baume and Parer to be grizzling about it, but I notice they fly first class all the time and may fly to their places of origin several times a week in some cases,'' he said. </PARA>

<PARA> His main complaint is that much of the criticism is based on inaccurate information and seeks only to score political points. </PARA>
<PARA>For Mr Chandler's benefit, what we are seeking to do is to stop the incredible waste which has cost $200m because of the inactivity of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who has done sweet nothing to bring under control this waste of money, despite the fact that his Department is supposed to take an overall view of the accounting practices of government authorities. His incompetence in this matter is underlined by the $200m of public money wasted on this project. The Minister is as competent in the matter of the Parliament House Construction Authority and its lack of cost control as he was in understanding how the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was robbed of $12m because he and his Department would not allow the ABC to take out forward exchange cover. He did not understand how the forward exchange contract system worked. He tried to smart alec his way through at Question Time, revealing further his monumental incompetence--</PARA>

Serious matters are also involved in the way that this Government has continued to add to the ballooning cost of this project. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply saying to the Minister that it would be in his best interests, apart from in the best interests of the Parliament and the people of Australia, if he would use what could be described as his good offices-if he has any-to ensure that the annual report of the Parliament House Construction Authority for the year to 30 June 1987 is produced to the Parliament as quickly as possible and that an explanation is given to the Parliament as to why it has not yet appeared. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to inform the Senate that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has a number of concerns relating to the construction of the new and permanent Parliament House, particularly issues raised in and associated with the Auditor- General's report. I remind the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that, despite its depleted resources, the Public Accounts Committee will be proceeding with an inquiry, despite protestations from certain quarters, and is currently in the process of collecting information. The Minister's interjections support the feeling within the community about the Government's sensitivity to any independent evaluation of the management of its administration and its programs. It is not surprising that the staffing resource issue, which was raised in September last year, remains unresolved and that the Government, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker have remained unmoved to date, despite the fact that we are told that negotiations are continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems quite incongruous that the Government's chequebook is unlimited when it relates to extravagances for its Ministry, yet the resources of the Parliament are being checked and limited. Independent scrutiny of the Government by any agency or by the Parliament is being hampered by the Minister. The whole question of the sovereignty of Parliament arises. It is at risk. Democracy is at risk in Australia. While the Queensland Parliament moves towards the establishment of a public accounts committee, this Government of the Australian Labor Party, which is so proud about freedom of information and about independent checks, is now systematically and deliberately doing everything in its power to curtail any independent inquiry. It has done so not only in relation to the Public Accounts Committee but also in relation to the Ombudsman, freedom of information and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. It is replacing them with advisory boards-with people prepared just to give advice to Ministers. The Government does not want any independent assessment because it is running scared about what is actually happening. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister is so keen to invite me to debate him, I ask him-this follows his interjection in Senator Baume's speech-to tell the Senate what the Auditor-General did tell him when he announced his retirement from that office. Perhaps he may also like to tell the Senate what the Auditor-General said to him, by reports and directly, about the resources available to the Public Accounts Committee and the effect of their reduction. Perhaps the Minister will be brave enough to give the Senate those two answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the matter raised by Senator Watson about the duty and responsibility of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to deal with the Auditor-General's report as it deals with the Parliament House Construction Authority. As Senator Watson has pointed out, the ability of the Public Accounts Committee to deal with the efficiency audit has been held up because of the cutting back of resources to that Committee. It may be a flippant matter to raise, but one of the things that concern me, having made an inspection of the new Parliament House, is the relative sum that is being expended on parts of the building which it will be most interesting to look at when the matter is scrutinised. The item that springs readily to mind is the amount of money being spent on the rather opulent swimming pool-a swimming pool which is waveless, which has next to it a jacuzzi, and which has an opulence which I dare say would have satisfied Caligula and, indeed, Caligula's horse.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. Senator MacGibbon has brought up an important point relevant to the mismanagement of the project. Evidence is coming out to show that the Parliament House Construction Authority has much to answer for. Of great interest to me will be a comparison of the figures, when we are able to see them, to see whether the amount of money that has been spent on that opulent swimming pool is greater than that which has been spent on the chambers where the business of the Parliament is conducted. I can say only that, when I walked into the chambers in the new building, I was seized with a feeling that I can describe only as profound disappointment. The public spaces are magnificent as, indeed, the swimming pool is magnificent but my feeling of disappointment related to the complete breach and lack of following of any tradition in the colours in which the chambers have now been decorated. I used the word `decorated' advisedly because I feel that the colours that have been used and the way in which they have been treated with fabric and wood is a question of decoration rather than a question of traditional furnishing of a chamber where tradition is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I walked into this muddy brown-grey chamber, as distinct from the rich red chamber we have here, I looked at the seats or benches on which we will be seated, which reminded me of the front bench of a Holden vehicle, circa 1959, and with about as much comfort, and I looked at the narrowness of the desks at which we will have to sit that will take only an A4 folder and not a foolscap folder. I entered into a discussion with one of the people responsible for the design of the chamber and we almost got into an argument in which he asserted that his taste was better than my taste. I could not help concluding that in terms of the purposes for which the Parliament House was built, that is the conducting of the business of the nation in the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, that Parliament House is about as successful as the Sydney Opera House is for the production of opera. They are both magnificent buildings, both are very grand, and both will be historic and important buildings, but it is the attention to the parts of tradition in that building that disappoints me most. That is why I want to support the remarks of Senator Watson. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Public Accounts Committee comes to examine how well that building has been built, I think there is much to be disclosed. It is a pity that the cutting back of resources has postponed this inquiry. Senator Watson said `delayed', which is perhaps suiting some people's agendas so we do not have the answers to the questions that I think are relevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly about the new Parliament House statement. I wonder whether it really is a ministerial statement and how much of the statement can be trusted because past information given both to this Parliament and by the Minister has been found to be false by the Auditor-General and subsequently in questions raised in the Estimates Committee. The latest ministerial statement states-I think this was pointed out by Senator Michael Baume-that the figure goes only to August last year. I am unsure, as I am sure the Minister is unsure, because of the looseness of the statement, as to what the final cost will really be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One should have thought that at this stage an almost final completion date would have been known and provision could have been made for the contingencies or cost escalation by way of inflation or whatever so that the final figure would be known. Will it be the figure of $1,047.8m, or will it be something like $1.2 billion or $1.4 billion? I do not know, and no indication is given in this. One reason given for the escalations over the three months period from September to August 1987 is inflation of $7.91m. No breakdown of where that is has been provided. Industrial disputation seems to be extraordinarily high, although it is worth reminding the House that on 28 October last year I asked this question during an Estimates Committee inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it possible to obtain the number of working days lost through industrial disputation from September 1985 to the present?</PARA>
<PARA>The extraordinary thing is that in the past I have said that the things that went on in Parliament House were not too different from the rest of Australia, but suddenly we find that there are some differences. The answer I got to that question was:</PARA>
<PARA> The site has not been closed down since the 14 week dispute in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>So they kicked off with the good news! It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Records are not kept in a manner that would provide a direct answer to this question. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a good bureaucratic reply. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> However, in order to assess the costs to the project of industrial disputes, after 1984 a formula was agreed between the Authority, the Departments of Finance and Administrative Services (then Housing and Construction). Part of that formula provides an assessment of ``project days'' lost through disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>Having told us all that waffle, the Department then came to the point and said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the period September 1985 to September 1987-two years-</PARA>
<PARA>the assessed project days lost was 133.5, or an average of 5.6 days per month.</PARA>
<PARA>One week in every month was lost over the two-year period from 1985 to 1987, during the construction of the new Parliament House. By way of explanation, it was pointed out that the figures included time lost for stoppages for industrial health and safety issues. At the same Estimates Committee hearing it was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it possible to provide the updated Budget estimates in common base year as well as current costs and to disclose the inflation index?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee agreed that the response to this question would be dealt with in the Authority's annual report. This is currently being prepared-</PARA>
<PARA>this is on 28 October 1987-</PARA>
<PARA>and will be tabled in the Parliament as soon as it is available. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now well into February 1988. Another reason for increased costs given in the ministerial statement is the insolvency of contractors which had cost $1.74m. No explanation is given but it is possible that some of these insolvencies might represent, although I am not sure to what extent, a flow-on from some of the industrial disputation that occurred on site. The statement also referred to the reinstatement of deleted work such as landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA> I issued a report on the restrictive work practices as they applied to the construction industry, and part of that report-I believe some six pages out of about 32 pages-referred to the new Parliament House. Some of those examples have been well canvassed so I will not go through them. However, the sorts of things that happened were as described by Senator Michael Baume. We were subject to all sorts of castigation by the people who are up to their necks in this. For instance, one of the examples concerns a deal that had been made on climbing time for crane drivers. Crane drivers were paid two hours overtime every day to climb into their cranes. In fact, the estimate of the crane drivers who reported this matter to us was that it took them in the order of 45 seconds to do that little exercise. Even worse, a deal was made that the crane drivers who were no longer to operate cranes, as they had been put onto fork lifts, were to retain the climbing allowance for the cranes. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would probably say if this occurs in the private sector that it is a monopoly business involving the trade union movement and that the unions can force the private contractors to pay. Of course, at the other end of it somebody picks up the tab-either a future leaseholder or the owner of the building. However, we are talking about the Parliament House. We are talking about taxpayers' money. This should have been given much more serious attention than it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting point made to me by the construction manager when trying to justify this was that a lot of the additional costs were not their fault. To some extent that is right. If we look at the figures given last year we see there was an amount of about $41m-it is probably double that-associated with the extensions to the new Parliament House as a result of the increase in the number of senators and members introduced into this Parliament by the Labor Government. Simply increasing the number of senators and members has increased the cost of the new Parliament House by $41m. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course today we heard that we have three new ministerial suites. According to Senator Michael Baume, the additional cost of those is not included in the figure provided in the ministerial statement. Hence my questions at the beginning of my comments in regard to this matter were: where is it going to end and when will it be substantially finished? None of us know the answers to those questions. I think that we and the people of Australia are entitled to know the answers. The other point is that if the militant unions behind the problems at the new Parliament House continue in the way they have in the past, and know that there is an opening date and a final completion date, it is inevitable, as sure as the sun gets up in the morning and goes down at night, that they will pull on disputes. They know that there are dates that are vital. If that happens, it is absolutely imperative that this Government stands up and says, `Enough is enough. This is taxpayers' money and you have wasted enough already. We are not going to continue to buy peace'. </PARA>

In 1981, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources made a recommendation about renegotiating the contracts relating to alumina exports from Gove; the outcome I am presenting today is consistent with the Committee's recommendation. Before going further, I should briefly explain the structure of the Gove joint venture. The principal partner is Swiss Aluminium Ltd-Alusuisse, which is one of the world's six major integrated aluminium producers. This Zurich-based company holds 70 per cent of the Gove project through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Swiss Aluminium Australia, or Austraswiss. The 30 per cent Australian side of the venture is held by Gove Aluminium Ltd (GAL) in which CSR Ltd holds the major share. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point in respect of the situation which developed over pricing was that, at the outset of the project, Alusuisse entered into long-term sales agreements to purchase alumina from Gove for 20 years, and to do so under specific pricing formulas. Those pricing arrangements have produced prices which the Government regarded as out of line with fair and reasonable world market prices, even though there were some good prices particularly in the initial years. Over the last decade, Governments sought on many occasions to persuade the companies to bring exports from Gove into line with market prices received for other exports from Australia. The management of Alusuisse at that time would not agree to renegotiation. They argued that approvals given by the Commonwealth when the project was being developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s placed a contractual obligation on the Commonwealth to give export approval at prices derived under the sales agreements until those agreements expire in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not here go into the rights and wrongs of decisions taken almost 20 years ago; nor do I want to debate the validity of the legal view of the contracts which the company has taken. I must say, however, that, taken together with developments in the international market, the legacy of those decisions for the subsequent Governments was a complex contractual situation and a protracted dispute over pricing. Successive Ministers, including Mr Anthony as Minister for Trade and Resources, raised the matter with the companies. While there was some movement on bauxite, Alusuisse would not shift on the main alumina agreement. In 1986, following unproductive meetings with Austraswiss and Alusuisse in Sydney and in Zurich, the then Minister for Trade, Mr Dawkins, commissioned Mr Spigelman, QC, to undertake an investigation of Gove pricing. That initiative was a turning point. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that bauxite/alumina production has been a very closed industry-less so now than in the past, but it is still probably the least transparent of the mineral markets. Details of pricing and sales are not publicly disclosed. Spigelman's extensive investigation was able to throw considerable light on the Gove transactions. It presented the Government with a comprehensive review of the legal position and outlined a number of options.</PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the report were provided to the companies; needless to say, they contested many of the report's findings. The settlement today will mean that the Spigelman report will remain confidential to the Government and to the parties. I can say, however, that Spigelman recommended that a further attempt be made to secure a change in the alumina sales agreement through negotiation. This is the course the Government took and, while it has not been without difficulties, it was the course which produced the result I present today. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, met in August last year with the Executive Vice President of Alusuisse, Mr Hermann Haerri. Further negotiations followed at the official level. The breakthrough came late last year when Mr Haerri indicated that Alusuisse was prepared to work towards an overall package which reflected the interests of both the Government and the companies and, for the first time, agreed that this could include a new pricing arrangement. After several months of detailed negotiations with my Department and with the Australian Taxation Office, I have finalised that package today with Mr Haerri. I would like to acknowledge here the contribution that Mr Hermann Haerri has made to the successful outcome reached today. I indicate that Mr Haerri and his colleagues are in the gallery. Mr Haerri's strong personal commitment played an important part in the achievement of the settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Alusuisse has put to me today an amendment to the 1969 alumina sales agreement between Alusuisse and Austraswiss. These new provisions will apply as from 1 January 1988 until the agreement expires in almost five years time-in August 1992. In an exchange of letters today, I have confirmed the Government's acceptance of the terms of the settlement. The formal amendment to the agreement will be put to the boards of both companies for ratification in March. A number of related taxation matters have been concluded concurrently with this settlement. These arrangements apply to the 70 per cent of Gove alumina exported by Austraswiss. The other partner, Gove Aluminium, initially exported its 30 per cent of the output to Alusuisse but, under the terms of the original contract, this has been reduced over recent years and will be phased out shortly. These revised provisions for alumina exports follow the agreement on satisfactory prices for bauxite exports from Gove which the then Minister for Trade, Mr Dawkins, settled in 1986, and which have subsequently been renewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, these new arrangements represent a very good outcome for Australia. From my discussions with Mr Haerri today, it is clear that the company also regards the settlement as beneficial to its interests. The negotiations were conducted in a manner which reflected the wish of both the Government and the company to see this difficult issue settled by negotiation on mutually acceptable terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Gove is an important project for Australia, and particularly for the Northern Territory. It is a major investment for the Alusuisse group which relies on it for a high proportion of its alumina supplies. It is an efficient project by world standards and has a long term future. The agreement we have reached today will, I hope, enables us to look to that future in a way which will maximise the contribution that Gove and Alusuisse can make to the future growth and development of Australia. With the dispute now settled, I hope it will be possible for Alusuisse to resume an active role in that development, particularly as a base for meeting the growing opportunities in the aluminium industry in the Asian-Pacific region. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed, Senator. As the Minister said, this matter has a long history; indeed, it is one with which, in a previous capacity, I had some personal acquaintance and not, I hasten to add, of any detailed kind. Quite naturally and quite properly, the affairs of individual taxpayers in this country remain confidential to the Australian Taxation Office. As I say, I did have some personal acquaintance of what one might call a general policy character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister said, the matter has a long history. It was an issue which the coalition sought to redress-I think that was the word he used-when in government. That, of course, is perfectly true. Over the course of that long history I think it is fair to say that a certain amount of public approbrium has been brought to bear upon Alusuisse because, among other things, of various allegations made about what some saw as the unfairness, or in some cases worse, of the pricing arrangements involved in the exports of both bauxite and alumina from the Gove project. I think it is therefore fair to point out, as the Minister quite properly stated in his speech a moment ago, that at the outset of the project Alusuisse entered into long term sales agreements to purchase alumina from Gove for 20 years and to do so under specific pricing formulas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position on this aspect of the matter-in recent years at any rate-has been clearly stated by the Minister; namely, that those pricing arrangements, which were set out in what the company certainly saw as contractual arrangements, have produced prices which the Government regarded as being out of line with fair and reasonable world market prices-that may very well have been the case-even though there were some good prices, particularly in the initial years. As we all know from our own personal lives, it is perfectly possible to enter into contracts which, many years later, one finds will work against one's interests, but that does not necessarily mean, and ought not usually to mean, that the contract should in any way be regarded as invalid unless it has been entered into initially under duress or in some other way which in a sense, from a legal point of view, would in any case render the contract void. I do not believe that there has been any suggestion of that in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister acknowledged in his statement, there was a very different view of the nature of those contracts as to whether they were indeed unfair or unreasonable, or the prices resulting from them were unfair or unreasonable. That view was, not surprisingly, held by the company. I think it is fair, therefore, that that view also should be emphasised in this place when this matter is being recorded. I will quote the words of the Minister:</PARA>

<PARA>I pause on those words, `to give export approval', because I think that in recent times we have seen some very disturbing suggestions from Commonwealth Ministers for Resources that in some sense export approval might be withheld for exports of resource companies, particularly, but not merely resource companies, unless the company concerned is prepared to bow the knee to Canberra on some perhaps quite unrelated matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to be diverted from my remarks, but Senator Durack has queried whether Mr Dawkins is the sort of man who would utter threats. I would have to say, with the spirit of frankness and truthfulness to which naturally we are bound in this chamber and I hope, indeed, elsewhere, that Mr Dawkins is indeed the kind of man who would make such threats, and he has done so in this case, as Senator Parer said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To return to my more general point before the particularity was raised, I was about to say that this is a disturbing development from a constitutional viewpoint, because the export power which was accorded, quite properly-I am not questioning that-to the Commonwealth by the framers of the Constitution, I am quite sure, was not in any way intended to place in the hands of Commonwealth Ministers a bludgeon, which could then be held over the heads of companies or other citizens going about their proper and legally constituted business but over whose affairs the government of the day and the Minister of the day wish to obtain a hold. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, I think that has been a very disturbing development. We have seen further examples of that kind of approach to the matter coming forward in the case of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, who has invoked that kind of threat in the case of the north Queensland tropical rainforest controversy; but, again, I do not want to get into that. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the view of the company on the contractual arrangements concerned, the view of the company as stated by the Minister was that those arrangements placed a contractual obligation on the Commonwealth to give export approval at prices derived under the sales agreements until those agreements expire in 1992. Be all that as it may, the Government and the company have now, it seems, been able to settle their differences. Of course, the detailed nature of those differences remains obscure. We know the general nature of the differences, but the detailed nature of them remains obscure. There have been, it appears, extensive investigations of those details commissioned by the previous Minister for Trade and conducted by a Mr James Spigelman, QC, who I believe I recall having met in a previous incumbency, as the then private secretary to the then Prime Minister, Mr Edward Gough Whitlam. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were differences of opinion upon that view, but I do not wish in any way to detract from what is, I am sure, Mr Spigelman's growing reputation in the legal profession and fraternity in Sydney. I simply refer to the point that he was known to me and, I am sure, to many others in this place in his previous incumbency. I am glad to see the Government not forgetting some of its old mates in these areas as in others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that, as the Minister has pointed out, the settlement today will mean that what he calls the Spigelman report will remain confidential to the Government and to the parties; so, as a consequence of that the Senate will not have available to it the details of the differences between the Government and the company and will, therefore, not be able to arrive at an independent and fully informed judgment as to the pros and cons of those differences and, therefore, as to the fairness or, as the case may be, unfairness of the settlement that appears to have been arrived at. One problem that such confidentiality produces is that it is not really possible to determine now whether this agreement has been arrived at in a genuine spirit of co-operation or whether one of the parties to it has had its arm rather strongly twisted up behind its back. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, in fact, I had proposed to refer to the utterances of the previous Minister for Trade, Mr John Dawkins, in this area-and it has already been referred to in interjection, quite proper interjection, by Senator Parer and Senator Durack. The fact is that Mr Dawkins did at that time utter some remarks which I think can be described only as clearly strongly intimidatory remarks bearing upon the company's prospective capacity to continue to receive approval for export contracts. I would have to say that, although I would wish to be assured to the contrary-and I think the Minister's statement seeks to give an assurance to the contrary-against that kind of background, a negotiation of this kind must at least commence under something of a cloud. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is not the only kind of possible concern that might arise where one does not have available to one the full details of the matters under dispute or under negotiation because, to take the other possibility, one does not know whether perhaps the Government has entered into some other related understanding with the company; for example, purely to speculate-I do not in any way suggest this is the case; it is purely to speculate-in relation perhaps to the granting of further leases or perhaps even entirely new leases on some other entirely unrelated area for future mining operations. I do not suggest that either of these two hypothetical situations to which I have referred has occurred. I merely note that such speculations are inevitable when confidentiality, for however good reasons-and I accept that there are, naturally, some good reasons-is imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gove project is, of course, of great importance not only to Australians generally and not only to the residents of the Northern Territory, as I have already said, but most particularly, I would suggest, to those Australians, particularly those of Aboriginal descent, who reside in the close vicinity of the town of Nhulunbuy. That town is totally dependent on this project, as is the nearby Yirrkala community, which receives substantial royalty income from the mining operation and, I suppose, possibly-at least in my opinion-almost more important, substantial job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to end on perhaps a note of greater particularity, I just refer to one particular matter which, because of events over recent days, I think has acquired some topicality. My understanding is that the company in question has among its employees some 40 or 50 senior management or senior technical personnel and that there is a good deal of concern, among those people themselves in the first instance, but also, of course, on the part of the company at chief executive level and so on, as to the possible consequences for the company over the months immediately ahead as a direct result of the mooted changes in the taxation treatment of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The company is not singular in that respect. I am sure that honourable senators opposite just as honourable senators on this side of the House are receiving a great many communications, both written and telephonic, from extremely concerned citizens in this country who are wondering what this Government has in mind in that area. Of course, this is a matter which has been given even greater prominence in recent days by the initiative, if I can call it that, of Mr Unsworth, the Premier of New South Wales, in asking the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to make a clear declaratory statement on the topic, which he has so far refused to do. I put that on the table before concluding my remarks. Clearly, for an operation of this kind in any extremely isolated locality, which depends for its continued good health upon the retention of key executive personnel, it would be nothing short of a disaster if any, but particularly a sizeable number, of the people concerned were to feel that, so to speak, it was a case of safety first on this matter. I certainly trust that the Government will take the opportunity which the Opposition has been seeking to give it at Question Time in this place and elsewhere in recent days to say more clearly than it has so far been prepared to what it has in mind in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mining industry in Australia relies entirely on confidence. The report which the new Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, has brought down today deals specifically with one of the most important expressions of mining confidence in Australia in recent years. Just on 20 years ago Alusuisse took a giant step in confidence in looking at the bauxite deposits at Gove in northern Australia and subsequently developed the town of Nhulunbuy. It injected at that time, in mid-1960s prices, capital of about $400m in what was a very remote and isolated part of Australia. That great step in confidence between Alusuisse and its Australian partners provided the catalyst, I believe, for many of the other great mining projects that then happened throughout the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland. We rely very heavily on special arrangements that must be made from time to time between government and principal mining contractors. The fact that we have now reached the stage of negotiations where Alusuisse has been able to reach a new accord with the Government is timely. The history has just been outlined by Senator Cook and Senator Stone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to dwell for a few moments on the very particular things that do flow from confidence, particularly when one creates an absolutely new community. A town of some 4,000 people now exists at Nhulunbuy. This community comprises traditional Aboriginals, the mine related staff, their families and the various contractors and public servants and the private sector support in health, education, municipal functions or commercial activities that have sprung up in that 20-year period. All of this has happened because of the confidence in this project. What we must now guarantee is that that community, the Northern Territory community and the Australian community, can rely on the Government's intentions for the future and that the policies and actions that it has in place and is planning for the future will support the Nhulunbuy community, the Yirrkala community, the Northern Territory and other areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic importance of the Gove project to the Northern Territory is very easy to state. The value of the bauxite and alumina production for 1987 was somewhere between $300m and $350m, and that is in today's dollar terms. This represents 25 per cent of the total Northern Territory mineral production, which is estimated at some $1.2 billion. Mining is a most important industry in the very narrow-based economy of the Northern Territory. As I said, mining provides some $1.2 billion; the next important industry is tourism with $250m; and the pastoral industry follows that with $120m. So the mining industry carries the Northern Territory. It is the only catalyst for the long term and sustained economic development of the Northern Territory. Mining represents the only way in which the Northern Territory can cut its tie and dependency and stand on its own two feet. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, other important partners in mining in the Northern Territory-the various uranium projects, the manganese on Groote Eylandt and the gold developments that are happening. It is terribly important that we link this economic development to the strategic and defence importance of alumina as a product and what it contributes and to the fact that there now exists this important township in the north-eastern corner of the Northern Territory. As the future takes the Northern Territory fully forward into statehood, Nhulunbuy is going to play an increasing, important strategic and defence role. Similarly, I would like to see tourism developed in that community because it would be an important addition to its economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have argued in this place about the importance of Aboriginal land rights. There are benefits, there are liabilities and there are constraints imposed by Aboriginal land rights legislation. The homeland communities of the Aboriginal people of Yirrkala and the out- stations that now depend so heavily on the Gove project for employment, for royalties and for all the other associated support that they have come to enjoy I believe would attract the attention of many people throughout Australia. The executives of Alusuisse, in the 20 years they have been visiting Gove, have grown to know and appreciate the Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land. I am sure they had many fine negotiating times with Roy Marika and the other leaders. They have probably been just as tough as any Minister of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Stone said, the way in which government policies can often undermine confidence is surprising. The current uncertainty with regard to the superannuation initiatives of the Hawke Government is providing a problem in a major resource project that needs to be highlighted. This vital industry of the Northern Territory, with $300m in production a year, could have major problems unless the degree of certainty for superannuation is determined, because any major project depends on key personnel and management people who must have the confidence to want to remain. While their superannuation entitlements are under threat and barrage and subject to open warfare from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) it undermines this very great project. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the report that has been brought down by the Minister. It is obviously the culmination of a long saga and history, debate and controversy, but at least we now know that there is certainty. Alusuisse has given us the confidence we can rely on; let us only hope we can rely on the ALP to honour its part of the bargain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly lest it be considered that the Gove partners, Alusuisse, were in some way in the past acting in some way which was not in the interests of Australia. I do that because of the criticisms I heard from irresponsible, irrational people about this matter. I do it with the knowledge of and some experience in things such as resource development and long term contracts. One must remember that back in the late 1960s and early 1970s the Gove project was breaking new ground; it was pioneer work. I am grateful to Senator Tambling for giving me the figure of $400m, in mid-1960s prices, because if we were to take inflation into account that figure, in today's terms, would be between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I think it is important to realise that in those days there was not as much money around. Finance was not as easy to get. In order to put finance packages together it was critically important to obtain a resource that could be developed and measured, to get some security of tenure over that resource and then enter into agreements with the relevant governments that one could take to a financial institution, put on the table and say, `This is an honourable document from an honourable country and it will be honoured for its duration'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is easy for people to be wise in retrospect, but that was done in good faith. I note, for instance, that in the early years particularly good prices were achieved. The assumption one would make from that-and I do not know the details-is that the price then being paid was higher than the world market price. Everyone was very happy with that. Subsequently, as we know, things changed. We had massive inflation and the oil crises of the 1970s. There was an antagonistic government that used resource diplomacy to force companies-mine was one-to go to buyers in an effort to break contracts. That is the coarse way of putting it, but it is the right way. Other language was used. I see that the same sort of language is used in this document. It is similar to saying, `Let's do something that will be in our mutual interests', or words to that effect. What happens is that one's arm is squeezed. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> From my discussions . . . it is clear that the company also regards the settlement as beneficial to its interests. </PARA>
<PARA>That is magnificent language-`beneficial to its interests'. It is like saying, `We are just going to charge you more but it will be tremendously beneficial to your interests'. The only thing I can assume is that there was a threat that, unless they agreed, went halfway or settled the negotiation, we would withdraw export licences. The Government is expert at doing this. Most members of the Government have been involved in the industrial relations field, and that is how they operate. They come along and say `We have a dispute'. A dispute, to me, means that there are two parties but it is started by one. I am sure that Alusuisse did not say to the Government `We are in dispute'. I am absolutely convinced of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would have said, `There is this criticism, there is this nasty thing called transfer pricing and you are not paying the world market price'. I am sure that Alusuisse said, `Well, you're quite right'. But back in those days it was not easy to get this operation off the ground. Anyone who has not been through this would have no idea of how difficult it was. In those days we had to have these agreements in place in order to develop. This was one of the great developments in Australia-one that gave impetus, as Senator Tambling said, to the large-scale commodity investments in the rest of Australia. It attracted people to Australia. After that, for example, we had the major coal developments in the Bowen Basin with which I was associated. Yet it is all made to look so easy. Then someone comes back-I have heard particularly the Australian Democrats do this-and criticises these people as if they are evil people who are doing something awful to Australia, when in fact they have provided the impetus for massive exports, for developments in areas that would never have been developed without them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not critical of the statement of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), but it must be put in perspective. Agreements were entered into in good faith 20 years ago. I note from the ministerial statement that the agreement would have expired in 1992. Having got to 1988, why did we not do the honourable thing and say, `Let's honour something that expires in four years time'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the contract as it was established goes to the question of agreed prices at that time. I have no problem with that because I believe that someone who is going to establish a project of that magnitude needs to know that he will get a certain return before he invests money in such a project. Had those prices over a period of years led to a situation where no profits were being made, or to very poor profits, and had world prices been such that the prices for the product from Gove were higher, one could understand that there would not have been a re-negotiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at the nature of the contract and where the benefits went, one sees a project that is selling a product to a company which owns 70 per cent of the project. If that is not a clear case of transfer pricing, which disadvantages the people of this country because certain taxes should have been paid on profits, but were not made available to be used to finance the social wage and to carry out all those necessary things in the community, I am afraid I have been reading the wrong information. I am afraid that there are millions of people in this country who are wrong also. I reject that proposition; we are right. I believe that the way in which the negotiations were held were proper. It is not exceptional, many years after the agreement to a contract, when all matters are considered, that this should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> A while ago someone mentioned pressures. I suggest that that is what the business world is all about-pressures that can be brought to bear by all sorts of skills and abilities in terms of finance and other managerial devices. I do not think it is wrong for the Government to exert some pressure. It exerts it on behalf of the people of this country, who would benefit from taxation. It would also benefit those Australian companies involved in 30 per cent of the venture that is Australian-owned. The company which may have been receiving the pressure would be receiving it on behalf of the shareholders, many of whom are very rich and who really do not need the money, except to increase their power in the world community.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I say first of all how disgraceful I believe it is that the Senate is confronted with 112 Government Papers to discuss and the time we are allotted for this item is one hour. I accept the point that those not dealt with will be carried over; but this is just another example of the absolute maladministration that the Government side of the Senate has fallen into in recent times. I never thought I would ever believe that I would say, `Bring back Don Grimes', but, given Senator Gareth Evans's performance since he took over this field, I would have to say that. </PARA>
<PARA> Paper No. 4 is entitled Simultaneous Dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives-5 June 1987, and it contains the correspondence between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Governor-General relating to the dissolution of both Houses of Parliament on 5 June 1987. The Prime Minister's letter to the Governor-General of 27 May 1987, which is the key trigger letter for this report, has as the whole basis for requesting the double dissolution election the Senate's rejection twice of the Australia Card Bill. The Prime Minister, in his letter advising the Governor-General that there ought to be a double dissolution of the Parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Card Bill 1986 is an integral part of the Government's tax reform package . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In another part of his letter to the Governor-General, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Card Bill which has been obstructed by the Senate is a fundamental part of the Government's legislative program both in terms of its economic impact and in terms of the principle of equity it represents. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to those words a little later. I want to put the proposition that the Prime Minister went to the Governor-General seeking a double dissolution on the basis of the Australia Card legislation, knowing first of all that the Senate, as then constituted, would not allow the regulations under the legislation which would be necessary for its ongoing operation and, secondly, that a double dissolution election would almost certainly ensure the continued existence in the Senate of the Australian Democrats. So the Prime Minister's advice to the Governor-General that a double dissolution election was necessary in order to bring in an operable ID card scheme was quite wrongly based from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is only part of the story because, as history has now recorded, the Government was unbelievably maladroit in its handling of the whole ID card issue. Its incompetence was of a magnitude that absolutely boggles the imagination even of those of us on this side of the House who are living day by day with ever increasing examples of ineptitude by the Government. That is really saying something because, as we all know now, so badly was the Australia Card Bill drafted, so incompetent was the Government, that it required the support of the Senate to trigger its operation, and the Government knew that the Senate would not give that trigger. So not only was the Government incompetent; it also appears in my view that the Prime Minister misled the Governor-General in his advice of 27 May 1987 to dissolve the Parliament because of the Australia Card Bill. At the very least it shows what a contrived, totally unnecessary and extremely costly exercise the Government's cynical, opportunistic calling of the 1987 election was. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the taxpayer of the 1987 election was of the order of $50m. The Government said earlier that the trigger for the double dissolution, the ID Card Bill, was, and I quote again, `an integral part of the Government's tax reform package'. It has now changed its tune on that one. It also said that the ID card was a fundamental part of the Government's legislative program both in terms of its economic impact and the principle of equity. On that basis then, on its own admission, its present legislative program is defective, which is something we have been telling the Government since the outset. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did speak for a very brief period on this paper last year and, as I stated then, this is the final operations report and financial statement of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA). This Institute ceased to exist as from 1 January 1987 and has since been replaced by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, known as OMA, which is situated in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As I said before, this report mentions the final detailed report of this particular Institute, known as Future Directions for Multiculturalism. I would like to read to honourable senators the first few words of the introduction of this report, which sets the scene for a multicultural society as we know it today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has one of the most diverse populations in the world. In 1986 Australians included people born in more than 80 other countries and speaking more than 100 languages in addition to the approximately 150 Aboriginal languages still in existence. At the same time Australia is a country remarkable for its internal peace and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>The final report of AIMA was produced from Canberra in 1987 under the name of the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Mick Young. I guess that it must have been one of the last reports in this portfolio put out by ex-Minister Young. Having attended ethnic functions with Mr Young I can certainly say that he threw himself into those sorts of activities with great verve. But it was disappointing to us all that the final piece of legislation in this portfolio should have contained two sections which have had very disturbing consequences. The first section is that in the Migration Amendment Act 1987 which relates to the $5 arrival fee. We have all read in the newspapers about the chaos at international airports because of this fee and the difficulties that international airlines have had, especially our own Qantas Airways Ltd, recovering this fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I would not care to use the same language Senator Walsh used in this chamber a short while ago, I would nonetheless like to point out that we have this $5 arrival fee with us because when the clause in the Bill was voted upon the Government voted with the coalition Opposition. The measure had nothing to do with the Australian Democrats. To coin Senator Walsh's phrase, the Government was in bed with the coalition Opposition. That is why we have had the obnoxious $5 arrival fee imposed upon us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Walsh keeps talking about him and the Clayton's road that is supposed to be up there. Naturally I am very interested in the annual report of the Department of Primary Industry. I realise the many difficulties that confront families on the land. Some of those difficulties are caused by drought, flood and other natural disasters. We had a natural disaster recently in Cooyar, Queensland. There was so much rain on the Bunya Mountains that a vast volume of water washed away a great part of the little township of Cooyar, resulting in deaths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As one who looks after the farm accounts at home I have long since realised that it is difficult to make much of a profit on the land. Quite often the reverse is the case and the land becomes a loss. After one takes into account the cost of seed, fertiliser, fuel, sprays for weeds and bugs and, in many cases, farm wages there is certainly not much left as profit, particularly with the low prices so many commodities command on the world markets these days. Then, if the dear Lord does not send the rain at the right time any profit there might be turns into a loss. We have a crop of soya beans in at home at present. We are very grateful that we have had three inches of rain recently which means that we might get a little crop instead of having to turn the beans over and put them back into the ground. It is certainly no wonder that so many people on farm properties have to sell up and go to live in the towns. I sometimes wonder who will be left to feed our city dwellers if this trend continues. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider this annual report the importance of primary industries to this country becomes very apparent. Primary industry provides over 40 per cent of our export income and accounts directly or indirectly for one in every four jobs. The Budget allocation to primary industries last year was $403m, down $56m on the Budget allocation the previous year. So an industry which continues to provide 40 per cent of our export income receives less than one half of one per cent of total Budget outlays. That $403m does not represent all the government assistance. Transfer payments of industry levies are also collected from farms. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government continues to disregard the importance of this industry sector. Its lack of emphasis on rural Australia clearly shows that it does not understand where the majority of wealth in Australia is created. What is said to be the cause of some of the problems in the rural industry? It could be high interest rates, the increasing cost of farm implements, falling product prices, the exchange rate, the world financial markets, poor economic policy or the subsidies paid to farmers in Europe and elsewhere which, we all realise, have caused many problems for the people on the land here. There is no doubt about it. I read in a newspaper recently that the European Economic Community is considering a plan to pay farmers not to grow their produce. These are some of the things that cause problems in our rural industry. The Government should do a little more to help people on the land and not put up fuel prices so that the people who live in the outback have to pay enormous prices. I was interested to read the report and have pleasure in speaking to it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1986-87 annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission was prepared after the 1987 election but deals with the period ending 30 June 1987. The material in the report and, more importantly, other material relating to the electoral process shows not only that the calling of the 1987 election was a pragmatic and cynical decision made by the Australian Labor Party (ALP), as I said in earlier comments on another paper, but also that the claim that the election was called because of the Senate's refusal to block the ID card Bill was absolute bunkum. We now know to what lengths the Australian Labor Party will go to secure a victory. We have seen that in particular in the last couple of weeks when the ALP diverted a donation of $10,000 from the woodchip company Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd, which was given for the ALP's election campaign fund, into its administration account in New South Wales so as to avoid the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act such as are discussed in the Australian Electoral Commission report and other Commission documents. As we all know now, the reason that disclosure provision was breached was to enable the ALP to keep secret from the environmentalists and conservationists that it had received money from a woodchip company at the same time as it received support from the major environmental groups. Some of the key conservation organisations, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Wilderness Society which had been the recipients of vast sums of money from the Hawke Government, came out openly and financially in support of the ALP at the last election. So, of course, a decision was made by the Labor Party apparatchiks to hide the Harris-Daishowa donation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the fundamental functions of the Electoral Commission is to ensure that election returns and statistics are valid and accurate. Indeed, it is fundamental to the democratic process that they be so. That being the case, I am extremely disturbed to have received today from the Electoral Commissioner, Dr Hughes, a copy of Staff Circular 1988/11, dated 16 February, only two days ago, which he has sent to all members of the staff of the Electoral Commission. I seek leave to have the circular incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Election Returns and Statistics</PARA>
<PARA> As many Commission officers already know, a number of substantial defects have been identified in the Returns and Statistics relating to the 1987 election. The problem began when answers were sought to questions put to the Commission by Senator Jim Short, the Shadow Minister for Home Affairs; when those answers were pursued, further difficulties were uncovered. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. It now appears possible that the existing Returns and Statistics cannot be relied upon with any certainty. It has been established that in the areas where inquiries have already taken place, far too many figures are defective and that in some instances failure to carry out procedures properly is responsible. What is not known is the degree of accuracy of figures in the many areas which have not yet been tested. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. In April, or at latest May, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is expected to start its inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 election. It is essential that the Commission be in a position to give full and frank evidence on the accuracy of Returns and Statistics and, where deficiencies have been identified, their likely causes and the remedial steps which are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Accordingly a working party is being set up to recheck and recount the ballot-papers and declarations from a sample of Divisions. The working party will operate in Canberra at premises close to Central Office. It is hoped work will start on 29 February and run for 5-6 weeks so that findings are available to the Joint Standing Committee at its hearings. The working party will include Mr Lionel Sampford, formerly Director of Operations, Queensland, and principal author of the Elections Manual, Mr Ian Johnston, Director of Industrial Elections, New South Wales, Mr Shawn O'Brien, Operations, Central Office, Mr Martin Johnson, DRO Eden-Monaro, and Mr Bob Patching, DRO Rankin. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The inquiries that have already been taking place concerning Returns and Statistics have led to accusations of ``witch-hunting'' being tossed about. Nothing is further from the truth. The Commission's performance is subject to close scrutiny by the parliamentary process and under FOI legislation. It is accountable to the Government and the Parliament and to the electorate for that performance. When its performance is less than satisfactory, everyone in the Commission is adversely affected. When electors are disfranchised by administrative errors, when parties or candidates are denied public funding payments to which they were entitled, or when records required to be kept so that election results may be challenged are lost, it is clear that better performance is necessary and it is in everyone's interest that this be achieved as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very full report of the activities for the year of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. There is a substantial overview at the start of the report which describes initially how the year 1986-87 was a year of substantial progress in implementing a gradually increasing immigration program with emphasis on skilled and business migration, family reunion and Australia's international humanitarian obligations in assisting a record number of temporary entrants and of refugees into our country. Of course, as everyone knows, the FitzGerald inquiry-not the Queensland one, but the one taking place here in Canberra-that is, the Committee to advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, is looking into our immigration policies and I am sure that, when that report comes out, everyone will be very interested in what it has to say. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said of late, and there has been a lot of public discussion both in the newspapers and here in the Senate, about the value of our adult migrant English program. There are some very interesting statistics on page 114 of this report, which may be of interest to the Senate, on those who participate in the adult migrant education program. They show that those who have been here up to six months comprise 28 per cent of the participants; those who have been here from between six months to two years comprise some 26 per cent of the participants; those who have been here from two years to 10 years comprise more than 28 per cent of participants; and those who have been here more than 10 years comprise over 14 per cent of participants. </PARA>
<PARA> What these figures reveal to us all is that, whatever our views may be on immigration and on who should or should not be allowed to migrate here, if the level of English of migrants once they arrive here is not sufficient for their requirements, they are entitled to adult migrant education programs. These programs must be ongoing because people have different needs at different stages of their lives. This is borne out in the report and it is what these figures reveal. It seemed to be very neat and tidy to state that people should have a certain level of English before the get here. But, as they progress within our society and as they perhaps improve their employment and move into areas of employment where a more sophisticated level of English is required, it is up to us under our equal opportunity legislation to be sure that these people have these programs available. These statistics reveal that that is what is happening. It would be very disadvantageous to Australian society as a whole if there were any break in these programs. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) on its annual report. The Commission has certainly done a lot of work over the past year in bringing tourists to Australia. Under the heading `Looking Ahead' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest in Australia as a tourist destination continues to grow at an unprecedented rate with record arrival figures from every major market indicating a strong willingness to travel. In short, overseas travellers are not just interested, they are coming. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very good indeed. I believe that the work that the Tourist Commission has been doing has helped in that regard. There is no doubt that tourism plays an important role in the economy of Australia. It will contribute $24,000m to the gross domestic product. It will also contribute almost $3,000m in foreign currency income to Australia. As a Queensland senator, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that Queensland has played a vital part in this because it is a focal point for the tourist industry as Australia's leading holiday State. Recent surveys put the direct value of tourism to the Queensland economy at $4.3 billion. When the multiplier effect is taken into account and the benefits flow through the economy, this converts to more than $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Actually, the highly esteemed Boeing report produced by the giant United States of America corporation Boeing Commercial Aeroplane Co. predicts that tourists will be spending $21 billion a year in Queensland by the year 2000. If tourists are spending that much money in Queensland and one multiplies that by the number of other Australian States, it represents a tremendous amount of money being spent on tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> This year is our bicentenary year and World Expo 88 is being held in Queensland. That will be wonderful for attracting tourists to Queensland, but they will not only stay in Queensland, they will go to other States. I asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) a question about flights into Queensland and Australia because many potential tourists are keen to visit this year and may not be able to do so because of insufficient airline flights to bring them to Australia. I should not like to think that World Expo 88 was being deprived of tourists because they could not get on an aeroplane. I asked the Minister whether he would support free skies to open up the number of airlines coming into Australia but I am afraid he did not give me a satisfactory reply. </PARA>
<PARA> World Expo 88 is the first world exposition to be held in the Southern Hemisphere in this century. More than 45 overseas states and nations, all Australian States and the Australian Capital Territory, and 32 corporations are expected to join the event being staged on the banks of the Brisbane River overlooking the city centre. If honourable members have not been there to see for themselves, I recommend that they go and have a look at the tremendous progress being made there. World Expo 88 starts on 30 April, which is soon, and the Queen will open it. Just as I have tried to sell Queensland and its tourism today while I have been speaking to the report, so has the Australian Tourist Commission been selling Australia to the world. It has certainly resulted in a tremendous increase in tourism generally. </PARA>

In addition, but more importantly, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has estimated that 25 per cent of all family farms were debt free in 1986-87, 50 per cent had debts of less than $82,500, and only 12 per cent had debts of $163,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important aspect of the new rural adjustment scheme is the provision of money in three parts. Part A is provided when carry-on finance is needed because the farmer's liquidity has suffered as a result of a downturn in the economy yet the farm is still a viable concern. Part B of the scheme provides assistance in short-term market downturns when farmers face a one-off problem caused by drought or fire. Part C of the scheme is for the farmers who cannot carry on and assistance is provided for their rehabilitation elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The most worrying aspect of the report was what it did not show rather than what it showed. For example, Western Australia was allocated approximately $3.1m in interest subsidy and half the interest subsidy is given to provide leverage to borrow from a commercial lender. That allowed for approximately $31m to be borrowed but only half of that was used in Western Australia, the other half was returned to Canberra. The reason for this was that the guidelines set down by the rural adjustment scheme-fair though they may be-are being interpreted too strictly by the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation (RAFCOR), which is the agency that operates in Western Australia. Some of the bureaucrats who have been appointed to it are not doing their jobs correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, one must borrow money from private enterprise and the person who wishes to borrow the money is carefully considered. Before a decision is made to lend the money, private enterprise must be sure of its security. Therefore, I cannot see the reason for RAFCOR having so many bureaucrats in Perth to examine the budgets that the private lender has already considered. The time of the bureaucrats would be much better spent in other ways. I suggest to the Federal Government that the guidelines be altered to allow the farmer to accept the money that a commercial lender has agreed to lend to him without any further hold-ups by RAFCOR. The other amendment Western Australia put to the Federal Government was to change the guidelines on viability. I understand the difference between being placed in a viable category and a category of need is only $9,000. That amount is also provided each year for up to three years through household support, if one cannot continue farming. Western Australia asked the Government to consider increasing the limit placed on the amount of the loan that places one in a viable category. The Government could consider giving the farmers $27,000 so that they could leave the farm immediately rather than giving the farmers three years on household support of $9,000 each year and waiting for them to sell their farms. If that were done the farmers' creditors would not be dragged down the line as well. I urge the Government to carefully consider that and to put forward a proposition next year because during the past few years this scheme has provided adequate carry-on finance for farmers all over Australia but it may be further improved because agriculture is on the move. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the motion, I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate a particular consultant who is set out in this report as having been appointed and still appointed to the staff of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). Last year by way of a question without notice I drew the attention of the Senate to the appointment of Mr Alan Asher to the Trade Practices Commission and to the fact that he is largely an anti-business appointee. I questioned his suitability for that appointment. This matter is relevant to the annual report because it is stated on page 4 of the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services on the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 that Mr Crough would be employed by the Attorney-General to:</PARA>
<PARA> Provide advice on consumer affairs and trade practices matters, and other issues as may arise. Research and drafting of speeches. </PARA>
<PARA>More particularly, it was his job to:</PARA>
<PARA> Represent the Attorney-General at, or attend with him as adviser, Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, he was to:</PARA>
<PARA> Liaise with National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council and advise generally concerning authorities and bodies in consumer affairs and trade practices areas. </PARA>
<PARA>It was the same Mr Crough who had a major say in the appointment of Mr Alan Asher. I think it is appropriate that we put on the record just who Mr Crough is because there is speculation in the marketplace at present that with the retirement of Mr McComas this Government may choose to appointment Mr Alan Asher as Chairman of that Commission. Quite frankly, in the eyes of the business community as a whole, that would be totally unacceptable. I think it is of interest to record the history of Mr Crough. He was the original deputy to Professor Ted Wheelwright at the Transnational Corporations Research Project, which was established in 1975. He is indeed a protege of Professor Wheelwright, who is well known as an economist with neo-Marxist tendencies. The attitude of the body I just mentioned is best illustrated by Ted Wheelwright's statement to the World Congress of Consumerists, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying is that modern capitalism is frightfully undemocratic, whether transnational or local. Let's get it clear, the capitalist system is the cause of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>In the late 1970s and early 1980s Mr Crough was a frequent contributor to the Communist Party of Australia newspaper, the Tribune. In 1981 Mr Crough went to the Soviet Union with Professor Wheelwright-bearing in mind that Professor Wheelwright was then in his sixties-as a delegate to an international seminar of youth researchers. Indeed, Mr Crough was a delegate at that time together with a representative from the Young Socialist League of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 Mr Crough was first appointed as a consultant to the Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen. As I understand, and in the terms of his appointment which I have cited, that position still exists. In 1987 Mr Crough was one of four people who were on the selection committee which appointed Mr Alan Asher to the Trade Practices Commission. The answer that I received in this place to my original question was that there had been extensive advertising and interviewing for this job. In fact, there had been two applicants after what I would describe as a rather limited advertising program. I think it is important to draw the attention of the Senate to this matter for the simple reason that very often we hear this Government talked about in fairly benign terms. I think it important that people be alerted to the hidden and second agenda. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report for 1986-87 of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) comes at a time when the Service is under review by the current Government. Consequently, the interest that people might have in the report really tends to focus on the issues that are being discussed by the Department of Transport and Communications in the preparation of a review to be presented to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Gareth Evans) rather more perhaps than on the issues that are set out in the report itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note first of all that there has been a change in the management of SBS in the last year. We find that the new head of SBS is to be Mr Brian Johns who, of course, is well known in Australian Labor Party circles. I understand he has worked for the Australian Labor Party in various fields. Consequently, his appointment comes as no great surprise, given the history of Labor in recent times. We know however that Mr Johns has a background in the literary field; he was the former head of Penguin Books. It is perhaps interesting to note that by leaving that organisation he created a vacancy that was immediately filled by the appointment of former Senator Susan Ryan. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just make the point. The Special Broadcasting Service is currently, as I said, up for review. There are a number of matters that require attention by government-and primarily there is, of course, the fundamental question of funding. We know that the SBS provides a service par excellence for those people who listen to radio and who can understand very little English. Consequently, the foreign language broadcasts are of great importance to them. We salute the SBS for its continuing attempts to ensure that it has the widest possible coverage throughout Australia for those people who require that kind of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards the television operations of SBS, we know that they are, of course, substantially hampered by a lack of funds. However, generally speaking, it does provide a very good service. It is interesting to note that many of its programs are watched by large numbers of people who of course have what might be described as non-ethnic backgrounds. Programs such as the international news and international soccer broadcasts have a very high reputation. Those sorts of programs no doubt are substantially adding value to the Australian community generally. They also run in harness with other television programs which might be described as highbrow subjects. We often hear opera and see ballet and other material of cultural value on SBS. We commend SBS for that. However, there does seem to be something of a diminishing emphasis on multicultural television on SBS and we wonder whether the Government in its review is considering winding down that aspect of the Special Broadcasting Service. No doubt that will emerge in the course of the review currently being undertaken by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I raise the vexed question of the merger of the SBS and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which was proposed by the Government about a year ago. That, of course, was knocked on the head by the combined efforts of the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I understand that that matter is still on the Government's agenda and no doubt will surface again in the course of the current review being undertaken by the Minister. We will watch that development with a great deal of interest. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) is, to say the very least, in crisis. There is absolutely no doubt that the Government has so mishandled the operations of the Tribunal-I will come to an example of that in a moment-as to have created a crisis of morale and conscience within the organisation to the point where one wonders whether the Tribunal is, in fact, carrying out its proper duties or, indeed, is able to carry out its proper duties. I instance the example of the Government's mishandling last September of the proposal, as announced in the Budget, to call for tenders for new radio licences from those people seeking to establish new radio stations. Of course this was done totally without consultation with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Obviously, it cut right across the operations of the Tribunal in such a way as to render its processes absolutely irrelevant. As I say, this was done without any consultation with the Tribunal. It has produced a crisis within the Tribunal. The Chairman has made public statements. The implication of those statements is that the Tribunal's processes and the very existence of the Tribunal need to be questioned. We know the Tribunal performs many valuable duties in examining the material which is broadcast on commercial television and radio. It makes sure that certain standards are maintained. We believe that those processes are worth keeping, but we do note that the processes are in great need of reform and streamlining. The time taken for the hearings of new licences, such as Perth's third licence, is, clearly, outrageous. It took something like 18 months to have the processes completed. Those issues have indicated that the Tribunal is in need of a great deal of change. We know that the Expenditure Review Committee is currently examining the Tribunal. We look forward to its report and to its suggestions as to what might be done to alter the direction of the Tribunal and how it might operate more effectively. Certainly, we have some suggestions which will be made known in proper time as we approach the next election and as we release our policies with regard to communications generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is time for a major review and rethink of the Tribunal and its operations and direction. It is too costly to operate. It is too costly to business and to the broadcasting industry generally in the way it ties up very expensive legal counsel for days, weeks and months on end for what appears to be very minute results. That is something which should touch the hearts of Ministers in the Government such as Senator Walsh who are very concerned about efficiency and where Government expenditure is going. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Tribunal report we are discussing today is full of information which we will be examining in detail in the next few months. We will use that as the basis for the preparation of our own policy. </PARA>

<PARA>I am very pleased to see the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds) in the chamber. I know she is a busy lady. I hope she takes note of some of the comments I will make. Page 14 of the report is interesting. I happened to be glancing through it and noticed that the Local Government Grants Commission in Western Australia made similar comments to those made by the Grants Commission in Tasmania. The Government has been saying-it may be true-that its level of funding to local government in real terms has not changed. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> For both years the inflation rate was higher than the increase of general purpose payments to the States. For 1987/88 the CPI increase for the year ended March 1988 was 8%, whereas the increase of general purpose payments to the States was 2.38%. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian entitlement as specified by the Act is-</PARA>
<PARA> 1986/87 9.3028% of total fund</PARA>
<PARA> 1987/88 9.2407% of total fund</PARA>
<PARA> 1988/89 9.1788% of total fund</PARA>
<PARA> The last year shows a reduction in the State's share. </PARA>
<PARA>That follows from some comments made by the Grants Commission in Tasmania that in real terms Tasmania has had a reduction of 5 per cent in general purpose grants from the Federal Government this year and is looking at another 5 per cent reduction next year. Western Australia will also receive reduced grants. This obviously leads us to believe that other States in Australia will receive more. I have difficulty in accepting this and what the Minister had to say in answer to questions on one or two occasions when she said that the new system of making grants available was on a more equitable basis. It seems that States such as Tasmania and Western Australia which are further away from the so-called centre of government are treated less favourably. </PARA>

<PARA> I ask the Senate to take these matters on board. Mr Hawke was in Hobart two or three weeks ago and addressed some representatives of local government. I, Senator Tate and a few other members of the Australian Labor Party were there. Mr Hawke made a great point about how sympathetic he and the Government were to local government. He commented that he had a special place in his heart for local government. I just wish the rest of Cabinet shared that view because it seems to me on these figures and the comments made by States Grants Commissions and the Cameron report that local government has been hoodwinked into believing that it is receiving increased funding when there are records and reports to show quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Labor member for Denison, Duncan Kerr, who called on the Government to come up with a more equitable grant payment structure. I disagree with what the Minister has been saying for some time now that this new system is a more equitable way of distributing funds to local government because two States are, quite obviously, receiving less. If that is not inequitable, I do not know what is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make a few remarks to indicate that I was disappointed with one aspect of this annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). I shall mention only that matter in my comments this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year when I was discussing the Corporation's annual report for 1985-86, I made specific reference to one section of the Board's report to the Minister. A copy of that report was reproduced at the beginning of the annual report. In this report the Board commented on its accountability and referred to the then Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. It implied that the Committee should not have pursued a particular inquiry because it was interfering with the independence of the ABC. The inquiry mentioned was into the adequacy of the ABC's radio racing service in Queensland. I noted last year that this chamber by that time had resolved that the Corporation had acted wrongly in frustrating the efforts of a committee established by a House of the Federal Parliament. Last year I concluded my remarks on this matter by saying that I expected that, in its next annual report, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation would report factually on what occurred after it refused to co-operate with the Senate Committee. I should have known better. The only reference in the ABC's 1986-87 annual report was on page 66, which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The year also saw the curtain lowered on two issues of dispute between Parliament and the ABC: the Queensland radio racing inquiry (before the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts) and the long-running Cotton matter (before the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs). </PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry that the ABC did not see fit to put in its report the way that this inquiry ended because, when the Senate had examined this matter, it resolved that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was correct in what it had done. It requested that Committee to reconsider, in the light of its own evidence and the answers subsequently given by the ABC to the Senate Estimates Committee, whether further investigation was required. The Committee decided to do this and the investigation was carried out. This should have been mentioned in the report. Apparently the ABC likes to dish it out, but when the ABC is found to be in error it is not willing to admit it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its concern about the breakdowns to essential services in New South Wales associated with the policies of the Unsworth Government, and calls on the New South Wales Labor Government to use Commonwealth grants to the State to the advantage and benefit of all the citizens of that State. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion relates to the sorry state in which the people of the State of New South Wales find themselves today. After 11 years of Labor Government, my State finds itself in a position of disarray and disorder. It finds its essential services worse than they were last year, worse than they were 10 years ago and worse than they were year by year. The State finds these services getting worse all the time. This is well known, and I shall now document just part of the disorder and disarray. Some of my colleagues from the State of New South Wales will add other areas and other detail to what is a sorry and continuing story of what has happened in the potentially great State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is about the breakdown of essential New South Wales Government services like law enforcement, health, transport, education, housing and planning. It is about wrong priorities, corrupt decisions within government, and about ineffective and inefficient management. It is about the inadequate delivery by both the Wran and Unsworth governments, by all the Labor governments over a decade, of the basic services which State governments are supposed to provide. Overall it is about a government that has favoured the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government has allowed its public services to deteriorate it has been only the rich who have been able to afford to pay for private services to replace them. Most citizens who rely on public services have seen these running down and less able to serve them. Labor's policies have lowered the living standards and quality of life of people who use public hospitals, public schools and public transport, and who rely upon public housing in the State of New South Wales-in other words, the vast majority of the citizens of my State, the vast majority of New South Wales people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look first at the question of law enforcement. There is an old political maxim: the politician who seeks to take credit for the rain must also take the blame for the flood. The New South Wales Labor Party has sought to take much credit for what it has done in the area of law enforcement. It sought to take credit for its efforts in law enforcement, so let us examine the record and see what it is. A police report released last September indicated that the New South Wales crime rate had increased dramatically in just one year. Offences against the person had risen by 20 per cent in one year; fraud was up by 13 per cent in one year; home burglaries had risen by 12 per cent in one year; vandalism was up by 9 per cent in one year; and car theft rose by 6 per cent in one year. That means that in the State of New South Wales, the premier State of Australia, a crime is reported every 76 seconds; a car theft occurs every 8 minutes; a burglary occurs every 9 minutes; and an assault occurs every 30 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the figures released very recently with desperation by the Australian Labor Party (ALP), released just last Monday I believe, show only a small blip in what is an ever-increasing crime rate. The figures show that there were over 198,000 crimes reported in New South Wales in the past six months, that offences against the person, including assault and armed robbery, had again risen, this time by 17.5 per cent. Since a Labor government came to power in New South Wales in 1976, crime has flourished. Total reported crime is up by 170 per cent; car theft is up eight times; vandalism is up four times; and property theft is up by 130 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the numbers of police in my State of New South Wales have not been increased appropriately to deal with this crime wave, it has meant, in effect, that the police workload has doubled. The police of New South Wales have been unable to do what they are technically capable of doing if only they were given the persons and the resources. Finally and recently the Government has decided to pinch, to steal, some of the Opposition policies in relation to the police force in New South Wales. But the public knows whose policies they were and the public knows the origins of the policies to which Labor is now turning. </PARA>
<PARA> A Greiner government will address the problem of crime and will address it effectively. It has released detailed policies on police numbers, and detailed policies on its approach to charging, on its approach to sentencing and on corrective services, and those policies will work. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to health. The record of the Labor Government in New South Wales since 1976 in the field of health has been no better. When the ALP was elected in 1976, New South Wales had one of the best hospital systems in the world. Having worked in a teaching hospital in New South Wales until 1974, I know just how good they were, and just how good our hospital system had been and how proud one could be to be associated with any part of the hospital system in New South Wales. However, since then the course has been steadily and rapidly downhill. By starving the hospital system of funds, by politicising the boards of hospitals, by allowing the reduction of total hospital beds, by pretending that they were increasing hospital beds, we have reached the situation where people in my State cannot get hospital care as easily as they could. The so-called `beds to the west' program was, in fact, a bed reduction program. More hospital beds were closed in some areas of my city of Sydney than were opened in the western suburbs. The result was a net loss of beds. Dispute after dispute with the doctors of New South Wales-most of the disputes unnecessary, most of them provoked by the Government-have merely been one other way in which services have been reduced and made more difficult to obtain. By slamming the door on the development and opening of new private hospitals, the situation has been aggravated even further. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the New South Wales public hospital system is in crisis. There are waiting lists of more than 30,000 patients who face waiting times of up to 2 1/2 years to get beds for surgery. Some of the surgery for which they are waiting involves things like the removal of cataracts-curable if they can get services-hip replacement to relieve the pain of an osteoarthritic hip, and so on. More than 2,000 public hospital beds have been closed, doctor and nurse training has been jeopardised, and there has been, as I say, a ban on private hospital expansion. Budget cuts have forced many other services in our public hospitals to be abandoned. This means more trouble, more pain, more waiting, more suffering and more inconvenience for New South Wales citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been caused by Labor policies over a decade, by Labor governments which have had clear majorities throughout the Parliament of New South Wales, which have returned several times and which have had ample opportunity to demonstrate and put into effect the policies which they advocate. We have seen money available to New South Wales put into projects-circuses I think I could call them-such as the Darling Harbour project. The money for that project has been taken out of that available for essential services such as hospitals with results that are now evident to every citizen of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Another key indicator of the sickness of the hospital system is that nurses are refusing to work in hospitals; they are refusing to stay; they are withdrawing from the work force. One of the reasons why so many beds are closed is that nurses will not work in the system, they will not stay there to service the beds. Their conditions are bad and their morale has been lowered, it is so bad they they have voted with their feet against the system. Labor's response has been one of pretence. We saw those appalling advertisements that appeared in newspapers and on television screens in the last few weeks which set out a situation which did not exist. The costs of those advertisements represented the salaries of not inconsiderable numbers of health workers who could have been in the system had the money been applied where it should have been, to the service of people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that Senator Richardson talked about the period during which Labor had ruled New South Wales. `Ruled' is the word the Labor Party uses. Its rule-if that is the word it wants to use-has been characterised by an ever-diminishing level of service in the health area. The same applies in education. The education system has been the subject of constant criticism, most recently by Labor's former President, John Ducker, who as Chairman of the Public Service Board of New South Wales found `serious deficiencies' in the education system. He cited-and I am quoting nobody other than the former Labor heavy-the high number of consultants in the education system as being totally inconsistent with the so-called back to basics approach to which the Premier said he was committed. Labor's own man, John Ducker, said that the education system had failed his efficiency audit from the Public Service Board of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Three tests are being applied by the people of New South Wales. First, the employers and the general citizenry have a sense that the education system is not delivering what they want. Too many children are leaving the system with no credentials. Too many employers are finding it impossible to employ entrants who have the adequate levels of literacy and numeracy for the jobs which they want to be done. The second test which we can apply is to examine parent satisfaction with the school system. The rush to take children from the public school system into the non-government school system is a matter of record. I think I am not the only senator who was present at a meeting that we held in the Sydney Town Hall in 1983 when not only was the Town Hall full but also the Town Hall surrounds were full of parents who were concerned about their children's education. The third way in which we can measure dissatisfaction in the education system is from the children. There is alienation to an unprecedented degree in New South Wales. There are too many children trying to burn down their schools as their expression of what they think about what is going on in the State. Education is in disarray because standards have not been maintained, because students are not being encouraged to master basic subjects such as maths, spelling and English. I merely report that it is not now permitted for teachers to teach grammar as a discipline in the high schools of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales has the lowest retention rate to year 12 of any mainland State. That is the legacy of the Labor government that we have had for over a decade. The education system has failed among other things because all the specialist schools which have contributed so much in special areas have been closed and there is less choice for students with special talents, special needs or special problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The discipline in our schools has lessened and the parents will attest to this. I recently had a parent telling me about the maths class in which her child was enrolled in which the teacher sat and read a newspaper because he had some discipline problems and therefore decided he would not teach mathematics to the children. That is a breach of faith. The principal of the school should deal with the discipline problems among the students and require the teacher to do the job for which he is drawing a public salary. Drugs, vandalism and violence have become all too prevalent in our schools in New South Wales, particularly in the last few years. The school system has run down and Nick Greiner and the Liberal Party are prepared to overcome some of the problems. Nick Greiner has already released policies to strengthen the public school system. He has released policies which will reverse the flow of students from public to private schools. He has released policies to allow parents to have a greater say in education in New South Wales and he has released policies which will restore confidence and standards in education. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move just briefly over a couple of other areas. In transport, the railways system has become so inefficient and ineffective that the Labor Party has in fact redefined what the phrase `running on time' means for our trains. The redefinition is that a train is on time if it is no more than five minutes late. But recent statistics have shown that even under that redefinition that a train is on time if it is less than five minutes late, only three-quarters of trains run `on time'. In addition, it is well known in New South Wales that lawlessness on trains has become so frequent that it is a worry to allow one's women folk or children to ride unaccompanied on public transport, particularly trains in New South Wales, late at night. </PARA>
<PARA> In housing, the level of homelessness and need in New South Wales has been of great concern to Nick Greiner. He gave a major address to the State Council of the Liberal Party about a week ago in which he stressed the problem of homelessness. He made the point that providing shelter for all the people of New South Wales was one of his priorities and would be one of the priorities of an incoming Greiner Liberal government. It has not been a priority of the Labor Party. What we have seen is the provision of the most inappropriate kind of public housing. Only recently we saw the purchase, development and letting of some of the most expensive waterfront land in Elizabeth Bay for a public housing project. That same money, reapplied in a less grandiose way in other parts of Sydney and other parts of New South Wales, could have provided many more housing units. There are 60,000 people on the public housing waiting lists in New South Wales. There is a shortage of housing land for the citizens of my State. New South Wales has the highest property prices in Australia so it is harder to get a home there. There are 10,000 homeless people in Sydney. We have the highest rents in Australia and we have the lowest vacancy rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I could go on. I could point out the failures in planning, the ways in which the Labor Government of New South Wales has moved to sack any council which has not fitted in with its plan for unrestricted development, the way in which it has passed Acts of parliament to take planning decisions out of the hands of democratically elected local councils. We have seen the way in which it has planned and executed the Darling Harbour project, the monorail, the Eastgate development, the harbour tunnel, the Leura development and many other activities, all of them at the expense of local government and at the expense of the environment and planning regulations and conditions which apply to ordinary citizens in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of New South Wales are sick of the Labor Government. They are sick of Mr Unsworth. The people of New South Wales do not like him and they want a change. The Premier has even decided as a strategy that he will try to present himself as the carefully packaged and presented underdog in the election. Some underdog! Barrie Unsworth is the Premier. He is the incumbent. He is not the challenger, as Nick Greiner is. Barrie Unsworth has a gerrymander operating to his advantage, not against him, as Nick Greiner does. Labor can hold office in New South Wales with just 48 per cent of the two party preferred vote. Nick Greiner needs 52 per cent of the two party preferred vote to gain government. Barrie Unsworth as the underdog? How ridiculous! He is the Premier who has managed to represent his Rockdale seat from the leafy glades of Turramurra, where he was a constituent of Nick Greiner's, and did not even deign to live among his own constituents until latterly. He has scuttled back to Rockdale in the last few weeks for the purpose of the election and for the duration of the election period. He has no right to present himself as anything other than the incumbent Premier, with patronage at his disposal and protected by a substantial majority and a substantial gerrymander. </PARA>
<PARA> We are sick of the Labor Party and its Government in New South Wales. The Premier must call the election which by rights we should have had last December. The people of New South Wales will determine the issue as soon as the election is called. Labor today is up against a clean, young, dynamic, vigorous, determined and tough Opposition under a first rate leader in Nick Greiner; an Opposition which is ready for Government and ready to govern. It is time for change in New South Wales-a change for the better in every way. The people of New South Wales are sick of patronage, cronyism, Labor's Tammany Hall Government and factional dictatorship. They are fed up with the corruption that sticks around the Labor Government, now coming to its end. With Nick Greiner, we look forward to new arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States to benefit the whole community. It will be clean and straightforward government, eager and ready to achieve. All that Nick Greiner needs now is the date of the election. Whenever the contest arrives Nick Greiner and the Liberal Party will win. When he wins, the people of New South Wales will win as well. </PARA>

<PARA> I choose to speak first on health because a report has become available today from the Southern Metropolitan Regional Office of the New South Wales Department of Health, under the signature of its Regional Director, Mr J. D. Campbell. It is dated 4 December 1987 and concerns the capital works program of expenditure in that region on hospitals. It refers to a backlog of expenditure on capital works of $400m. It refers to two major high rise buildings that have walls supported by scaffolding and chicken wire. Several central energy plants are well past their economic life and could fail Department of Industrial Relations safety regulations at any time. Roofs are leaking, listed heritage buildings are decaying and Telecom Australia has advised that it will not service many of the hospitals' PABX telephone systems after December 1988. Clinical diagnostic and treatment equipment is breaking down due to age faster than it can be replaced. This region includes hospitals such as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and major teaching hospitals. It is a disgraceful litany of the rundown and the mis-allocation of funds in New South Wales concerning health. I seek leave to incorporate this report into Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA>Attention: Mr T. Bland, Technical and Support Services</PARA>
<PARA>4 December 1987</PARA>
<PARA>Re: 1988/92-Capital Works Programme</PARA>
<PARA> Enclosed please find this Region's Forward Works submission for consideration for inclusion in the Draft Capital Works Programme for 1988-1992. Following discussion with Mr Bland, the value of projects has been based at June 1988 prices, as in previous years, rather than at December 1987 prices as requested. </PARA>
<PARA> Your attention is drawn to the fact that the backlog of capital project in this Region now exceeds $400 million and the state of major plant equipment and building stock in many hospitals is extremely poor. It is the belief of many of the Area and Regional personnel that disasters have only been averted by ``good luck''. </PARA>
<PARA> Two major high-rise buildings, have walls supported by scaffolding and chicken wire, several central energy plants are well past their economic life and could fail D.I.R. safety inspections at any time; roofs are leaking; listed heritage buildings are decaying; Telecom has advised they will not service many of the hospitals' P.A.B.X. Telephone Systems after December 1988 and clinical diagnostic and treatment equipment is breaking down due to age faster than it can be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> It is requested that this state of affairs be drawn to the attention of the Capital Works Committee and to Treasury rather than continuing the process whereby only one or two new projects are put forward from each Region each year to meet predetermined capital allocations which are grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted that several projects which have only recently been drawn to my attention have not been included in the Forward Works Programme at this time, pending receipt of further detailed information. </PARA>
<PARA> These projects include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) two hundred additional beds at St George Hospital, a suggestion raised by the Minister for Health in discussion with the Area Chief Executive Officer. As demographic studies do not support the need for increased beds in this area, engineering services are not adequate and land is not available, this item has been held in abeyance. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) redevelopment of Karitane Mothercraft Society on its existing site, put forward by the Eastern Area Health Service. It is understood that this project may be in conflict with proposals being developed by the Benevolent Society and further advise is awaited. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) redevelopment of Langton Clinic, on its existing site. No developed proposals have been received from the Eastern Area Health Service. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the component parts of the Programme, the following comments are made:</PARA>
<PARA>Major Works Over $3 Million</PARA>
<PARA> Estimates of costs of works shown in this category should be regarded as broad based estimates only at this time and the refinement of budgets will be dependent on pre planning approvals being given and funds being made available. The estimates shown for St. Vincent's Redevelopment and Prince of Wales Redevelopment is a guesstimate and can only be refined following the preparation of Master Development Control Plans at hospital/or area level. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimates of ongoing development programmes at R.P.A.H., R.A.H.C. and St George Hospitals have been extracted from Master Development Control Plans previously prepared by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Works Under $3 Million</PARA>
<PARA> The number of outstanding works required in this category continues to increase, reflecting the fact that only two such projects have been funded in this Region in the last seven years. Projects of this value are outside the Region's capacity to pay, but would result in significant improvements in clinical services at hospitals' minimal cost, should they proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department is urged to consider seeking to increase the number of small scale projects in this category on the 1988/92 programmes. The lead time for planning projects of this size is reasonably short and if pre planning funds were made available to take the projects up to the end of the tender documentation stage, these would be able to be rapidly brought on to the capital works programme at any time, to utilize under expenditure during the year, if such a proposal was accepted by Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA>Major Plant and Equipment</PARA>
<PARA> The section has again been included in the Programme to alert you to the poor state of the plant in this Region, which has at least 10 hospitals more than 100 years old. </PARA>
<PARA> The current R.M.R. (operating) fund allocation is barely sufficient to cover maintenance contract costs on sophisticated medical/technical equipment, let alone replace or refurbish major engineering plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are considerable operating savings to be made in some of the projects scheduled, but ``up front'' capital allocations are required to enable such saving to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Attention is drawn to the fact that if some funds are not allocated to this area in the near future, emergency allocations may well be required when plant fails. </PARA>
<PARA>Fire Protection Projects</PARA>
<PARA> This Region has a significant backlog of projects in this area because of the age of its buildings. As previously advised, the T.A.S.S. proposal that all funds allocated should be devoted to the installation of early warning systems because this is a broad based recommendation of the Board of Fire Commissioners, is not supported. The Region has some instances where fire separation and egress is of greater importance. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's proposed allocation to the Region of $200,000 is grossly inadequate based on the current need and the size, age and number of institutions and the increasing Code Requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Making Health More Caring</PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the initial 3 year programme to four years in the last year without prior warnings, when many projects had already reached tender documentation state, or were under construction, caused significant problems to this Region. </PARA>
<PARA> If the programme is to be extended, a defined Regional allocation is requested for each financial year so that finite plans can be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Community Health-Capital</PARA>
<PARA> The Darlinghurst Police Station was handed over to the Department of Health this year, on the agreement of the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> The renovation of this facility has been the Region's Number 1 priority in this category for the last four years. It is essential that funds be obtained in 1988/89 or the majority of the building will be left idle in the face of major community health demands. This would also be reprehensible when several other Government Departments made strong bids to secure the building for other essential services. </PARA>
<PARA>Land Acquisition of Sites Vote</PARA>
<PARA>General and Community Health</PARA>
<PARA> The funds provided in this vote in recent years have been inadequate and a larger allocation is required if the Region is to continue its programme of site consolidation both to enable hospital redevelopment and to reduce the need for high cost rent of facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Asbestos Removal</PARA>
<PARA> The Region has now conducted detailed asbestos identification studies on most hospital sites. As a result, all capital works asbestos funds allocated to this Region are utilized for actual removal of asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> Attention is again drawn to the age and state of the building stock in this Region and the resultant heavy volume of asbestos to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase in funding in this area would be of great assistance in enabling ``high activity/high risk'' asbestos areas to be cleared in all 40 hospitals, and reduce the potential risks and possible industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear Medicine, Radiology, Ultrasound and Radiotherapy</PARA>
<PARA>Cardiac Monitoring</PARA>
<PARA>Pathology</PARA>
<PARA> These programmes have only been minimally upgraded from last year, reflecting the inadequate allocations in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>General Issues</PARA>
<PARA> This Office would be pleased to provide updated or more detailed information, particularly relative to budget estimates and cash flow figures, during the period when the Department is negotiating on specific projects with Treasury, rather than waiting until the Draft Capital Works Programme is issued. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Facilities Planning and Construction Management Section would be pleased to meet with you to discuss any matters relative to programme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compare the statement of the backlog of some $400m of expenditure with the sort of expenditure that we have seen on advertising paid for by taxpayers' dollars in the lead-up to this phony election campaign. Admitted to figures-out of the departmental budget-include the following: the Neighbourhood Watch advertisement has been allocated $877,000, and the school discipline advertisement $269,000. Imagine a government that takes out advertising to say that children in schools will be subject to discipline! Imagine even more the fact that these advertisements are run at lunch-time, in the middle of the day when, quite properly, the school children will be at school. No points for guessing at whom those advertisements are truly aimed!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about the Tangara train advertisement? Somebody on talkback radio said this morning that it had been designed to look like Barrie Unsworth's face and that every time the train came in the station people would be reminded of his happy, smiling visage. It has been admitted that those advertisements cost a minimum of $364,000. We have seen Healthline advertisements on television which tell us that if we are sick we can get into a public hospital. There has to be something fundamentally wrong with a system which has to purport to advertise that people can get into a hospital if they are sick. That is why we have governments; that is why we have public sector hospitals. That little budget involved $784,000. How many beds could we have opened up for that? In the so-called re-allocation and new strategy for opening of beds in the west, New South Wales has lost 2,000 public hospital beds. It cost $784,000 to tell us that if we are sick we can get into a hospital. The only trouble is that people know they cannot. That applies whether one has a physical or mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Saturday morning I attended a seminar in Parramatta concerning disabled people, including disabled ethnic people. When it was thrown open to the attendees to put their point of view, one after another the parents and those people affected attacked the Richmond report. In a very emotional statement an Italian gentleman speaking through an interpreter explained how his daughter, living in a hospital and under medication, had managed to maintain a rather normal life. But as a result of the implementation of the Richmond report, in his words they had kicked her out. She is schizophrenic and there is no way that this man and his wife can enforce the taking of the medication that lets their daughter live a normal life. His words were, `Kick out the Ministers who kicked out my daughter'. We saw advertisements from the Water Board telling us that it is doing what it ought to be doing-that is, keeping our beaches clean. Those advertisements cost $447,000. </PARA>
<PARA> If we add up all these admitted expenditures then it comes to a total of $2,741,000, and that is the conservative estimate. The reality is that it is somewhere in the vicinity of $8m of taxpayers' money. Compare that with what we could have got for that sort of money. We can build a new primary school for just under $1m. We can build a secondary school for just over $1m. We can certainly open hospital beds. We can certainly staff the new houses that are being set up in order to take some of the people who are living successfully outside hospitals under the Richmond scheme. That alternative accommodation is not open for the very simple reason that the money is not being made available. It is the problem with the allocation of priorities that has led to this rundown of essential services in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to education. Today I read a report in the Daily Telegraph that tells me, to my amazement, that the State's 22,000 primary school teachers are to be told that their students must learn to read widely, spell accurately, write grammatically and solve mathematical problems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate rose for dinner I had just begun to speak on the question of education and the breakdown of services in education in New South Wales as part of that fundamental breakdown of delivery of service under the Unsworth Labor Government. I was referring to an article in this morning's Daily Telegraph, which reported upon a new document which is being issued to schools. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The State's 22,000 primary school teachers are to be told-</PARA>
<PARA>future tense-</PARA>
<PARA>their students must learn to read widely, spell accurately, write grammatically and solve mathematical problems. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the report these instructions are contained in a 30 page handbook called The Primary Purpose which is currently being distributed to the 1,670 New South Wales government primary schools. What an astonishing thing to say. In 1988, our bicentennial year, after great hardship and great effort we have established Australia, which we are proud to call home, but the New South Wales Government is only now saying that children are to read widely, spell accurately, write grammatically and solve mathematical problems. One wonders what on earth the New South Wales Department of Education has been doing in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The booklet prepared by the Education Department, tells teachers all children must be taught six `major learning areas'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are: language; mathematics; science and technology; human society and its environment; creative and practical arts; and health, physical education and personal development. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential that every student in every primary school in NSW be provided with significant opportunities for learning in all of the six areas in every year as he or she progresses through the primary school . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If it has taken until 1988 for the State Education Department to say that this must be taught in the public sector, is it any wonder that 27 per cent of school children in New South Wales are now in the private sector? Is it any wonder that the waiting lists for the private sector are as long as my arm? Is it any wonder that parents are seeking a proper education for their children as distinct from the one that is made available?</PARA>
<PARA> What a curious thing it is, when we have Minister Dawkins calling for a competitive society, that we have education ministers in Labor governments saying that competition is not good for children. If children are to grow into strong, competing adults, surely competition is something which has to be experienced at the school level. Kids are not to be fooled. The kids know what competition is all about. The kids themselves have a term for subjects which they consider to be of no merit-and the `in' term is `vegie subjects'. The kids cannot be fooled and yet they are being denied, and have been denied prior to this brand new statement-which just happens to coincide with an election-what it is that they are meant to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year our household experienced the Higher School Certificate in New South Wales and we experienced the unknowns and the indeterminate standards of the so-called scaling system which has been introduced. I have yet to meet one person who understands what scaling is. In our case we were fortunate because the particular child was able to get into the course that she wanted to do, and I am also pleased to say that it is mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. The advice that was available, and the understanding or the myths and legends that surrounded the information given about education, was that perhaps we ought not to bother with the three units in mathematics, because two units would probably do. But we were not told that all two-unit subjects were then scaled and that three-unit subjects got their own mark. So the knowledge that there was reward for effort, or that there was indeed some sort of acknowledgment of rigour, was kept quiet because that was about, surely, competition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very worrying to me to see a statement such as this coming out of the New South Wales Education Department, under Minister Cavalier, who is a man fighting to save his own seat. He has suddenly discovered that children in primary school need to read widely, spell accurately, write grammatically and solve mathematical problems. What a revelation!</PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the area of law and order. Senator Peter Baume touched on this area in his speech; indeed, he dealt with it at great length. He gave some quite startling figures. He talked about the increase in crime and the increase of loss of safety to the citizens of New South Wales. An interesting statistic that he did not give on this occasion, but which perhaps is useful for us to have, is that although New South Wales has one-third of the population of Australia it also has one-half of drug related crime. When we look at the question of drug related crime it is very relevant to look at it in two parts. Firstly, there is the rather public aspect of crime. That is the problem of, firstly, the police treatment of criminals. Police ought not be utilised in doing the sort of public relations (PR) exercise presently in effect in New South Wales. Policemen are being put into schools and those schools are supposed to treat them as some sort of PR entity. Indeed there was a letter released by the Labor Party Government in New South Wales asking that policemen collect statistics that could be politically useful to the Government. That has got nothing to do with fighting crime or arresting criminals. The question of the utilisation of the police force, as well as the question of the expansion of the police force, is particularly relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question in this area is that of bail. Almost daily we can pick up our newspapers and read items about people who are out on bail and who are committing serious, fresh offences. Indeed, perhaps the most notorious case is the so-called `Fatal Attraction Case', which, of course, in turn has been picked up from the Oscar award movie Fatal Attraction, where there was some sort of triangle but where the person who committed the alleged crime was on bail and has now absconded. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the question of the prisons themselves. In New South Wales prisons we have an enormous problem with drug usage and, of course, the problem of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS. Any person who lives in a humane society is going to be of the view that when someone goes to gaol he is there to serve a penalty, to atone for the crime that was committed against society. He certainly does not go in there to become a drug addict, to be raped or to be infected with AIDS. Yet that is the situation we presently have in New South Wales gaols. The current incumbent Government will simply not implement a regime whereby all contact visits with prisoners are subject to searching. The Police Minister, Mr Paciullo, states that it would not be satisfactory for contact visits to be searched because they might be subject to some indelicacies. If there are some indelicacies associated with the searching of contact visits in prisons, which will stop the proliferation of drugs and the spread of AIDS, I do not think it is an option, it is a necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth question that is relevant in the public area of law and order is the question of sentencing. Many victims and their families feel a sense of injustice that people who are sentenced do not get a punishment that fits the crime, that they are given a sentence which is never followed through to the literal meaning of that sentence. Under a Greiner government there would be a policy of truth in sentencing. The ordinary person could assume that if somebody were sentenced to X number of years imprisonment that is what he would get, and that if the parole period were set at somewhat less than the remissions and the like that are given under the current system, it would not come off the parole period but only off the head sentence. Truth in sentencing is something that the people of New South Wales have demanded. Again, this goes to the very essence of essential services in our State. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of law and order is more personal, the one that deals with how an individual lifestyle is debilitated by the fact that no adequate system of law and order operates. Senator Baume mentioned the fear many people have for their children travelling on trains. Our public transport system is eating up taxpayers' money at an enormous rate yet we have a system on which it is not safe for teenagers and even young adults to travel alone. There is the fear of the elderly who are virtual prisoners in their own homes, frightened to go out lest they be mugged. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the loss of the family car. I put it that way rather than talk about the great number of automobile thefts which is somehow impersonal and which in many people's minds seems to relate to insurance companies. What I am talking about is the personal sense of violation, when an individual finds that his car, on which he has lavished love and which he has saved very hard to own, has been stolen. An important aspect of a person's life has been broken into. The seats and the radio have been ripped out. The people that I serve in the western suburbs, the area of Sydney where my electorate is situated, are dependent on the private car because public transport is so inadequate. The violation of the vehicles of people who do not have easy access to public transport is even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues of law and order are on two levels. There are the grand, bold figures on the amount of crime that is committed. There are the grand, bold figures of insurance valuations. But what one cannot count, what one cannot put into figures, is the personal violation and anguish suffered by people who have saved, who value their possessions and who have planned. These are very much quality of life issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues that I have touched on-health, law and order, and education-are issues that relate to all of us. They are the issues on which the people of New South Wales will base their decision. I said in the early part of my speech that we were going into an election where the people of New South Wales are being treated cynically by the Government. I pointed out that there had been expenditures of taxpayers' funds to achieve free publicity through a phoney election period to try to dissuade the people of New South Wales from making a sensible decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point Senator Peter Baume raised relates to the gerrymander and Barrie Unsworth trying to make out that he is the underdog. Since I have been a member of this chamber I have heard lots of rhetoric coming from the Government benches about the gerrymander in Queensland. But at least it is up front. It is a bit like barriers to trade. If one is to have a barrier to trade let it be a tariff. Let us see it. Let us not have non-tariff barriers which are hidden and difficult to find. In Queensland the gerrymander is pretty obvious. One can see it. But in New South Wales it is very much more subtle. In New South Wales we, too, have a gerrymander, but it has been achieved not by zones or by declaring that the country vote or the semi-rural vote should have a bias; it has been achieved by utilising projected population figures for 1988. The basis for the fixing of those figures is not available. </PARA>
<PARA> Incredibly, when the people who live on the north coast of New South Wales, which is experiencing a huge growth in population of about 20 per cent a year, go to the polls the electorates will be over quota. Safe Labor seats will be under quota. The balance of those populations will have been redistributed into marginal seats. If that is what the Labor Party means by a clever marginal seat strategy, I understand what it is talking about. It is truly a gerrymander. </PARA>
<PARA> Gerrymander or not, whether we in the Liberal Party require more than 53 per cent of the vote to win government we will do it. The reasons we will do it were set out in the matter of public importance yesterday afternoon. The Labor Party has lost touch with the people. It does not understand the hopes and aspirations of the people. It believed that, in a cynical way, by advertising and manipulation, it could confuse the people sufficiently to believe that it was worthy of another go. </PARA>
<PARA> Neville Wran made many statements while he was Premier. Perhaps the most meaningful statement was this: No government that has been in power for 11 years deserves another try. Neville Wran said that in 1976. What the electorate has come to know and understand is that time is up. What the Labor Party is asking for in New South Wales is 16 years in government because, with four-year terms, if it is returned at the next election that is the term of office it will be seeking from the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Neville Wran said that no government that has been in power for 11 years deserves another try. He was right. New South Wales deserves a change for the better. New South Wales deserves good, honest government that will come in the personage of Nick Greiner. New South Wales deserves a good health system, a fine education system, a decent system of law and order, a housing policy that puts people before cynicism, the completion of a road system abandoned in 1976, a public transport system that again serves the needs of the people but, more particularly, a government that acknowledges that it is the people who have toiled the hardest who are threatened with superannuation tax changes, who have been threatened by timed telephone calls, who are threatened by the bad policies of the malappropriation of money in New South Wales, who know that the time has come. They will not be used and abused any more. Neville Wran got it right. Eleven years is enough. It is time for a change for the better. The time for the Labor Government in New South Wales is up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not heard five different speeches. We have heard the same speech five times over. We are about to hear a speech from one failed House of Representatives candidate while another interjects against an Australian Labor Party member who also failed to win a House of Representatives seat in 1969. At least I have never thrown away a House of Representatives seat. But for a small 9.1 per cent swing I would have been in the House of Representatives in 1969. But the person who interjected and the next person to speak already have a history of throwing away a Federal seat and being rejected by the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said before, we have heard the same speech delivered five times. What a pity it is that former Senator Misha Lajovic is not here. I had a great admiration for the loyalty he showed to New South Wales and to the Liberal Party when he was here. It did not matter how badly the Liberals were going; he was here to fight for them when they were going at their worst. He never once deviated in his defence of them. In the 1984 election campaign I really enjoyed, as I am sure Senator Childs did, his vigorous defence of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party in those days. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we will have a lot to say about the New South Wales election over the next few weeks, until whenever it is held. We will say it in the belief that we are about to change the tide one way or the other. We will all sprout thousands of words here. At times it will get heated. We will all think that we are having an influence over the New South Wales election. But when I look around this chamber I see only about three New South Wales voters, unless anyone at the table lives in Queanbeyan, and I have a rough idea which way they will vote. So I find it rather pointless that they are lecturing each other about the issues in the New South Wales election when they have already made up their mind which way they will vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In one way I am pleased with the New South Wales Liberal Party. It has finally got over its shell shock from Neville Wran. I have never said this publicly before but I remember very well in 1981 going into the tally room in New South Wales. I do not know whether my senatorial colleagues from New South Wales were present then; Senator Childs might have been there. The tally room was on about the fifth floor. Of course, Wran had won in a landslide in 1978 and everyone expected the big swing to come back. That night I really understood the Liberals' attitude to Neville Wran. Mr Carlton and quite a few of the leading lights in the Liberal Party were there. No one knew who I was. When Mr Wran came into the tally room, a big flood of reporters came in and I was edged into the Liberal camp. I was physically pushed across into the Liberal camp. I listened to all the comments from the New South Wales Liberals at that time. I heard how they hated Neville Wran. The comments went on for five minutes until one of them really put his foot in it when he said, `Oh, no, if only he were a Liberal. If only he had led the Liberal Party'. I suggested to the person making the comment that as the window was open and we were on the fifth floor, he should end it all right then. Nevertheless, he did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Neville Wran had a major effect on the New South Wales Liberal Party. I think we would all concede that it was a very depressing effect. He was a consummate politician. He was able to dominate the proceedings of the New South Wales Parliament with his intellectual vigour. He also had an ability that I have never seen in any other politician-to mix with all levels of society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins says, after 10 years! The man ruled the State for 10 years. Wran's great strength, which I think was underestimated by the Liberal Party, was his ability to move in all sections of society and discuss a variety of subjects with them. He was always at ease. We have seen many other great political leaders, such as Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser. They were never at ease with the public, be it at a garden party, doing a pub crawl or anything else. One always had a sense that they were not at ease and not relating smoothly to the rest of the voting public. That was the great ability that Neville Wran brought to politics, as well as his intellectual vigour and absolute domination. I suppose that is why he wiped out so many Liberal leaders in a 10-year period. There were about six or seven of them. Five of the seven were wiped out of the Parliament itself. That is not a bad track record in politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will move on from that point. A point has been raised about the gerrymander in New South Wales. Of course, there is a clear distinction between gerrymandering and malapportionment. It is very easy to measure malapportionment. It does not exist at a Federal level. It hardly exists in any of the States. It does exist in Queensland. It exists in Western Australia, although that has been modified recently. Basically, a definition of malapportionment is where the distribution of seats results in many seats being out of kilter with others. That is easily defined. The Gini index or anything else can measure malapportionment very easily. But the word `gerrymander' implies something different. I think this is what Senator Bishop was trying to allude to. There can be a gerrymander even though every seat is of equal enrolment. Basically, a gerrymander results from a government trying to concentrate the votes of its opposition in one seat, leaving a majority-but only a bare majority-in the marginal seats and not having enormous majorities in the seats that it holds. That is gerrymandering. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a euphemism. In terms of political studies, there is a distinct difference between malapportionment and gerrymandering. Malapportionment may well be regarded as one element of gerrymandering. What I am trying to draw to Senator Bishop's attention has yet to deflect from the points she has made, so I do not know why she is interrupting.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am. She may well be able to use the distinction I am using to make her point more validly in future. But I am pointing out the distinction, which too many people do not recognise, between malapportionment and gerrymandering. I was going on to say that with equal electorates there can still be gerrymandering. In other words, if the New South Wales lower House electorates all averaged 30,000 electors, there could still be a gerrymander. Gerrymandering is drawing the boundaries to maximise one's position. Malapportionment is not an essential element of that but is quite often associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are difficulties in determining what a gerrymander is. Those difficulties come because there is no scientific measure; it is a subjective judgment. Again I say to Senator Bishop that none of this deflects from the points she has made, so she should just listen. There is no politically scientific method of measuring a gerrymander. An intentional gerrymander of the sort I am describing can be avoided with independent commissioners. Basically, that is what we have done at a national level. By having independent commissioners one tends to avoid that. But, of course, inadvertent gerrymanders occur. Historically, the classic example is Melbourne. Anyone who knows Melbourne knows that Labor is excessively strong in the west, very strong in the middle and the central suburbs and very strong in the north. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s there were massive Labor majorities in seats such as Melbourne Ports, Melbourne, Gellibrand, et cetera. Even if all the boundaries had been equal, Labor would have been disproportionately represented in the national Parliament because of this massive concentration of majorities in one area. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in Melbourne and may not have happened in Sydney-it may be the case in Sydney-is that the patterns have changed. Many of the working class members of society in Melbourne and lower middle class members have moved to the outer ring, to eastern suburbs, to seats such as La Trobe, Casey and Holt. They all moved out there. Consequently, many of the middle class members have moved to the inner city area because they can afford the higher property prices and, therefore, are charged lower transport costs. The gentrification of the inner city, as I understand it, is the same in Sydney as it is in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, we are at the halfway point of the tide; that is, Labor still has enough strength in the inner city areas with its traditional supporters to absorb the incoming middle class whether they are doctors, architects or whatever. That is very much one of the reasons why the Labor Party has been successful in the 1970s and 1980s. It would be a matter of concern and worry-not to the Opposition but to Labor-that once the tide or the graph intersects and goes past a certain point many of those inner city seats that were once Labor Party strongholds will become marginal Liberal seats and maybe eventually strong, true blue Liberal seats. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background honourable senators have heard the accusation that the New South Wales boundaries are gerrymandered. The evidence of that may well be true; they may be gerrymandered. The Opposition has to prove whether that is an inadvertent gerrymander, like the one I have described in Melbourne, or a real one. The Opposition has failed to do that tonight. It has not mentioned or has not had the intestinal fortitude to name one commissioner who was crooked. </PARA>

It will not because it knows that is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real riggers of electoral boundaries in New South Wales were those who got loose after 1965. When the boys from George Street and Ash Street got loose there was a majority in the Parliament. That is when there was a redistribution after every election. That is when there was not only gerrymandering but also malapportionment and I will say that the commissioners and those who redistributed after 1965 were no more than Liberal stooges. There was no independence about them. They had it down to an absolute art form. </PARA>

Recently a seat had 2,000 electors in it up until the last redistribution, and there were 38,000 and 40,000 in other seats. Did Senator Panizza, Senator Baume or Senator Messner ever criticise these sorts of boundaries?

They are very quick to do so; they will put out judgments and Press releases. Only the other day a National Party scrutineer was convicted in the courts for filling out ballot papers.

It is always the electoral system that has robbed the Liberal Party. It sounds like the Labor Party of the 1960s. All Labor members used to whinge then but at least we have matured to recognise that a party must win 50 per cent of the vote and must win the hearts and minds of the people. Whingeing about the system will get the Liberal Party absolutely nowhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bishop raised some serious issues tonight when she mentioned education, law and order, and similar issues. I would be the last one to say that there are no problems in any one of those issues in any Australian State. The judgment we have to exercise-not I, because I am not a voter in New South Wales-is: who is best placed to solve those issues? When I first looked at the New South Wales Liberal Party I noticed Nick Greiner, the Leader, and then of course there is Mr Murray, the Leader of the National Party. I wonder which tail will wag the dog. The Liberal Party may even be able to make out a case that it is a credible alternative government. However, what will happen when it has to go into coalition with the National Party of New South Wales with all the old, boring rednecks?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Childs for that intervention; 40 per cent of the coalition is the National Party. It will get back to its old pork-barrelling tricks-the Liberals free marketing will have to go out the door and the Liberal Party will be dictated to by the National Party of New South Wales. Then the Liberals will go to their State branches and councils and say, `The imperfection of this so-called Liberal State government is really our country cousins, the hicks from the bush, who will not let us get on with ruling the State'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We put up with that in Victoria during the 1920s, the 1930s and the 1940s and I feel sorry for the Liberal Party because it will have to reduce the few standards it has to accommodate the National Party. It was so bad in Victoria in the early 1950s that some Liberal leaders had to say, `No more coalition with the National Party.' Victoria actually had a Country Party Government for eight years. In the end, after eight years of rule, the Country Party Government had built five high schools. When it left office, Melbourne, which I think had 55 per cent of the population, was left with four high schools and the country areas had 20. Those are the sorts of priorities of a country party, and the sorts of priorities it will put on any potential Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Greiner, therefore, might deliver a policy speech in one, two, or three weeks time, but he cannot guarantee any promises will be kept because he knows that Mr Murray and the redneck boys from the Country Party and National Party will put their oars in any spare money that is around. They will slosh it into all the useless dams they can find around the State and all the useless National Party causes that have blighted the nation for the past 20, 30, or 50 years. If ever a tribunal were established to try people in this country for failed contributions to politics, one would start with Earle Page and work through every National Party leader to Bjelke-Petersen. It would not be hard to get the jury of 12 to agree on their lack of contribution to Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to go back to 1971 when John McEwen stood over McMahon over the devaluation-revaluation issue, which was one of the most shameful aspects in Australian politics. Four years before that Jack McEwen vetoed the best qualified-maybe not the best leader-Liberal Party candidate for the leadership when he said that Bill McMahon could not become Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to go back to the 1950s to look at the efforts of the Faddens of the world and how they debauched Budgets in this country. One can go all the way back to Earle Page and his destabilisation around the start of the Second World War when internecine faction warfare between the Liberal and National or Country parties of the time was regarded as more important than the defence of this nation. </PARA>

He played a major role in trying to destroy the Country Party in Western Australia. Through his manipulations he managed to split the Country Party in Western Australia, first into two parties and then into three parties. They have only just recently reunited. I am certain that Senator Crichton-Browne would be worried for the future, because he knows that the National Party is making a slight resurgence in Western Australia. Even if that party were ever given the slightest glimmer of hope of returning to power in that State, again there would be the problem of the National Party trying to dictate to it and to its leader, who is-I am sorry; I am fairly well read in Australian politics but I have no idea who the leader is--</PARA></TALK.START>

The only State that cannot get its act together in this regard is Victoria. In Victoria we have Mr Kennett leading. The last three challenges to his leadership have emanated at the time of the last three spring racing carnivals. Every spring carnival the plutocrats in Victoria come down and say to the Liberal State members, `You have got to get rid of that Kennett'. They all have a run at him and they all want to get rid of him, but they all want to take his place so they will not vote for each other. There is this terrible Mexican stand-off situation in which there are 50 State Liberal members; 40 want to get rid of Kennett but as soon as they are eliminated in a ballot they vote for the other bloke to give themselves a chance next time. Maybe we will have another challenge next spring carnival. Perhaps the Liberals will break with tradition and take him on during the autumn racing carnival-the Australia Cup-Newmarket double.

<PARA> I am tending to stray a little from the subject of New South Wales. However, I am tempted to move an amendment to the Opposition motion to insert the words `Tasmania and Queensland' and remove any reference to New South Wales, because I think that is far more appropriate. We have only to look at the Australian economy to see which two States have the highest unemployment in Australia-Queensland and Tasmania. Nearly all the economic indicators show that Labor-run States have a far more vibrant and growing economy than any of the Liberal States. For example, the New South Wales unemployment figure is down to 7.5 per cent and it is continuing to fall. </PARA>

In terms of depth of ability it is far in advance of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Who are the New South Wales shadow Ministers? Who are the faceless men of the New South Wales Liberal Party?

However, we had a triple-bunger. I invite Senator Bishop, on that basis, to go up to Queensland at the next State election, where they have had 30 years of government, and tell them that 11 years is enough and that they should get out. Will Senator Bishop do that? Of course she will not. Did Senator Bishop trip off down to Victoria when the Liberals ruled from 1955 to 1982? Here is the crucial question: Did Senator Bishop vote Labor in 1976 on the basis that the Liberal Party had been there for 11 years and had had enough? Of course she did not vote for the Labor Party. She probably forgot to vote. She was too busy putting right wing uglies into the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party. That is probably the case. This point about 11 years--</PARA>

That is fair enough. However, it really does not stand up, as I have said. Senator Bishop will not be proceeding up to Queensland and lecturing the Queensland National Party that, in fact, it has had 30 years in government and it is time to go. Nor would she do it anywhere else, because she is a conservative loyalist. Nevertheless, I think that we have dealt with that particular point. In summary, because I would hate to eat into Senator Michael Baume's time, I would just  say--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In summary, this is, if one likes, the second act of about a 15-act play that we will have over the next few weeks in which everyone gets very earnest about New South Wales. Some honourable senators probably will not get the same quaver in their voice as Senator Bishop, some will not have the concerned fluency of Senator Peter Baume and some will not have the waspish enthusiasm of Senator Puplick. Nevertheless, it will all flow forward, all against the pathetic backdrop that probably it will not influence one voter out there. </PARA>
<PARA> What we really should be concentrating on doing here is getting on with the legislation and getting on with debating national issues about which honourable senators opposite might get some publicity and have some effect. Really, I suppose that is what this is about. What honourable senators opposite are really saying by raising these issues time and time again is that this is a no confidence motion against Nick Greiner. Apparently he needs help. I ask honourable senators opposite why they do not just let him do his own job. Why do they have to keep running up to Canberra and, behind the wall of privilege, try to put forward propositions for Nick Greiner? Deep in their heart of hearts honourable senators opposite know that Nick Greiner is not good enough. They know they have to help him out; they have to prop him up. I just wonder about that. The only value Canberra has ever been to Nick Greiner was when he sloshed the $3,900,000 through the Australian Capital Territory branch of the Liberal Party to avoid disclosure. That is the only value Canberra has ever been to Nick Greiner. It is the only value it will be this time. Those opposite criticise us for disclosure when in the last election in 1984, $3,900,000 passed from the Australian Capital Territory branch of the Liberal Party to the New South Wales branch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) did fulfil his threat and speak for half an hour and I think I detected at most five minutes of that time that had anything to do with New South Wales. I congratulate him on his relevance which was minimal. I also note that his expectations about New South Wales are equally off the beam. If he wishes to engage in comments about the former Premier of New South Wales and what an impact he had, then I feel that I should recount to him an incident that occurred when I spoke to Mr Rex Jackson a couple of years ago. I have not recounted this before, but I will now. It relates, of course, to Mr Neville Wran. I was in the company of a very distinguished person who can act as a witness if anyone in this chamber is concerned about it. When I saw Mr Jackson outside the Commonwealth office block I said to him, `Rex, how will you go with all your troubles?'. He said, `I will be sweet, mate. If they get me they will need a new Premier of New South Wales within a week'. What interested me about that conversation is that exactly one week before Mr Rex Jackson went up for trial there was a new Premier of New South Wales. I just wonder whether Mr Jackson's comment was a prescient one and I just wonder why, after 10 allegedly highly successful years, the Premier of New South Wales decided to step down.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> While the Minister was happily berating us I noticed he started off talking about me as a failed House of Representatives candidate. In fact, I was a successful candidate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my cousin, Senator Peter Baume. I beat him twice. On the criteria used by the Minister in an endeavour to belittle me Mr Kerin is a twice defeated candidate and yet does the Minister say that Mr Kerin is a man of no status or someone who should not be taken any notice of? I am certain Mr Kerin would be most interested to be aware of the good senator's apparent opinion of him. Because the Minister has used this phrase quite often, I might mention to him that after I won the seat in 1975-I held it again in 1977 with around about the same narrow majority as befits a swinging seat-in 1980 when there was something like a three and a half per cent swing against the Liberal Party throughout Australia, I doubled my majority and instead of being theoretically ninth on the pendulum to go, I held the seat very comfortably indeed which is obviously not fitting in, unfortunately, with the Minister's categorisation. The Minister is ultimately right-I was defeated, not as a candidate but as a member. I was defeated after a Mr Bob Hawke-he must be a man of integrity because he keeps telling us he is-came to the Dapto showground four days before the election and before a crowd of miners and steel workers who were concerned about their employment future. He said to them, `Under a Labor Government there will be no sackings in the steel industry. There will be no retrenchments in the coal industry'. Eight thousand job losses later the man of integrity is not a regular visitor to Dapto. It strikes me as quaint that a man like the Minister should hold me up as a failed candidate when, in fact, I lost because of a disgraceful, dishonest and corrupt promise which that man as Leader of the Opposition at that time had no intention or capacity to fulfil, which was part of a pattern of promises which were corrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result, the Opposition parties in New South Wales will have to win something like 53 per cent of the vote because of the honest, upright and proper way the criteria was set for these commissioners by the corrupt Labor Party in New South Wales. So we have a situation where the Minister said, `Yes, it is true'. I must say that he beat me to the punch. He said, `Back in the 1960s the Labor Party kept whingeing'. It kept whingeing because it had to get 51 per cent of the vote to win and yet we are somehow disgraceful for bringing to the Parliament's attention that in New South Wales we have to get 53 per cent of the vote to win. I think the Minister has a set of double standards which are immensely appropriate because they are the double standards that exist throughout this Ministry and this Government. They are the double standards that have brought this Government into contempt with the people of Australia, as is evidenced by the by-election result in Adelaide and as will be evidenced as the tide at last turns against people who are outstanding at promising and abysmal at performing. I now want to examine their style of gerrymander. We have heard a fanciful and semantic debate from the Minister about what a gerrymander really means. I say this: a gerrymander is in fact what this Government has done with the Aboriginal Commission-only this one is a `gerryhander', because there it has even greater variations between the numbers involved in providing one representative than it has even in Queensland. Now with that kind of `gerryhander', I can say only that the Government has learnt well, because in those instances where it can get away with doing it openly, it does it openly; and in those situations where it has to do it in a covert way, as in New South Wales, it will do it covertly. The Labor Party is a horses for courses party; there is no doubt about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1987</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend various taxation laws to give effect to a range of policy decisions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The more important amendments to be made relate to provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> They include measures to encourage the development of off-shore banking in Australia through a withholding tax exemption for interest paid to non-residents by off-shore banking units. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital gains tax roll-over relief is being given for certain reorganisations of resident unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to correct certain deficiencies in the taxation of lump sum superannuation and similar payments are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will remove special concessional treatment for expenditure on buildings for scientific research or other research or development purposes and on the development of certain computer software. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments include further concessions to permit shelf companies to satisfy `common ownership' tests contained in the income tax law, modifications to thin capitalisation provisions and measures to extend the coverage of the income tax law to a range of activities in off-shore areas and external territories. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of technical amendments will correct anomalies and deficiencies in the taxation laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now further outline the more significant measures contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Offshore Banking Units</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision, announced on 1 July 1986 and expanded on 9 April 1987, to provide an interest withholding tax exemption to facilitate offshore banking in Australia, primarily for dealings in foreign currencies with non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption will be confined to banks that are subject to the Banking Act, State banks and other financial institutions authorised to deal in foreign exchange which are gazetted by the Treasurer to be off-shore banking units. </PARA>
<PARA> An offshore banking unit may be a separate department of a bank or other financial institution, keeping separate accounts, or a separately incorporated body. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from interest withholding tax interest and amounts in the nature of interest paid by offshore banking units on specified borrowings contracted for after 1 July 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme of the legislation allows an offshore banking unit to borrow or accept deposits of foreign currency funds either overseas or on the domestic market or of Australian currency from non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is basically intended that they deal with these funds only in three ways: by on-lending them to non-residents, depositing them with another offshore banking unit, or in purchasing foreign securities. </PARA>
<PARA> To preserve Australia's withholding tax base, and in recognition of the practicalities of tracing and monitoring the application of particular borrowings, any misapplication of funds that attract the concession provided are to bear a special income tax at a penal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax will be declared and imposed by an associated Bill about which I will speak shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the basic concept of separate dealings by offshore banking units in foreign currency transactions, any foreign income tax losses incurred by offshore banking units from outside banking business may be offset only against subsequent profits from that business. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be similar quarantining of offshore banking income for foreign tax credit purposes, precluding the transfer of excess foreign tax credits within a company group of which the offshore banking unit is a member. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to have a direct revenue cost of $2m annually which may be offset by higher company tax collections on offshore banking business profits. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Roll-Over Relief</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Effect is being given to the proposal announced on 29 September 1987 to extend roll-over relief (that is, deferral of liability) from tax on capital gains for certain reorganisations of resident unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> Roll-over relief will be given where a resident company is interposed between a unit trust and its unit holders who dispose of their units to the company in exchange solely for non-redeemable shares in the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a reorganisation will qualify for the relief where it is entered into, or commenced, after 9 December 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The reorganisation must be carried out by a direct exchange of units for shares or by redemption or cancellation of the units and separate issue of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The interposed company will be required to elect that the roll over provisions apply and declare that eligibility conditions have been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Unit holders will separately elect for roll-over. </PARA>
<PARA> They will thereby be able to choose, for capital gains tax purposes, between having their units treated as disposed of at the time of the reorganisation or to defer any capital gains liability until they later dispose of the exchange shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Shares received in exchange for units acquired before 20 September 1985 will also be taken to have been acquired before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> For the company, an effect of its election may be to have an appropriate proportion of the units taken as having been acquired before 20 September 1985 and therefore not subject to the capital gains and capital losses provisions on a later disposal-the proportion to be determined by reference to the net value of assets of the unit trust that were acquired before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> For the remainder of units taken to have been acquired on or after 20 September 1985, cost bases will be determined by reference to the cost bases of the assets of the unit trust that were acquired on or after that date reduced by any liabilities of the trust attributable to those assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of this proposal is such that a reliable estimation of the potential revenue effect cannot be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligible Termination Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains measures, announced on 12 January 1987, that will amend the law relating to the taxation of lump sum superannuation and kindred payments. The amendments remedy shortcomings in the law that have been exploited so as to defeat the Government's objectives in the retirement incomes area. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Bill will ensure that a lump sum payment made after 12 January 1987 on the death of a superannuation fund member will be taxed as an eligible termination payment if the payment is made as an alternative to a superannuation pension or annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> This is consistent with a policy of discouraging the conversion of retirement incomes into tax free lump sums, and will overcome arrangements by which some superannuation funds dress up as tax free lump sums payments that are in substance a commutation of a pension or annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also close a loophole that allowed persons who are not dependants to receive superannuation and other termination payments tax free on the death of a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Death benefits paid after 12 January 1987 will be exempt from tax only if paid to dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of measures is being introduced to ensure that annuities purchased with rolled-over eligible termination payments do not qualify for tax concessions unless they provide genuine retirement incomes for the taxpayer and the taxpayer's dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> The concessions are the deferment of tax on the eligible termination payment and tax exemption for the income derived by the annuity issuer from that business. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the new requirements is that the annuity contract must provide for the annuity to commence to be payable by the annuitant's sixty-fifth birthday. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure will limit the class of persons who may be nominated under a roll-over annuity contract to receive residual benefits on the purchaser's death. </PARA>
<PARA> It will exclude adult children who are not financially dependent on the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA> By a further amendment only the spouse of a deceased annuitant will be allowed to roll over an eligible termination payment received as the residual capital value or commutation of a roll-over annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other rules being introduced for roll-over annuities are aimed at securing timely release of an annuitant's income entitlements once age 65 is reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Those rules are in two groups. </PARA>
<PARA> One will set upper limits on any capital payments permitted under the contract on termination of the annuity after age 65. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the other group of rules the Commissioner of Taxation will look to whether the annuity contract permits unreasonable deferral of any annuity income payable after 65. </PARA>
<PARA> Together the rules reflect a policy that tax exemption for issuers of roll-over annuities cannot be justified beyond the normal retirement age if the tax payable on the relevant annuity income continues to be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out matters that the Commissioner will have regard to in applying the rules. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the guaranteed component of an annuity and any bonus (or supplementary) component are required to be considered separately and according to different principles. </PARA>
<PARA> More detailed explanations can be found in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment will exempt from the eligible termination payment taxing provisions the residual capital value of a deferred roll-over annuity paid to a dependant on the death of the purchaser during the deferment period. </PARA>
<PARA> This will bring the tax treatment of those payments into line with payments to dependants of deceased superannuation fund members and approved deposit fund depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> The various amendments affecting roll-over annuities are to apply to annuities purchased after 12 January 1987, the date of announcement of the measures. </PARA>
<PARA> As a complementary measure, immediate annuities not purchased wholly with rolled-over eligible termination payments are to be required to satisfy conditions similar to those for roll-over annuities if the earnings of annuity issuers from that business are to be tax free. The conditions are to apply from the time of purchase, rather than at age 65 and apply to relevant annuities purchased after 9 December 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> A further measure will treat de facto spouses on the same basis as legal spouses for the purposes of the lump sum payments taxing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also clarify two matters: firstly, that a roll-over payment to a personal or self-employed person's superannuation fund does not qualify as a tax deductible contribution to the fund; and secondly, that an annuity is regarded for these purposes as being presently payable-and therefore, an immediate annuity-at all times after the commencement of the first payment period. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of measures is expected to result in a net revenue gain of $4m in 1986-87 and $30m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development Activities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill implements two changes announced on 20 November 1987 to the concessions for expenditure on scientific research and other qualifying research and development activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The three year write-off for expenditure on the construction or acquisition of buildings used exclusively in these activities will be removed, except where the taxpayers who incur the expenditure had committed themselves to the construction or acquisition before 21 November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will ensure more efficient use of the revenue available for research and development activities by focusing upon more productive, and innovative, investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change is an anti-avoidance measure to deny deductibility as `research and development activities' for expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987 on the development of computer software not intended for multiple application by persons not associated with the developer. </PARA>
<PARA> Other changes arising from the Government's review of the research and development tax concession which were also announced on 20 November 1987 are proposed to be introduced in this sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes included in the Bill under this heading are estimated to save $5m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>`Shelf' Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes measures complementary to those introduced in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1987 to permit a newly-incorporated company, commonly referred to as a `shelf' company, to be eligible for various company grouping provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> One change will backdate shelf company eligibility to the income year in which each of the relevant grouping provisions was first made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change will extend the operation of the grouping concessions to shelf companies acquired by the mechanism of issuing new shares and redeeming the subscriber shares in the shelf company. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Matters</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The remaining measures contained in the Bill are not matters of major significance and I shall not take up the time of the Senate by dwelling on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed explanations are set out in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> For immediate purposes I note that they deal with the following subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> First, some technical redefinition of offshore areas is being made, the main change being to amend Australia's taxing rights over certain sea installations used for tourism, recreation, business or transport activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Unintended consequences of the imputation system legislation are being remedied so that non-resident life assurance companies are freed of divided withholding tax on any unfranked dividend income attributable to superannuation and certain life assurance policies derived through their Australian branches on or after 1 July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> More generous transitional rules are being given to some companies with substituted accounting periods to enable them to rearrange their debt/equity ratios to comply with the thin capitalisation measures contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax rebate for taxable bonuses received under short-term life assurance policies is being extended under an agreement with the Western Australian Government to policies issued by the State Government Insurance Corporation of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a minor technical amendment is being made to the quarterly provisional tax system's legislation; a redundant machinery provision is being removed from the sales tax law; and full effect is being given to the abolition of stamp duty and tax on transfers of debentures in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX (OFFSHORE BANKING UNITS) (WITHHOLDING TAX RECOUPMENT) BILL 1987</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will formally declare and impose an income tax, the liability for which may arise under one of the measures contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1987, about which I have just spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> That liability may arise in respect of certain dealings by banks and other financial institutions which are declared to be offshore banking units in accordance with provisions being inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act by that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Those provisions are part of measures designed to provide an interest withholding tax exemption for offshore borrowings by such units in order to facilitate the conduct of offshore banking in Australia, primarily for dealings in foreign currencies with non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Liability for an income tax, at a penal rate, could apply if an offshore banking unit misapplies borrowings that qualify for the withholding tax exemption, for example, by on-lending to residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax is to be based on a formula contained in the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax is a sanction against the use of the funds that have been exempted from withholding tax otherwise than, broadly, for offshore banking business, but may be subject to remission in appropriate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes that income tax and declares the rate of the tax to be 300 per cent of the formula amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

Of course, while there may be some merit in the suggestion of the Jackson Committee that the family law division of the Federal Court provide for dual commissions for family law judges to also sit in the general divisions, in my view the transfer of unrelated jurisdiction to the Family Court will not, as is suggested by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), help to enhance its standing in any real way. In fact, such a proposal also goes against the views expressed by the Family Law Council in its 1986-87 annual report. In appendix 4 of that report, the council said that it would view with some concern any attempt `to graft on to the existing structure of family law jurisdictions which have little or no relevance to family law'. I truly fail to see how, in the Attorney-General's words, by broadening the jurisdiction of the Family Court judges this way, appointments to the Family Court will be more attractive. That is clearly the intention; but obviously the method being used will have absolutely no compelling appeal-quite the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such an ad hoc addition to the Court's jurisdictions can only, I suspect, heighten the professional condescension and worsen the community's perception, more so than it already is, of the Family Court, as it must imply inevitably providing the court with real work and consequently creating real judges. Of course, I recognise the efforts of the Attorney-General in attempting to raise the status and the self-esteem of the Family Court and perhaps the self-perception of the Family Court and its practitioners. Unfortunately, it is quite plain that the message contained in this Bill will not achieve those ends, admirable as they may be. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Liberal Party says in its policy, for most Australians family law is the most important single field of the law. This flows inevitably, to quote Mr Justice Kirby, from the fact that marriage still forms the basic economic and social unit within Australia's society for the vast majority. The importance of this statement must be reflected in appropriate and responsible legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many matters of controversy, both in this Bill and in the Jackson Committee report, which require full debate and determination and, in my view, these matters ought, quite properly, not be rushed now, through this piece of legislation, and cobbled together in an ad hoc way, but, rather, examined with some considerable care and deliberation by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again in this second reading debate to state the Opposition's views in relation to the amendment to the motion for the second reading, which amendment Senator Macklin moved before the lunch break. That is, he proposes that at the end of the motion, That the Bill be read a second time, the following words be added:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ``, but the Senate considers-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the salaries and conditions of service of Family Court judges should more closely approximate those of Federal Court judges, as, in its opinion, the expertise, workload and status of the judges in each court are equivalent; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the passage of this Bill should be seen as just one step in a process leading to the possible amalgamation of the Family and Federal Courts.</PARA>
<PARA>When I opened the debate on the second reading motion earlier today, I had not had notice of that amendment. I only learnt of it by an earlier draft. I do not know whether it was circulated, but it was certainly discussed during the early stages of the debate, but after I had spoken. Now, after discussions that the Democrats have had with the Minister at the table and with me, they have modified their original proposal, and just before lunch Senator Macklin moved the modified amendment which I have just read. The Opposition is not opposed to the sentiments that are contained in the proposed amendment. We certainly are prepared to support it in general terms, though I might say they have become more general as a result of the discussions that I have referred to as we could not have supported the amendment in its original form, which was too specific about the salaries of Family Court judges and the progressing of the Family Court's amalgamation with the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to explain the views of the Opposition in relation to these proposals. In the first place, the whole question of the future of the Family Court, which has been the subject of a good deal of comment in the course of the second reading debate, should have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Before the end of the Budget session last December when the Government agreed to separate the consideration of a Bill amending the Family Law Act from consideration of another major amendment to the Family Law Act, which the Opposition was happy to accommodate for an early passage before Christmas, we moved that the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987 should be referred to the Senate Committee for consideration of the very difficult questions which this Bill partly, but not completely, addresses. </PARA>
<PARA> The salaries of judges and the possible future amalgamation of the Family Court with the Federal Court would have been appropriately considered by the Senate Committee. It would have assisted this debate today and made it more productive had we had the benefit of the more detailed consideration of these matters by a Senate committee. It could have taken evidence from numbers of experts in this field and although its report may not have been ready for this week it could have been completed in a fairly short time. It would have been of great assistance to the Senate and we would have made a more valuable contribution to the solution of this very difficult problem about the jurisdiction and the future of the Family Court if we had such help from a Senate committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Australian Democrats, for some reasons best known to themselves, declined to support that reference to a Senate committee last December and we are now considering this Bill today with the need to come up with some amendments of our own, which I have referred to in my previous speech on the Bill, which we will deal with in committee. I might say that it would have been much more satisfactory as well for the Government, which has now discovered it needs to make a great number of amendments to its own Bill, as introduced into the Parliament at the end of October last year and which it sought to rush through the Parliament before the end of the Budget session last year, to make it adequate. The Government first gave notice of its committee stage amendments this morning. That is another good reason why this Bill should have been given further consideration than it has been, very suitably by the Senate Committee. The two propositions in the amendment proposed by the Democrats to the motion for the second reading of the Bill-not as amendments to the Bill-could have been more satisfactorily dealt with in a committee consideration. However, they have both been the subject of a good deal of debate in the second reading stage. They are the status of the Family Court in the eyes of the community and of the professions that are concerned with its operations and the future of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter-namely, the question of salaries of judges of the Family Court-is a subject with which I was very closely associated through my years as Attorney-General. The views of the Government of which I was Attorney-General were that the Family Court judges should be paid salaries commensurate with their status as judges of a superior court, as the Act established the Court to be, and that their salaries should certainly be close to, if not equal to, but in the range of salaries paid to Federal Court judges. The present Government has followed the policy that the salaries of judges, along with those of so many other office holders, should be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. In our view the appropriate body to determine the salaries of Family Court judges is the Remuneration Tribunal and not the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Democrats have not sought an amendment to this Bill which would in any way require the Remuneration Tribunal to determine whether Family Court judges' salaries should be equal to Federal Court judges' salaries or whether they should be a specific percentage of the Federal Court judges' salaries or in any way restrict the discretion of the Remuneration Tribunal. Therefore, the first limb of the amendment we interpret as simply indicating that in the view of the Senate the Remuneration Tribunal ought to determine the salaries of Family Court judges at much the same level as we suggested to the Tribunal on several occasions when we were in government. I do not know whether the present Government has put forward views on this question to the Remuneration Tribunal. I hope the Minister at the table, Senator Tate, who is unfortunately engaged in a conversation with somebody else at the moment, will be able to tell us what the Government's attitude has been towards the salaries of Family Court judges when he responds shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis, the Opposition has no difficulty with the sentiment expressed in limb (a) of the Democrats' amendment. The second limb of the Democrats' amendment says that we should be seeing changes, amendments and extensions of jurisdiction of the Family Court contained in this Bill as a process leading to the possible amalgamation of the Family Court and the Federal Court. We are also not opposed to that. However, we think it does need some qualification in the sense that this is only one of the various solutions to the future of the Family Court. The Opposition has not determined any definite position at this stage about the future of the Family Court. I expressed the view when I spoke during the second reading debate that this option was the most practical solution for the Family Court in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are other options which I understand the Government has already pursued and may well want to keep open for the future. The Opposition would like to keep open some other options. In particular, we would want to keep open the option of the creation of State family courts in each State, along the lines of the Western Australian State Family Court. I made brief reference to this at the end of my speech earlier today. I ran out of time and so did not sufficiently develop that option-and I do not propose to develop it at any great length now-but in view of the fact that the Australian Democrats have raised this question of the future of the Family Court in this specific way, rather than just commenting on it during the course of a speech I think it is desirable for me to outline this other option. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, when the Family Court proposal was first canvassed, the then Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs considered the original Family Law Bill. I think Senator Reid read from Senator Murphy's original speech introducing that Bill. He pointed out that that original Bill did not contain a proposal for a Family Court. That idea was being developed at that stage by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, which had been given a reference on the initiative of Senator Murphy. It had been moving towards the idea of recommending a Family Court. When it reported on Senator Murphy's Bill it recommended that a Family Court should be established. My recollection is that that report also recommended-although it may have been raised in a later debate; I am not quite sure-that the Family Law Act, in establishing a Family Court of Australia, should give States the option of establishing State family courts. That was certainly a view which I strongly supported. Senator Chaney reminded me this morning when I was speaking in the debate that it was very much an initiative put forward by the Opposition. The end result was that the Family Law Act enabled these arrangements to be made if the States wished to take them up. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the attitudes that State governments and parliaments were taking to the growing centralism of those days, I thought that they would be anxious to take up that option that the Parliament was giving them. It was a most desirable option from the point of view of more efficient administration. It is far more efficient to have courts administered at the State level than at the Federal level. It largely overcame the jurisdictional conflicts in the Federal system relating to family law. Those jurisdictional conflicts, of course, have emerged in an unfortunate way over the last 12 years of the life of the Family Court. Hopefully, they have now been largely resolved by the reference of power by some States and the cross-vesting proposals that this Parliament passed last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly the establishment of State family courts, which are able to be invested with the full Federal and State jurisdiction in relation to various matters, such as ex-nuptial children, adoptions and the maintenance of a testator's family. There are a range of matters which impinge on the family which are not necessarily covered entirely by the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament and are certainly not covered by the Family Law Act, and by and large cannot be as the High Court has unfortunately held on a number of occasions over the last 12 years. It would have been far better if the States had taken up this option. We could still have had a national court of appeal in family law-a small expert court. I think it would have greatly assisted in establishing the prestige and standing of the Court if the Federal element of it had been of that kind, in the same way as the Federal Court has rapidly established that reputation. Although it has grown a lot in recent times, it was established as a small and expert court. It was able to establish its reputation in the community very quickly. I think that would have provided a far more efficient administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems that beset the Family Court would have been more easily solved at the State level if States other than Western Australia had taken up that option. I think the experience of the Western Australian State Family Court proves the point, because all commentators, in my experience, have praised the efficiency, standing and competence of the Western Australian State Family Court. As I said, it has been able to be invested with the full Federal jurisdiction as well as the State jurisdiction. I still hope that the States see the wisdom of proceeding in that way. Certainly there was some interest in doing that from at least one State. It may be worth while attempting to persuade others of the wisdom of that course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is prepared to support the second limb. Certainly, if the State family Court option does not succeed, it seems to me almost inevitable that the Family Court will be amalgamated in some way or other with the Federal Court in due course. I still want to be assured that this is workable. As I said earlier, I believe this Bill is an experiment and we should see how it works. I hope that the Government takes the same attitude to it. I would like to hear Senator Tate's view on that. Certainly we do not want to close off the option in the way in which the Democrats amendment may suggest. We acknowledge that it is a possible and very likely option, but we do not want to close off other options. Therefore, although we support the Democrats amendment, we do so with the reservations and qualifications which I have indicated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this most important Bill, the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill 1987. In doing so I say that I believe we are dealing with a jurisdiction which obviously is very burdensome to those who undertake judicial office and who discharge the responsibilities conferred on them by the statutes of this Parliament in regard to family law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become apparent, as has been mentioned by many of the contributors to the second reading debate, that the scope of the work which is entrusted to judges of the Family Court of Australia is perhaps not as challenging and as extensive as their judicial office should allow and that, given the talent of the personnel that one wants to attract to the jurisdiction of the Family Court, their talents could be well used also in dealing with other matters within the Federal jurisdiction. So the narrowness of jurisdiction which has characterised the ambit of the work of the Family Court judges is, by this Bill, to be extended but in a way which, it has to be emphasised, will be done in consultation with the Chief Judge of the Family Court and the Federal Court. Those consultations will, of course, make it happen that only those judges within the Family Court system who may be appropriately versed in law, such that they can deal with income tax appeals, consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act, some Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act matters, bankruptcy and so on, do actually deal with them. So I am sure that this particular addition of Federal jurisdiction to some of the judges of the Family Court will be most welcome and indeed, as I understand it, the chamber is supporting that particular proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also intended to allow the Family Court judges to concentrate on the more complex, difficult and contentious matters that come before them. In that regard the delegation of certain jurisdictions and powers to judicial registrars is, I think, to be welcomed. In so far as we have experience of some similar office-that of masters of Supreme Courts-I think we have a model which is well understood, and I believe it will work very well in this instance. It will leave the judges freer to concentrate, as I said, on the more important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the most contentious area of this legislation is the proposal to give jurisdiction to courts of summary jurisdiction in respect of undefended applications for dissolution where the parties, for their own convenience, request the application to be dealt with in such courts. We have an amendment which allows them to file direct in such courts of summary jurisdiction. That has, of course, caused some debate in the community and we have listened to that debate. With the benefit of the summer break, more of that discussion took place and was taken into account. But in the end the Government does not believe that the assumption of that jurisdiction at the request of the parties will trivialise the institution of marriage, as is sometimes asserted. The trauma and real hurt of the decision to separate initially is where the great drama of divorce, if you like, takes place. It has to be recalled that this legal act of recognition of that traumatic and dramatic event when the parties separated occurs at least 12 months later, and it is this legal recognition of that dramatic event which we are talking about in relation to divorce. If the parties themselves request that it be dealt with in this particular jurisdiction, I think that ought to be permitted. </PARA>

As I say, the actual traumatic separation of the parties and the need therefore to decide on custody applications and so on will have occurred very probably in the 12 months preceding the actual divorce matter itself. If the matter comes before a magistrate and, as Senator Walters quite rightly pointed out in her second reading contribution, the custody of children is at stake and the magistrate has to exercise a jurisdiction there, he exercises that jurisdiction in exactly the same way as a Family Court judge does now. He gets all the same papers and all the same information in order to make any decision that is required at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> It is also intended that in relation to property matters the monetary limit on the jurisdiction of those courts of summary jurisdiction be increased but not in the way that was originally proposed in the Bill. It is true that over the summer months there has been time for reflection and consideration of submissions, including those from the Law Institute of Victoria, which was against the transfer of this jurisdiction to Magistrates Courts in any case, but pointed out quite soundly that the monetary limit in property matters should not vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Recognising that, the Government proposes that the upper limit be changed to some $20,000, and that seems to be a uniform and sensible amount of money which will cover most cases of furnishings and perhaps a car and so on-the property matters. We also make it very clear that the way of assessing the $20,000 is done by looking at the gross value of the property, disregarding any mortgage, lien, charge or other security over the property. I think that could work very well, and I commend to honourable senators that particular change in the Bill before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to property matters, yes, I think that is a fair way to approach the matter.

<PARA>The Government supported applications by Family Court judges to the Remuneration Tribunal and, of course, the Family Court judges have been pressing for that greater approximation to the salaries of Federal Court judges, but to date those submissions have not found favour with the Tribunal.

<PARA> I think the amendment is properly worded. I think in one early draft it said something like it should equal those of Federal Court judges. On discussion that was thought to be too firm in its expression of the Senate's opinion, and I believe it is much more usefully worded now. The second part of the amendment moved by Senator Macklin to the second reading motion was:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the passage of this bill should be seen as just one step in a process leading to the possible amalgamation of the Family and Federal Courts.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Durack has quite rightly pointed to the fact that the amalgamation of the Federal and Family Courts is a long way off, if it is to happen at all, and may not even be-certainly if reports of the Western Australian experience are to be believed-the most desirable course. There is no doubt that the Western Australian Family Court has been eminently successful in its exercise of jurisdiction. Mr Justice Barblett is the Chief Judge in that Court.

The Government has also made submissions to the Judicial Committee of the Constitutional Commission which, in its discussion paper, originally spoke of amalgamation of the Family and Federal Courts. The Government took the opportunity to outline the proposals which have now found expression in this Bill. As I understand it, the Committee of the Commission on that basis did not proceed with its earlier recommendation about amalgamation. It recognised that this was, as the second reading amendment now speaks of it, just a step which could lead to possible amalgamation.

As to the difference between general and particular matters, whilst some general principles will emerge in those discussions about the types of cases generally that may be transferred, I am advised that there may be instances on which a transfer agreement could be reached, such as on a more complex tax matter that normally would not fall within the general range of those matters which it had been agreed could usefully be transferred to Family Court judges. Such a situation could arise in Townsville where there is only a Family Court judge. Even though such cases would fall outside of the general policy developed, in those particular instances an agreement to transfer the matter would be reached. As to whether the consultations will lead to certain guidelines being reduced to writing, I would be astonished if that were not the case. I do not think that they will have the formal status of rules of court, but I would be astonished if they were not made public and therefore available for scrutiny and the enlightenment of legal advisers and the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from the Minister's answer that he does not really know at this stage whether any guidelines have been brought into existence; perhaps none have been. It seems rather strange that the Minister cannot tell us whether such an important feature of this Bill has been finalised, or when it will be finalised. Perhaps he could find that out, if not tonight at least for when we resume debate on this Bill, which I understand will not be until next week. I found the answer that he was able to give unsatisfactory. Clearly there can be consultation on specific cases. I understand the instance that he mentioned. Because of the inability of the Federal Court to deal with a particular case, even though it may be a very complex case, the parties may be happy for it to be referred to the Family Court even though it would otherwise not be sent there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the Minister, he did not really make it clear what type of case, say, in the area of tax or trade practices, would be transferred to the Family Court. By way of example, there is enormous variation in the complexity of work covered under the Trade Practices Act. However, one can draw a broad distinction between part IV of the Act, which deals with traditional restrictive trade practices matters, and part V, which deals with misleading statements and which is generally referred to as the consumer protection side of the Act. Under part V, many very simple cases of fact can arise; very few or no legal questions arise. Is there to be some distinction of that kind?</PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that there have been lots of discussions about this Bill and about different options, and that this is the one that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) ultimately came up with after considering others. The matter has certainly involved discussion over a great deal of time. I would have thought that by this stage we could have some more specific indication from the Minister of what sorts of cases the chief judges of the courts are likely to transfer and what tests will be applied for the transfer of such cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that Chief Judge Bowen and the new Chief Judge of the Family Court of Australia, Mr Justice Nicholson, will, as I understand it, carry out those consultations. The new Chief Judge of the Family Court has only just been appointed. The fact is that these judges will consult and will come to some understanding and agreement on those matters which may be transferred. I do not think it would be a static situation; it would be somewhat ambulatory. As the tentative nature of the transfer becomes more accepted, those guidelines will change. But it will all depend on the consultation between, and the good sense of, the Chief Judge and the Chief Judge of the Family Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the Trade Practices Act, which Senator Durack raised specifically, the jurisdiction that may be transferred would relate only to part V, the consumer protection provisions. Indeed, if in defence of a part V prosecution a part IV issue arises, the Federal Court would be the proper forum; that is made clear in the Bill. There are already some guidelines in the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate is developing some expertise in being able to read out what is on the record. This information was made available to honourable senators at only 10 o'clock this morning and most honourable senators have been dealing with the debate in the Senate since then and have been trying to deal with the problems the Government has presented to the chamber. I do not know why the Opposition bothers to try to assist the Government; it only tries to assist it but one would think, from the attitude of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), that the Opposition is trying to impede consideration of this matter tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Tate is aware of the structure of the Family Court around Australia but hitherto there have been a number of registries. The administration of the Court has been divided up throughout Australia with various registries. In the Minister's State there is a registry in Hobart and one in Launceston. There must be one in both the north and the south of Tasmania. South Australia does not make the same demands; it has only one registry in Adelaide. There are two registries in Queensland; one in Townsville, and one in Brisbane. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of the Court in these registries has been the responsibility, subject to the Chief Judge, of the senior judge of the Court. As I understand it now these roles will be performed by a judge specifically appointed for that task as a judge administrator. I should like to know whether I am right. I do not altogether abstract those views from the written record, even if I had had time to read it today. Can the Minister say whether a judge administrator will be appointed in each registry rather than leaving it to the Chief Judge or sole judge in the registry?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 9 inserts proposed new sections 26a and 26b. Proposed new section 26b (6) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Judicial Registrars shall have, in addition to the powers delegated to them under subsection (1), such other powers (if any) as are conferred on them by this Act, the regulations and the Rules of Court. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that the proposed new section does not say `or the Rules of Court' but I wonder why those words are there because either the powers are conferred by the Act on the judicial registrars or they are not. If they are conferred on them by the Act, presumably regulations are then made to delineate those powers. The amendment then says `and the Rules of Court'. I am not sure why those words are necessary in there. The reason I raise this matter is that I believe certain functions should be the preserve of the judges. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern that I have expressed on a number of occasions in this chamber is that not enough emphasis is given to reconciliation counselling and to advice to the marriage partners when they come before the Court or make enquiries of court officials on this important aspect of reconciliation counselling. I refer honourable senators to section 14 (3) of the Family Law Act where it makes it perfectly clear that reconciliation counselling should form a very important part of this whole system. Unfortunately, as everyone in the chamber knows, very little attention is given to the question of reconciliation counselling by court officers or the judges of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large, almost all of the counselling done in the Family Court is divorce counselling. That is not the spirit of the legislation. I said in my speech in the second reading debate that it is difficult to blame the judges of the Court for the administration of what is essentially an unjust law. Of course, many people regard this law as unjust because it deals with separation in a manner that makes no distinction concerning the conduct of the particular party who may have caused the separation. Of course that leaves a great sense of frustration and injustice on the part of the person affected-for example, a woman who may have children and whose husband has just up and left her, but a year later bobs up and wants a divorce. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that it is important that we know what the judicial registrars are. I think it is important for the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to give us an indication of the Government's view of reconciliation counselling, and there is a need for court officers and judges to remember the emphasis given by those who rise in debate in this chamber and in the other place to reconciliation counselling. Therefore, I would like the Minister to let the chamber know what he envisages are to be the functions of the judicial registrars and why clause 26B (6) is in the Bill at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 26B (6), which deals with the powers of judicial registrars, refers to such powers conferred on them by the Act, the regulations and the rules of court. I think that that clause is just a simple recognition of that fact. As Senator Harradine said, the regulations must be made in order to carry out the provisions of the Act. That is fairly clear. Section 123 of the principal Act provides for the making of rules of court. Of course, they deal with the practice and procedures to be followed in the Family Court. Almost the whole alphabet is set out under section 123 (1), concerning the making of the rules of court. There is a recognition in clause 26B (6) that the powers that may be conferred on the judicial registrars simply can be either directly imposed or granted by the statute itself, or can be conferred by the regulations made under the statute and by a majority of the judges making rules of court for the practice and procedures of the Court. I think it is fairly straightforward in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of reconciliation counselling, it is true, and ought to be emphasised more often, that under section 14 of the Family Law Act it is the duty of the judge to give consideration from time to time to the possibility of the reconciliation of the parties. It is known that there are instances of course in which a judge will, having come to some assessment of the parties, make an observation or a suggestion to that effect. However, I think it would be only realistic to acknowledge that by the time the parties get before the judge in a contested matter, it is extremely unlikely that the invitation to consider the possibility of reconciliation will be taken up. It is important therefore that as early as possible in the approach of the parties to the Court they be made aware of marriage counselling organisations. Senator Harradine quite rightly in his speech on the second reading debate pointed to the importance of the role of marriage guidance and counselling organisations which obviously will more commonly have a role which is, on the approach of the parties, more likely to result in the reconciliation of them than will be the conciliation counselling processes undertaken within the Family Court structure where the parties have already come to with a view to gaining legal recognition of their separation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst reconciliation counselling obviously requires much more emphasis in the community-I am assured that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has a very real interest in strengthening those reconciliation counselling organisations-it must be an important consideration in the overall pattern of the Family Law Act and, indeed, in relation to the whole question of families in Australia. However, insofar as powers of judicial registrars are concerned, I do not think I can say any more in regard to the structure of clause 26 (b). I now move Government amendment No. (5), as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Page 3, clause 9, at the end of proposed section 26c add the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `(3) The Court may, on the application of a party or of its own motion, refer an application under subsection (1) to a Full Court of the Court.'.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have already heard in this discussion, clause 9 proposes to establish the new office of judicial registrar. Clause 9 is an extensive clause which, of course, sets out all the matters required to be done in establishing such an office. It sets out the powers, the qualifications for appointment, the terms of office, remuneration, termination provisions and so on. As is evident from Senator Harradine's questions, the powers that may be exercised by judicial registrars potentially are quite as extensive as the powers that may be exercised by judges in the Family Court of Australia. We know, of course, that rules of court have to be made. I suppose that we will not know exactly what they are until they are made. However, I assume that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has some views about the role the position of judicial registrar is being created for. I must say that I am now somewhat bemused at the totality of the amendments and why, indeed, there is a proposal for the establishment of judicial registrars at all. I ask these questions because there has been a steady progression in the powers granted to registrars of the Court. I have to refer to the next clause, clause 12, which widens even further the powers of registrars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last of the amendments which relate to registrars was made, I think, in 1985. Section 37a of the Family Law Act provides that judges may make rules of court delegating to registrars all or any of the powers of the Court. Then, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the Act sets out matters that may be exercised by registrars. The only limit that was then placed upon registrars was under subsection 2, that they could not be delegated the power to make decrees for dissolution, annulment of marriage, declarations as to the validity of marriage or orders approving maintenance agreements under section 87. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 12, to which I have already referred, that one and only limit on the powers of registrars is to be removed by the Family Court of Australia (Additional Jurisdiction and Exercise of Powers) Bill. The Opposition is not opposing that matter. But in view of the development of the role of the registrar in practice and in view of the development and the recognition of the very important work the registrars perform-particularly in the compulsory conferences in property disputes, all the other sundry work of the Court that is done by registrars which is detailed in section 37a and now the further power to be able to deal with principal relief which they will have after this legislation is passed-I find that I do not quite understand why the Government has decided to create the new office of judicial registrar at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in the second reading debate and I will say it again that the Opposition supports greater powers of delegation to officials of the Court to relieve judges of as much of the routine type of work as possible and to enable the judges to deal with the difficult contested cases of custody and property. Unless I misunderstood or overlooked something, it would seem to me that all those powers will be able to be exercised by the registrars themselves who indeed have a status, as far as their salary is concerned, equivalent to at least junior magistrates in New South Wales. I suppose that the salary scales are much the same around Australia. I would like some clarification why a new office of judicial registrar is being established at all in light of the matters that I have mentioned regarding the registrar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why the title is `judicial registrar' is that these registrars are to be distinguished from the present registrars whose domain, obviously, is mainly to do with administration. The idea with the judicial registrar is that he or she will be exercising more clearly traditional judicial powers. For example, they will be able to deal with contested cases probably in minor property and custody matters, with the consent of the parties. But the fact is that, once again, I think we are dependent on the sense of the judges who make the rules of court which will confer this particular range of matters on the judicial registrar. Clause 26b (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I agree it is perhaps unsatisfactory at the moment not to have those rules of court already before us, but I would have thought that one could be reasonably certain that there will be a proper and circumspect delegation of those powers of the Court.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) presumably is revealing a total poverty of thought on the part of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). I am not suggesting that Senator Tate is responsible for this. This idea seems to have been dreamt up by the Attorney-General himself who explained in a general sort of way what the idea of the judicial registrar was. I accepted this at its face value until I looked a little more closely into other amendments in this legislation. Senator Tate has fallen back in answering me on to clause 26b (1) of the Bill, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Judges, or a majority of them, may make Rules of Court delegating to the Judicial Registrars all or any of the powers of the Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that means that they can deal with contested cases as well as administration, conferences or whatever and they can deal with dissolution as well as custody and everything else. That is what it means they can do. But I have already referred the Minister, Senator Tate, to a recent amendment of the Family Law Act. In fact, amendment No. 193 of 1985 inserted a new section 37a into the Family Law Act. Section 37a states that the Judges, or a majority of them, may, subject to sub-section (2) make rules of court delegating to the Registrars all or any of the powers of the Court. That is exactly the same wording as contained in this Bill as far as judicial registrars are concerned. Surely the simple wording of these two provisions must be apparent to Senator Tate who is not without some legal ability? The very same wording is used in relation to the powers of judicial registrars as now applies to the potential powers of registrars. In addition to section 37a clause 12 of this Bill removes the one limit on the powers of registrars that has existed, namely, they cannot deal with principal relief because that is removed by clause 12 which we will be dealing with shortly. I am bemused as to why we have an office of judicial registrar when the Government has seen fit to expand greatly the powers of registrars. What is the point of it? Registrars can now be given the power to deal with contested proceedings and, indeed, will be able to deal with contested claims of principal relief after we pass this legislation. Therefore, I really do believe that the Government has some better explanation of why it is complicating this whole question by creating a new office of judicial registrar. I believe that the Senate is entitled to be told why the Government is creating this office in light of other amendments it has made in relation to the registrars themselves. </PARA>

This is a matter that people might think is not of much consequence, and they might wonder whether I am actually arguing with Launceston; I assure honourable senators that I am not. What I am saying, though, is that the Government has shown that it has absolutely no regard for the national capital and what it stands for. It has absolutely no regard for the need to diversify and change the economic face of Canberra and develop our educational expertise; and it has no regard for the confidence that it takes away from the business community when it treats Canberra in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go back to remind the Senate that the Public Works Committee went into extensive inquiries last year to determine whereabouts the Aviation College should be placed. The Aviation College has been in Melbourne for a long time, but the Department of Aviation moved to Canberra some time ago and found it was then very costly to run the college in Melbourne and determined that it ought to shift it to the national capital. There were a number of sites in contention and finally the Public Works Committee decided that the cheapest and most efficient place to put it was at Watson High School, which was to close at the end of 1987, and which would enable the college to be functioning by 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time after that, for what reason we do not know, somebody decided that to try to get the college down to Launceston would be of some advantage. We are not quite sure who that was, but we have a fair idea. Launceston may need something. That is the only explanation we have been given from the Prime Minister since then: that Launceston needed something. I shall return to that.</PARA>
<PARA> It was in November, 1987, that I heard that this back-door wheeling and dealing was going on. I asked a question of the Minister and he prevaricated a bit and then subsequently gave an answer confirming that this was going on; that there was talk-notwithstanding the fact that moneys had been expended in Canberra to get it set up here-that there was some sort of deal was being done to shift it away from Canberra. A week or so ago we got the announcement from the Prime Minister that that was the case and that it would go to Launceston. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, my quarrel is not with that city; it is entitled to be on the march trying to get something, having been done out of cycling, which was sold off from the Institute of Sport a while ago and given to Adelaide. The fact is that Launceston has one of the best velodromes that one will find anywhere, especially in this country. Adelaide does not have a velodrome anything like the standard. I do not agree with the wheeling and dealing that has gone on with sport from the Institute of Sport. In 1984 hockey was given to Perth; in 1985 squash and diving went to Brisbane; and in 1987 cycling and cricket went to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of having an Institute of Sport that the country could be proud of, centrally based in the national capital-where it ought to be so that all elite sports people and those who would benefit from the training they would get from the institute would come to one place and have the benefit of mixing with other athletes and the benefit of being with that splendid sports medicine facility-this Government has embarked on a course of splintering it and having little bits and pieces here and there, where it thinks it will be of some advantage to itself. For some reason that is inexplicable, cycling went to Adelaide and not to Launceston, and everybody knows that Tasmania is the place where cycling has been a sport of very high priority. They have had many champions and, as I said, they have the velodrome that ought to have attracted cycling if it was to be taken away from where it ought to have been. We face the situation of the same people then trying to make it up to Launceston by giving them something down there, by taking the Aviation College away from the national capital and giving it to Launceston. It will be a great deal more costly for it to be based down there, and the taxpayers, either State or Federal, will have to bear the cost of that being the case. </PARA>
<PARA> My point is that this shows that the Government treats the national capital with contempt; it shows that it treats the local business entrepreneurs, who are doing their best to bring industry and business to Canberra, with contempt; and it has no regard for trying to develop our economy in a way which will give greater opportunities for young people to get employment here so that we can have an education system that is as broad as is possible and attract people to Canberra in that respect. It is a great shame that this Government bears, having taken this institution from Canberra, having demonstrated to my constituents that anything that is here is up for grabs if somebody else can make a better offer for it. It is a shame. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra Times wrote a very good editorial on the matter last Saturday and for those who have not read it, I recommend that they do so. The only criticism I would have of that editorial is that it did not bother to point out that there was no reaction from the Labor members in the Australian Capital Territory to this decision. One would have thought there would have been an outcry from them for having embarked on this course; but that was not the case. I believe they, too, bear part of the shame of having let down this electorate and the people of Canberra in allowing the Aviation College to be taken away for some cheap political purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Sunday a memorial service was held in the Wesley Hall, Lonsdale Street, Melbourne for Ted Hill-Edward Fowley Hill. Many people attended: judges past and present, union leaders, academics, surgeons, politicians, public servants, and people who lead and have led great movements. The number of those who attended together with the width of beliefs they represented gave grand testimony to Ted Hill. They made manifest the extraordinary range of his friends and admirers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A great number of progressive people were attracted to Ted. This is unremarkable. More remarkable is the great number of those of conservative bent who called him friend. On Tuesday, 2 February 1988, the Sydney Morning Herald headlined its report of Ted Hill's passing with the words, `Leading Communist lawyer dies after illness of 15 years'. This is an accurate though inadequate description of what he was. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted Hill was born in 1915 and died on 1 February 1988. He lived more than three score years and ten, and they were filled with great achievements. He was indeed a communist, as the Sydney Morning Herald noted. He adhered faithfully to his beliefs over many years. He was a leading member of the Marxist-Leninist Party at the time of his death. Many who did not share his philosophy admired his willingness to place it ahead of professional self-interest. His career suffered markedly as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1950s, Ted Hill appeared in the Royal Commission into Communism and in the Petrov case. The decade was a crucial one for civil liberties. Ted's advocacy for a cause, subject to fierce hostility from the great and the powerful, vindicated the right to dissent. He promoted the right of free speech by exercising it when most feared to do so. Ted Hill believed in the power of intellectual persuasion. He believed an argument, properly put, will be effective even with those at first thought implacable to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted lived his life on the basis that its various dimensions were integrated. He was a brilliant lawyer and put many a technical argument with great strength and skill. He was a powerful political theoretician. He had a deep concern with social dynamics, but he saw that significant change in Australia was not based on any one of these alone. Legal argument, infused with social and political beliefs and transformed by a grand vision, can do much. On its own it makes for stagnation. Passionate political and social principles on their own do not provide the machinery to effect that change. </PARA>
<PARA> His approach to legal work is compelling evidence of this. Ted Hill demonstrated his ability to combine high legal skill with passionately held political and social beliefs. He combined amazing medical knowledge with superb legal skills to develop a process of advocacy which he and many others used to win compensation for heart attack victims at the Workers Compensation Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Ted comprehended and took part in great historic movements. He was friends with a wide range of public figures in Australia. He was welcomed to China by its leadership in the 1950s and 1960s when very few Westerners visited that country. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, he was a man dedicated to the individual in distress. His approach to injured workers is compelling evidence of this. A proposition that in Victoria he has helped more injured workers in economic and social distress than has anyone else is unlikely to bring a rebuttal. Ted had great intellectual capacity, great dedication to his beliefs, great energy, great empathy with those in need and great willingness to help them. I express my condolences to Ted's wife and children. Ted Hill has left a society much richer for his life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that I was not in the chamber for all of Senator Margaret Reid's address but I did come into the chamber to relieve Senator Tate, who was then the duty Minister, when Senator Reid was concluding with the words, as I took them down, `the aviation college to be taken away from Canberra for a cheap political purpose'. I regret that I did not hear the whole of Senator Reid's speech. I will read it in Hansard to see whether it is necessary for the Government side to reply to the views that she has put or to answer any of the questions she may have raised in that address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cooney gave a valedictory address about Ted Hill, who I think is well known in the labour movement as being a communist. He is well known as the leader, I think, of the Communist Party, Marxist-Leninist and someone with whom I think I would not have any commonality of view on almost any point. But I recognise the great sincerity with which Senator Cooney paid a tribute to the passing of this participant in the wider tapestry of the labour movement and know that Ted Hill certainly did contribute a great deal on the legal side of workers compensation in his role as a Victorian workers compensation lawyer. I acknowledge the remarks that Senator Cooney has made. </PARA>
