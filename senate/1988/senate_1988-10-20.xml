<PARA>The petition of the undersigned respectfully brings to your attention:</PARA>
<PARA>that there are individuals who have a conscientious objection to war because of their religious or general moral principles</PARA>
<PARA>and that the Parliament of this country has already recognised the right of such individuals not to have to participate in military service in time of war</PARA>
<PARA>and that all Australian taxpayers are required to contribute to military expenditure, regardless of their beliefs, through that part of their tax that is used for the Defence budget</PARA>
<PARA>and that while we acknowledge the right of the Government to levy taxes and to decide on the expenditure of monies so collected we cannot accept that those with a conscientious objection to war should be forced to contribute to military expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA>that the Federal Government will acknowledge the right of those who have a conscientious objection to war to withhold their taxes from military allocations and enable the military related proportion of their taxes to be used for peaceful purposes only</PARA>
<PARA>and, as we note that taxes are collected or disbursed for specific purposes (such as for Medicare), that the Commissioner of Taxation be directed that the military-related proportion of taxes collected from conscientious objectors to war be set aside in a separate fund, the Peace Tax Fund, to be used only for peaceful purposes, such purposes to be determined by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator J. Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA>c/- The Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> I write to ask for your support regarding the announcement in the Budget that eligibility for Allowances for Isolated Children and Austudy Allowances would be subject to Asset Testing.</PARA>
<PARA> Geographically isolated students are already a disadvantaged group and Asset Testing of Additional Allowances under the A.I.C. scheme (Assistance for Isolated Children) and Austudy Allowances will further disadvantage our children.</PARA>
<PARA> Isolated families have no option-our children must board away from home to gain access to education and the cost of this is continually increasing, while the basic A.I.C. allowance of $989 has not increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Many rural properties would have an asset value over the $300,000 limit (even after the 50 per cent reduction on the income earning portion of the asset), yet have little or no income due to matters beyond our control, such as drought, floods or low prices for our produce.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister Mr Hawke calls for the retention of students at school and onto higher education. The Asset Test on educational allowances will undoubtedly lead to some rural children leaving school at an earlier age and many academically able rural children will be denied the opportunity to go on to Higher Education.</PARA>
<PARA> All Australian children should have the right to have access to a full education, Asset Testing will deny many country children this right.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask you to please consider the points I have raised when the Budget is debated in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>PUBLIC SERVICE DETERMINATION NO. 159 OF 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Determination provided for the payment of early retirement benefits to certain Civil Aviation Authority officers. The Committee's concern related to an apparent discretion given to the Chief Executive Officer in relation to the early retirement of officers and the implied notion that the Determination would be subject to a sunset clause. The Acting Public Service Commissioner, Mr Holdich, advised the Committee on the practical operation of the Determination and that this position was reached after staff consultation and acceptance of the scheme. He further indicated that the operation of the Determination would be under continual review and that the need for a sunset clause was obviated. The Committee in considering the background to this Determination, accepted the advice provided. </PARA>

The Committee's concerns related to the provision of adequate appeal rights for seamen who received an adverse decision from the Marine Council. The Regulations did not appear to include these important rights. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, the Hon. Bob Brown, M.P., indicated that appeal rights were provided under section 424aa of the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Taylor,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered Public Service Determination No. 159 of 1988, tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee draws to your attention two issues that are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, clause 5.1 (2) gives the Chief Executive Officer a discretion to withhold the early cessation payment:</PARA>
<PARA>``. . . if the Chief Executive Officer is satisfied, having regard only to the operational requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority relating to air traffic control or flight service that the retirement of the officer is not in the interests of the Service''. </PARA>
<PARA> This discretion does not appear to have any criteria which the Chief Executive Officer can use as a basis for making an informed decision as to who may be granted retirement. This lack of criteria may lead to discrimination against an efficient officer as opposed to another officer who may not be as efficient. On what grounds would the Chief Executive Officer make his decision?</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is also concerned that a person who may not be granted early retirement does not appear to have any recognised avenues of review available. The Committee would appreciate your advice in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the Explanatory Statement, the explanation to clause 5 includes the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>``It is envisaged that it (the retirement scheme) will be reviewed after the scheme has been in operation for 3 years''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, while acknowledging the purpose of that statement is concerned that it appears only within the Explanatory Statement, with no reference to the review of the scheme mentioned in the actual Determination. The Committee seeks your assurance that such a review will indeed take place and queries whether it would have been better to insert the necessary provision within the Determination rather than placing an indication of the Department's intention within the Explanatory Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Your assistance with these matters would be appreciated by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Your sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on</PARA>
<PARA> Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> On 30 August 1988, you wrote to the Department of Industrial Relations about the Committee's consideration of Public Service Determination No. 159 of 1988. In view of the Public Service Commissioner's role in making the Determination, the Department of Industrial Relations has agreed that I should reply to your letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Your letter raised a number of concerns which relate to the discretion in the Determination to withhold the early cessation payment which is authorised by the Determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Memorandum for the Determination mentions that the discretion to withhold the payment is included to avoid the problems which might arise if a large number of officers sought to retire at the same time. I think it is important to emphasise here that while the Determination provides a discretion to withhold the early cessation payment it does not remove the right of Flight Service and Air Traffic Control staff to retire with a pension under the Superannuation Act 1976 once they reach the age of 50 years. There could thus be cases where an officer would choose to proceed with early retirement even though that might cause considerable inconvenience for the employer. In such circumstances, it would seem reasonable that the officer not have access to the significant employer-financed benefits available under the early cessation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that in referring to ``the interests of the Service'' clause 5.1.2 of the Determination does not specify any more detailed criteria which the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Authority should follow in deciding whether to withhold the early cessation payment. I would compare this with the situation under the Public Service Act 1922, where there are powers which are expressed to be exercised subject to the ``interests of the Service'' or ``the interests of the efficient administration of the Service''. Examples of this are sections 51 and 76W of the Act. In both cases, the Act does not set out more detailed criteria on which the judgment might be made. Similarly, I note that in response to a letter of 2 June 1987 from the then Chairman of your Committee, Public Service Board Determination 1983/10 was amended to delete references to `public interest' in favour of `in the interests of the Service'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority has developed criteria for identifying those staff who should be given priority for retirement with the early cessation payment authorised by the Determination. The Authority's intention is that priority for retirement will be determined by a points system based on the sum of the age and length of relevant service of the eligible staff. Staff with the highest points, and who wish to retire, would be given priority. With the agreement of the relevant staff organization, the Authority proposes that this system would operate for a transitional period of approximately 3 years. While this points system may appear mechanical, it has the acceptance of staff and provides an objective means of avoiding the severe disruption which would result if all eligible staff were able to take the option of retirement upon introduction of the early cessation scheme. The same points system was used with success to phase-in the early cessation scheme for Air Traffic Control staff which commenced in January 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The Determination does not specify an avenue of review for cases where an officer was not granted the early cessation payment. However, a decision under clause 5.1 (2) of the Determination to withhold the payment could be reviewed through a number of generally available to review mechanisms. The first option would be for the officer to seek review through the grievance provisions contained in Division 3 of Part III of the Public Service Regulations (regulations 82 to 86 inclusive). Under this process, the grievance would be reviewed in the employing agency. In the event that the officer was not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review, he or she could request investigation of the matter by the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The officer could also pursue the matter in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, which would allow the officer to seek a statement of reasons for a decision to withhold the early cessation payment and to seek review of the decision through the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Your final point concerns the reference in clause 5 of the Explanatory Memorandum to a review of the operation of the scheme after a period of 3 years. This review would relate primarily to the discretion in clause 5.1 (2) of the Determination to withhold the early cessation payment. The basis of the 3 year review period is that the Civil Aviation Authority and the relevant staff organization have agreed to work towards a target phase-in period of three years and will be meeting regularly to review progress towards that objective. In effect, then, the review referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum will be commenced as an ongoing exercise well before the scheme has been in operation for three years. Noting this, and that the phasing-in period could well be reduced or extended from the current three year target, we believe that it would, on balance, be preferable not to specify the three year period in the Determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust this information will overcome the concerns which have been identified by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Transport and Communications</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered Navigation (Master and Seamen) Regulations (Amendment), being Statutory Rules 1988 No. 154, and Navigation (Marine Council and Committees of Advice) Regulations (Amendment), being Statutory Rules 1988 No. 155, tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee draws your attention to the following two issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 2 of the Navigation (Master and Seamen) Regulations (Amendment) amends Regulation 8a of the Principal Regulations by altering a reference to a section in the Act in that Regulation. The Committee's concern is that in the Principal Regulations the heading refers to the ``Minimum age for employment at sea'' while the amending Regulations refer to the ``Maximum age for employment at sea''. This alteration could cause confusion as Principal Regulation 8a appears only to deal with minimum age requirements. Your advice on this discrepancy would be welcomed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation (Marine Council and Committee of Advice) Regulations (Amendment) prescribe principles for the purposes of deciding if a person is suitable for employment as a seaman. The Committee is concerned that once the Marine Council has made a decision there appears to be no right of appeal nor review of that decision, either in the Principal Regulations or the Navigation Act 1912, which the seaman can pursue. As an adverse decision can put an end to a seaman's livelihood, the Committee considers that this seems to be a serious gap. The Committee would welcome your assistance in relation to whether review rights should be inserted to protect the rights of seamen who maybe adversely affected by these Regulations. </PARA>

<PARA>On 30 August 1988 you wrote to Senator Evans concerning amendments to Navigation Regulations. I am replying to your letter following my appointment as Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. </PARA>
<PARA> The heading to Regulation 2 of the Navigation (Master and Seamen) Regulations (Amendment) is, as the Committee points out, erroneously shown as ``maximum age for employment at sea''. While regrettable, this error will not affect the meaning of Regulation 8a itself and the heading will be corrected at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also expressed concern that no right of appeal or review is available from a decision of Marine Council. Review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of such a decision is, in fact, available pursuant to section 424aa of the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. It follows the rather dismissive reply he gave to a question from Senator Walters yesterday about the car plan. He seemed to push the question off on the basis that the matter had been reported in the Australian newspaper. I remind the Minister that, when he announced the car plan, he said in a statement on 29 May that there were four central aims to the car plan, two of which were to make it more efficient and to hold down the price of cars. I also refer the Minister to the fact that, since the introduction of the car plan, increases in prices of locally made vehicles have outstripped the consumer price index by a factor of about two to one, and that the price of a standard Ford vehicle, which I understand has the highest level of local content of any locally produced vehicle-that is the vehicle one would assume is least affected by the devaluation that the Minister referred to yesterday-has increased by almost 70 per cent over that same period. I ask the Minister: Does he regard the outcome with respect to car prices in Australia as satisfactory? Does he regard the outcome with regard to efficiency as satisfactory? If the answer is yes to either or both questions, by what measures does he claim that it is satisfactory, since Australian car buyers are still manifesting sticker shock at the very large price increases that have occurred under the Button car plan?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1642" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never regard anything as particularly satisfactory. I regard the situation, firstly, in terms of the efficiency of the motor vehicle industry in Australia, as a vast improvement on what it was. In my answer to Senator Walters yesterday, I referred to the fact that for the first time in a very long time exports of motor vehicles and components from the motor vehicle industry are, I think it is fair to say, at their highest level ever, and have increased rapidly, and will increase a lot further next year. That is something of a test in an industry that is dependent on volume. Certainly in an industry where there is a close relationship between the component sector and the manufacturing sector, the improvement has been in both parts. On whether I regard it as satisfactory or not, of course, I would like it to be better, but I regard it as a considerable improvement on what has happened previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question relates to price. Following the devaluation of the Australian dollar there were increases, as I said yesterday, in the price of imported vehicles and in the price of locally made vehicles, largely because of component content. I think Senator Chaney has refined that question a bit more today by referring to the Ford Falcon as being the car with the highest local content and saying that the effect of the component price increases following the devaluation should be less in a high local content car. That very much depends on the value, not the amount of imported components-their value in terms of total value of the components in the car; whether they are high cost items or not. However, following the devaluation I said publicly that there was probably some profit taking rather than market share motivation in some of the local producers and that was disappointing.</PARA>

With new models on the road, such as the new Commodore and the new Falcon, the market will be more competitive. With tariffs lowered, as they have been again, the market will become more competitive and if that does not follow through in price effects by the early 1990s, then I think the companies will lose--</PARA></TALK.START>

The lead times in this industry are very long and that is why the car plan is running over a period of seven years. In the span of the car plan, I think it is fair to say that it is pretty well on track, yes. Since the plan was announced on 29 May 1984 there have been enormous factors which have intervened in terms of the devaluation of the dollar and so on, but in terms of changing the structure of the industry in order to produce more efficiently and in the longer term at lower costs, the answer is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question. I wish to advise the Senate that I am conducting a round of discussions with iron ore companies on trends in the market and their expectations for price and tonnage of iron ore exports for next year. I have talked already to Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd and Robe River Iron Associates. I will be speaking to Goldsworthy Mining Ltd next Monday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The world iron ore industry has been badly squeezed in the past few years with steel demand flat and increased supplies of ore from other countries. Between 1982 and 1988 nominal prices in United States dollars for sales into Japan fell by 29 per cent. That amounted to a reduction of 36 per cent in real Australian dollar terms. Moreover, there has been a price increase only once in the past six years. Those market conditions have hurt all of our producers. The Australian industry has survived because it has adapted effectively to the challenges and constraints it has faced.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to advise the Senate that, on the basis of my discussions with the companies and analysis from my Department, I believe that we have every reason to expect solid increases in the prices we receive for our iron ore next year. Iron ore has always been one of the mainstays of our resources sector. Its position will be enhanced next year by relatively tight supply conditions indicated by reductions in ore stockpiles around the world, by the continuing growth of the world economy, by the particularly strong growth in the international steel industry and, last but not least, by the excellent reputation for security of supply, reliability in shipments and quality of output which the Australian mines have built up.</PARA>
<PARA> That reputation has been built up painstakingly over many years. I pay special tribute to the iron ore unions in the Pilbara which have reduced the level of industrial disputation significantly and which have worked effectively through the consultative mechanisms established in the Western Australian Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council. We cannot now put those gains in jeopardy, especially as we are now in a position to start to reap the rewards of the hard work which we have put in over the years. I therefore urge the iron ore unions to maintain the record they have set in industrial harmony, in improved productivity and in further developing the iron ore industry on which Western Australia and Australia generally have long relied.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore look forward to the coming negotiations in Japan and Europe with optimism and confidence. The negotiations are a matter for the companies concerned. My confidence reflects, in part, the Government's assessment of the skills and experience which the companies will bring to the negotiations. The Government will watch the negotiations closely. We have reserve powers available in regard to the export of iron ore, but I can say now that the Government believes that the companies are likely to effect a negotiated outcome which is satisfactory not only to them but to Australia, to our current account, to our export performance and to the overall health of the Australian economy.</PARA>

Has the Government given consideration to these difficulties and to the proposition put by Mr Lansdown that Australia Post may become a public company so that it could be kept at arm's length from government controls in order to operate efficiently as a business enterprise?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a report of Mr Lansdown's speech-a conspicuously misleading report that appeared in the Canberra Times on Wednesday under the heading `Privatisation ``an option'' '. It was quite apparent from the text of the report, and the subsequent material that I have elicited, that Mr Lansdown was saying nothing of the kind in so far as the privatisation issue was concerned. The reporter was unable to distinguish between corporatisation, the removal of government controls and a greater degree of management flexibility-all those dimensions of the issue-and the question of public ownership as such. I make that clear for the record, lest there be any lingering doubt about it. In his speech Mr Lansdown made a number of remarks suggesting that the Government's policy of freeing up its statutory authorities in general, and Australia Post in particular, was wholly salutary and wholly desirable from the point of view of those government business enterprises, and Australia Post in particular, and that he personally-speaking for himself-wanted to see that process continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not clear, because there is no text of his actual speech-he spoke from notes-precisely how far he did go in this respect, but Mr Lansdown has made it clear in subsequent communications with the Government that he was speaking very much in a personal capacity and was just talking in accordance with the logic of the May reform package, although possibly in one or two respects suggesting there was scope for going further down that path. The Government has a completely open mind on this matter and will certainly listen very seriously to any considered views that are put to it by the chairman of an organisation that has been doing extremely well under his stewardship in recent years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This comes down to three matters. Senator Sheil originally asked me a question to which I could not respond at the time because of the detail. I then responded after Question Time and I think Senator Sheil made a personal explanation yesterday. In regard to the first case of the staff member whose pay was supposedly delayed seven weeks, I am advised that the person commenced employment on 11 July 1988. Senator Sheil informed the Department of Administrative Services of her commencement on 10 August 1988. I am happy to table that letter. Immediately following that letter, the Brisbane office of the Department advised the payroll section to make a payment on 10 August. On 15 August that payment was processed. So as you can see, Mr President, there was only a five-day delay period even though, I might say, it took Senator Sheil a month to inform the Department that the staff member had commenced employment. In my response to the honourable senator's question on this I stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Department made the first salary payment within five days of being notified of her commencement.</PARA>
<PARA>It was not five days after she started work but five days after we were notified. We do not have extrasensory perception in the Department of Administrative Services. We cannot actually start paying people until we are told they are working. Senator Sheil's statement yesterday completely misunderstood and distorted what I said. This is the second time in about four weeks that I have had National Party members not thoroughly reading supplementary answers and then shooting their mouths off.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second part of the question, Senator Sheil asserted that there were still teething problems with the computer system. He puts no current evidence forward. In good faith I have had investigations made. We talked, in October, to the people currently running the system. They inform me in good faith that the system is now running well. That is not to say that there are not disputes. There are always disputes when it comes to travel allowance and salary claims, whether the system is running well or not. But it is no use going back to the teething problems of August and July-I admit, and I put it on the record, that there will be problems with a new computer system-and claiming that I was misleading the Senate on 15 or 16 October when I said that the system was working adequately.</PARA>
<PARA> The third part of Senator Colston's question referred to Senator Sheil's press release. I will quote just part of it, but I am happy to table the lot. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Outside Parliament Senator Sheil described the situation as `incredible'.</PARA>
<PARA> `Fancy a woman having to wait seven weeks to be paid,' he said. `If it happened in the private sector the employer would be arrested.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the second case that Senator Sheil was involved with. On 11 July 1988 the Department of Administrative Services was finally notified that a person had been working for Senator Sheil from 13 April 1987. Sixty-five weeks after the person had started employment that person contacted the Department of Administrative Services. That was the first time we knew that she even existed. The only reason for contacting the Department of Administrative Services was that travel was required. We informed that person, `We cannot give you a travel document unless we know that you are on the payroll'. I must say that it occurred to the Department that it was a little strange that someone who had been appointed 65 weeks before had not been paid and we had not heard one whimper about it.</PARA>
<PARA> The first we heard from Senator Sheil on this matter was, again, on 10 August 1988-70 weeks after he had employed someone. Yet Senator Sheil has had the gall to put out a press release saying that if someone has not been paid seven weeks after commencing employment people should be arrested. What should happen to Senator Sheil? Seventy weeks after he employed someone we were finally told by him that he was employing that person. We now have a claim for something like $25,000 in back pay. He has the gall to say that I have misled this chamber, when I clearly did not. He has the gall to put out a press release saying that if there were a seven-week pay delay in private industry someone would be arrested. Yet Senator Sheil has taken 70 weeks to inform the Department of a person's employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Often, when I was the Minister in charge of this area, if a person's pay was two weeks late people would be trooping around to my office with a noose. Apparently in this case Senator Sheil employed someone who was very well off, who could afford not to be paid for 70 weeks. When we were notified of this matter there was a slight delay in starting the payment for that staff member, because we were a little puzzled. But that has been rectified. Senator Sheil notified us on 10 August and on, I think, 1 September that staff member was paid from 10 August. The rest of the claims will have to be sorted out when Senator Sheil responds to our correspondence on this matter.</PARA>

If the level of interjections is any example, it is very fatigued indeed. Let me return to the subject, because this is one of the most unrecognised syndromes in Australia and indeed in the world. One of the problems for sufferers of it is that because their symptoms are unrecognised there is a tremendous overlay of trauma and the attitude is taken that sufferers are lazy or slothful, that they are always sleeping and never alert. People get dismissed from employment because of that. There is a high suicide rate among the 16,000 sufferers in Australia, and indeed a high suicide rate amongst CFS sufferers generally. From that point of view it is a syndrome that probably needs much more public recognition and understanding, and more attention to what levels and forms of treatment can be given to overcome it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not aware of the study referred to by Senator Haines, but I am absolutely sure that Dr Blewett, the Minister for Community Services and Health, is aware of it.

I am sure it will provide the Senate, indeed the whole Parliament, with some very useful information and suggestions as to the way in which our society can cope with this phenomenon in the future. In the meantime, the Australian Federal Police has been given a specific charter and role to fulfil its function as the premier law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth to concentrate and focus, amongst other things, on the question of drug trafficking in Australia.

For example, in March 1988 two persons were arrested in relation to a conspiracy to import heroin. This was the result of an AFP investigation in Perth which was conducted in cooperation with the Thai Office of the Narcotics Control Board. Further investigations, arranged through the AFP liaison officer, led to Thai authorities recovering approximately two kilograms of heroin. The international cooperative aspects needs to be emphasised. In June this year a joint AFP-Australian Customs Service operation was conducted with the assistance of the New South Wales Water Police. Three vessels were intercepted off Sydney Harbour carrying approximately 3.2 tonnes of cannabis. Ten persons were arrested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could go on and on. I was not going to, but I think I will in the light of Senator Hill's interjection. In July 1988 the Australian Customs Service located approximately one kilogram of cocaine on a United States national at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Subsequent investigations by the AFP resulted in the arrest of three persons. Again, only last month, the AFP seized approximately 5.15 kilograms of heroin in the possession of a Singapore national. The seizure was a result of an investigation conducted with close liaison between the AFP and the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau. Only last weekend the Australian Customs Service found approximately two kilograms of heroin on a Pakistani national at Sydney Airport. The man was handed over to the AFP and he assisted the AFP in a controlled delivery of the drugs which led to the subsequent arrest of a second person. I believe that this is a very important categorisation of some successful seizures.</PARA>

I ask whichever Minister that is whether he or she can confirm that the Prime Minister has told the Australian Bicentennial Authority that it must contribute $950,000 towards the cost of an exhibition of Macedonian antiquities being brought to Australia. Is this the same exhibition which was nearly derailed when the Government insisted that the term `Macedonian' not be used in the title of the exhibition because of the alleged offence that it might give to some ethnic groups in Australia? Is the $950,000 which the ABA has been instructed to give in support of this exhibition to be taken away from a foundation marked for the support of Australian youth which was going to be established by the Authority? Finally, is the Minister aware that the Authority has just refused to provide financial assistance for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra to tour the United States of America and that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra will tour the United States on a sponsorship given by a Japanese computer company? Is the Government prepared to explain why the ABA has been instructed to provide $950,000 towards this exhibition and how much of that is a consequence of the Government's earlier decision to try to derail the exhibition coming to Australia in the first place?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Toomelah report by Justice Einfeld, I am sure, will have shocked many Australians and I suppose the result was to ensure that Federal, State and local government work more effectively together to ensure good conditions for Aboriginal communities. In actual fact, the Office of Local Government and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had already initiated moves to establish an interdepartmental committee to work on the needs of Aboriginal councils and that committee has been in operation now for over 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Childs will be aware that, for the first time, in 1987 a total of 73 Aboriginal councils-42 in the Northern Territory and 31 in Queensland-were entitled to grants under the local government financial assistance grants legislation and the Office of Local Government has sponsored a study by a consultant in Queensland to ensure that those resources are effectively allocated to Aboriginal communities. We want to be sure that Aboriginal communities are getting their rightful share of the financial assistance grants, and the first stage of that was implemented in this year's distribution.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the New South Wales Local Government and Shires Association had indicated its interest and its concern about the way Aboriginal communities on the fringes of country towns were considered and it received a grant from the Office of Local Government to look at improving relations and getting better cooperation and greater sensitivity to the needs of Aboriginal councils in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one of the problems had been that far too many councils assume that other departments are looking after those councils. They are very happy to count Aborigines in regard to population statistics for their local grants commissions, but they are not always as speedy in creating services for those communities. Aborigines, wherever they live, are entitled to full services from their local councils. They are also entitled to additional services that are the responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and a number of other State and Federal departments.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the work that was done by the New South Wales Local Government and Shires Association will go a long way towards ensuring that country councils in New South Wales particularly-and I am hoping that councils in other parts of the country will take note of the report-ensure that there is a better relationship and that councils work very sensitively with their Aboriginal communities. I know that in north Queensland, in my former council of Townsville, we employed an Aboriginal liaison officer to ensure that there was a person within local government who could monitor and maintain contact with Aboriginal people to ensure that they were aware of their rights and entitlements under local government.</PARA>

Has the Minister seen the article in the August 1988 edition of Current Affairs Bulletin by Professor Alan Tyree entitled `Who Pays? The Law and Electronic Funds Transfer', in which the effectiveness of the `Recommended Procedures to Govern the Relationship between the Users and Providers of Electronic Funds Transfer Systems' is questioned? Is the Government satisfied with the operation of the recommended procedures? Does the Government consider it satisfactory that, in cases of disputed transactions between an institution and a cardholder, the burden of proof effectively falls entirely on the cardholder, the party with generally little or no capacity to verify his or her claim? Has the Government considered adopting the system in use in New Zealand to resolve such disputes?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Vanstone for a timely question. The question of electronic funds transfers, the recommended procedures and also the level of implementation of those procedures has been an item on the agenda of this Government for, as Senator Vanstone said, some time now. In fact, one of the first tasks I took on as Minister in this portfolio was to meet with industry and to discuss the whole level of the adequacy of the procedures and their implementation. I did so in the course of the review conducted by the Government and a working group of officials of this Government, which working group is intended to report later this year. In fact, the report is expected by the end of November; if not, the start of December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, even though that working group of officials has been continuing its deliberations and in doing so obviously looking at the degree of compliance, at a recent meeting of State and Federal Ministers held in Melbourne on 29 July this matter was also raised by a number of Ministers, including me. As a consequence of that item on the agenda it was further agreed that State and Federal Ministers would take a keener interest in the particular review going on. Mr Roper, the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs, is also spearheading discussions with industry to ensure that we achieve by the end of this year not only sufficient enforcement of the procedures but also a sufficient level of protection to consumers under the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also discussed the matter with the Trade Practices Commission, with the intention that, together with the Trade Practices Commission, we may at the end of the day be able to achieve a degree of enforcement in respect to a self-regulatory code, a degree of enforcement that will also give added protection to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> So the short answer to Senator Vanstone's question is that not only is the Government aware of the particular problem, but a number of responses have been initiated by me in this portfolio to try to accommodate the particular problem and the whole range of issues involved with it.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone raised two specific items in the course of her general inquiry about this whole area. One was in respect of an article that appeared earlier this month. I have not seen that article, but I am sure that most of the problems pointed out in that article are problems that have been brought home to me. The New Zealand experience is one which I am sure the committee spearheaded by Mr Roper is looking at. I will be meeting very shortly with the New Zealand Minister responsible for consumer affairs and one of the items that I have on my agenda to discuss with her is compliance in this area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Devereux raises is one that has been of concern to governments for some time, not only on a Federal level but also on a State level. In fact, a Victorian committee of inquiry into antisocial toys which was released in June this year, and which committee reported to its Minister in February of this year, advised that there was reasonable evidence to suggest that there were casual links between antisocial toys and psychological harm, particularly to children. So it is an area of concern to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had in place for the last seven to eight months a code of self-regulation with the toy industry. The toys basically covered by this particular code are those toys which are ghoulish in nature and which depict children and other human beings in different states of deformity, injury, mutilation, and so on. They are the toys that I think parents throughout the country have been concerned about in terms of their effect on children. The Government's response, as I said, has been one of self-regulation and, together with the toy industry, we have had a substantial degree of compliance with self-regulation. Over the last seven months we have had 31 instances of breaches of the self-regulatory undertaking given by the toy industry; each of those has been followed up successfully. The Victorian inquiry into this area recommended that we proceed with self-regulation across the whole spectrum of three sorts of toys-war toys, toys of violence and victim toys. As the Senate knows, Senator Devereux asked about the last one-victim toys.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of whether the Government proceeds with a regime of self-regulation, it is fair to say that that regime is very much on trial at the moment. AFCO reported that there had been substantial breaches, particularly in the eastern States, of the self-regulatory code. What the Government has done in response to AFCO's report is on three different levels. We have raised the issue once again with the Australian Toy Association Pty Ltd. It has undertaken to contact all its members, urging on them the need to withdraw these toys from the market. Secondly, the Government has indicated that each complaint of a breach of the code will be followed up, and we are doing so at the moment. Thirdly, we will be contacting all importers of these toys to ensure that they also comply with the code.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, we recognise that there is a problem in this area, and the question of whether we maintain self-regulation or proceed to a tighter enforcement regime ultimately will depend on the effectiveness of self-regulation over the next five months.</PARA>

Can the Minister, therefore, say, firstly, whether Aboriginal and Islander people have ever been consulted about Australia's policy of active immigration? If so, do Aboriginals and Islanders approve or disapprove of this policy? If they have not been consulted, why have they not been, and is it the Government's view that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have no right to a voice on how many more people should come in to occupy their land?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter, in general terms, was kind enough to give me an indication of some of the subject matter here. I was kind enough to get an answer, which I have subsequently lost. But let me go to the three points he raises. As to consultation, the Government set up the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policy headed by Dr Stephen FitzGerald in July 1987. It, of course, went right around Australia and made itself available to hear a variety of points of view. Representatives of the Aboriginal communities in Adelaide, Perth and Darwin addressed that Committee and put views to it. Secondly, of course, Ms Eve Fesl is a member of the Office of the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs, and again is a person who has an expert knowledge in these areas and not only is available to receive those views but also puts those views very forcefully. In general, I have to say that opportunity has been given to representatives of the Aboriginal community to put views on the question of immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter asked: What are their views? I suggest that a variety of views have been received from time to time, some put in more colourful language than others by employees of this Government at the head of department level. However, for the most part there is a recognition that an immigration policy will be a continuing feature into the future and not necessarily opposition to it. Senator Coulter asked whether these representatives and the Aboriginal communities have a right to put views on immigration. They have an absolute right to put those views. We, in our consultation round in September, made ourselves available to talk to any particular group. I must say that on my tour around Australia no group representing the Aboriginal community availed itself of that opportunity. But I think, on the whole, I have made myself available to any group that wants to put a view to me about the FitzGerald report and future immigration policy, and I will continue to leave my door open to those sorts of views.</PARA>

When one looks at what the Government would do to add to the list, as distinct from removing properties from it, the first place one must look at is north Queensland. Honourable senators opposite know a bit about north Queensland. They know nothing about what the people think and they know nothing of its ecology, but at least they do know where it is on the map-at least I think they do.

If ever I were to be overruled by Senator Boswell I could not wake up the next morning and think anything of myself! That would be the ultimate disgrace! Having said that, I know what Senator Puplick has now told us he will do and how the Liberals will go about it. After being confronted by `Sinkers' again-challenging him for the second time-Senator Puplick said that a Liberal coalition government would look at reviewing the restrictions placed on land use in contested nomination areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present to the Senate a further communication from the Aboriginal Development Commission in response to the inquiry which I made following Senator Boswell's question yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In accordance with the procedures laid down by the resolution of the Senate on 25 February 1988, Senator Chaney has written to me raising a matter of privilege. The matter relates to the resolution of the Aboriginal Development Commission which I obtained from the Commission and tabled yesterday in response to the question put to me by Senator Boswell. Under the resolutions of the Senate I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should have precedence of other business, having regard to certain criteria. The criteria refer to the principle that the Senate's power to deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide responsible protection against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct the Senate, its committees and senators, and to the existence of any other remedy.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that I can properly make a determination on this matter until I have given consideration to the additional material forwarded to me by the Aboriginal Development Commission which I have presented to the Senate today. I will therefore report my determination to the Senate on the next day of sitting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on this matter. I can understand your believing that you are unable to report on a letter which I delivered to you just before the Senate began sitting this morning because additional material has been put in your hands in the course of Question Time. I acknowledge the difficulty that you face. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I wrote to you as a matter of urgency this morning and intended to ask you a question on the matter during Question Time, but could not do so because you indicated that you would be making a further statement, is that the issue is one of immediate importance. It is of immediate importance because the Senate Estimates Committee E will be sitting later today and dealing with, amongst other things, the estimates of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). I do not think that any observer of Aboriginal affairs in Australia at present would not believe that the game is being played fairly hard. The very difficult task which has been undertaken by the Government in respect of the total replacement of the existing administrative arrangements with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which will have an elected, controlling element, and a totally new approach to the delivery of services in this extremely complex area which is littered with some successes and many failures, is a matter of very great public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months we have seen the sacking of the bulk of the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission in circumstances where the Commission was clearly resisting the Government's proposals. I remind the Senate that that Commission was put in place in a form which followed an extensive and lengthy process of consultation, about which no doubts were ever raised. That consultation was conducted very much at arms length from the political process. I divorced myself from that direct negotiation and put it in the hands of people with no vested political or other interest and I believe that the structure that was put in place was, at that time anyway, representative of the views of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has now reconstituted the Aboriginal Development Commission with people who, it is my understanding, have moved a motion of no confidence in the Chairman of the Commission under circumstances which are directly relevant to the matter which I raised with you as a matter of privilege today, namely, her appearance before the Senate Committee. Again, Mr President, I do not wish to raise matters where I am not in a position to finally substantiate a view, but I think that the likelihood of pressure being brought to bear on people in this matter is very real indeed. The concern of the Opposition and, I would hope, the concern of all senators would be to ensure that the Senate and its committees, both the Estimates Committee and the Select Committee, have the best possible access to the facts. I do not doubt that there will be disputes about facts and in the end, of course, there will be significant differences of judgment about what to do with whatever facts can be determined. But for what is a most complex and difficult process to be in any way sullied by attempts to suppress information, to prevent people, whether they have an interest or not, from freely putting information and views before instruments of the Senate would be a national scandal. The Opposition is extremely serious in its determination to see that this matter is dealt with in a full and fair way. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to speak on this motion because decisions will be made, no doubt, over the next 24 hours about who appears before the Estimates Committee. It is the clear view of the Opposition that it would be quite inadequate for the Estimates Committee to proceed without the assistance, for example, of Mrs Shirley McPherson and Mr O'Brien and whatever other public servants or ADC representatives are thought by the Government to be able to give factual and clear information to the Committee. So I emphasise to the Senate the serious view that the Opposition takes of the matter that I wrote to you, Mr President, about this morning. If there is any suggestion that any improper pressure is being applied to people, I can assure you that we will greet that with outrage and we will take every parliamentary action which is open to us to ensure that it is stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very hurried and casual conversation with the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) who represents the Government in this place on this matter I think it is fair to say that he said, `Of course we all have a common view', or words to that effect, `that we would want full information to be available'. I say to the Minister that I welcome that sort of response from him. I trust that the Minister would have exactly the same view as the general view which I have expressed in this place and that the Australian Democrats would also have the same view. I do not think anybody in this place would in any way doubt the difficulty of the exercise that is being undertaken by the Government. Many of us might think that there are fatal flaws in it, but we will be able to make a considered legislative judgment only if we have full access to the facts. I make a most serious plea to the whole of the Senate that we should treat this matter in a way which accepts that we have a common purpose in there being no suppression or obscuring of whatever the facts are. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to seek leave to continue my remarks. Perhaps I should, because if I were given leave that would block the Minister and the Australian Democrats from speaking. On the other hand, I do not wish to start a debate. It is not my wish to have a lengthy debate on this matter before the information that eventually will come through the processes of these two committees. But, from my own lengthy experience in Aboriginal affairs, it is an area where some people do play it very hard. I do not think that at the political, bureaucratic or community level anyone would deny that it is often played very hard indeed. In those circumstances there is a heavy onus on the Senate, which is the only real supervising legislative chamber in the Commonwealth-we have a peculiar responsibility-to make sure that in the hard playing which occurs in Aboriginal affairs there is not dirty playing. That is very much the determination of the Opposition at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Chaney has raised some matters for your consideration. It would not be my intention to try in any way to colour, prejudice or influence your consideration of the so-called purported question of privilege which Senator Chaney has raised for your consideration. I think there would be general agreement around this chamber that, as far as committees of this chamber and, indeed, of the other place are concerned, it is extremely important and necessary to the eventual discharge of our duties as the democratically elected representatives of the Australian people that the information, the facts and the necessary appearances take place to enable our committees to form considered judgments on the matters put to them, whether of a general policy kind, such as is being undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, or the Estimates committee which reviews the proposals for expenditure, in this case, in relation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the matter was triggered by a resolution, a copy of which was sent to Mr President after he had been questioned by Senator Boswell yesterday. He tabled that resolution just before the adjournment debate late last night. Since that time, Mr President has received a further resolution from meeting No. 63, which was obviously held this morning. Mr Deputy President, I would like to read that into the record. As I said, I read it without trying in any way to colour the position the President might eventually reach. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the resolution passed at the 62nd Commission meeting concerning the presentation of papers and submissions, the Board of Commissioners wishes to inform the Senate that this resolution:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. was not intended to in any way encroach upon or limit the powers of the Senate or any Parliamentary Committee;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. was not intended to prevent or in any way affect the right of individuals to appear before the Senate or such committees;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. was a purely administrative mechanism designed to ensure that papers and submissions presented on behalf of the ADC contained information that was accurate and reflected the views of the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA>and that the Board regrets any misunderstanding that may have occurred as a result of the passage of this resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>That was conveyed to Mr President over the signature of the ADC Chairman, Shirley McPherson, and the Acting Deputy Chairman, Patrick Dodson. All I wish to say in relation to that is that I have been involved with Senate committees now for some 10 years. I am sure that Senator Boswell, in his shorter time in the Senate, has been involved with Senate committees, too. Quite commonly, witnesses come before us who claim that the submission that they have put in writing or are about to make orally has been compiled on behalf of, or is about to be put on behalf of, some organisation or another. It has been my quite common experience to question such witnesses and try to ascertain whether the proper processes have been gone through by the organisation which they purport to represent. Particularly where we have national organisations of a federal character, where quite complex processes are involved in getting the final approval of the summit or peak board, one finds that the matter has not been completely processed in a way which would enable one to say that the submission is the view of that organisation as represented by its ultimate governing body. As I read the resolution of meeting No. 63 it would harmonise with that sort of approach which is, as I say, quite commonly found in the work of Senate committees. I do not doubt that Senator Boswell himself has been present on an occasion when a witness has withdrawn a document or changed the status of a document under that sort of questioning by a Senate committee. As I said, I do not want to prejudice the consideration of this matter by the President in this particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the appearance of witnesses before Estimates Committee E and the presentation of answers, may I say that I met with Mrs McPherson late last night. She informed me that draft answers had been prepared in response to not dozens but perhaps 200 questions put to the Commission by Senator Tambling last Friday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless today is only Thursday. To have those draft answers to several hundred questions compiled and ready for consideration by the board of the commissioners this morning represents a magnificent effort of will, dedication and damn hard work by the officers of the Aboriginal Development Commission. Those answers have been compiled in a way which will be helpful to the Senate Estimates Committee when it meets. I am sure that as soon as the ADC processes those responses for transmission to the Estimates Committee they will be made available-I would imagine sometime late this morning or early this afternoon. I ought to make it very clear that there is no attempt to delay or frustrate the responses to Senator Tambling's questions. Any department or agency that was confronted with that task a mere five or six days ago is to be commended if it produced those answers within that short period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the appearances of witnesses before the Estimates Committee, honourable senators will understand that it is for the Minister to answer questions and to determine who shall assist. I think I took the view in answer to the first question completely without notice that the chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission ought to be there as the properly constituted chairperson. I took the view that the personality of the character did not matter but that the person holding the office of General Manager should be there, and that is what I said in response to Senator Boswell off the cuff. That is still my view. Other officers of the Aboriginal Development Commission can be there to assist also. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not finally determined a view because, to be absolutely frank with honourable senators, it is not clear from the responses which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has had from the ADC-and the various letters coming out of Question Time are the only knowledge that I have-what the status of certain persons within the ADC is. When that is clarified perhaps in the course of the day, we will be able to determine who shall appear at the Estimates Committee hearings. I remind honourable senators that Estimates committees are not like ordinary standing committees which can compel the attendance of persons and the presentation of documents. For Estimates committees, the Minister chooses who shall help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me define very precisely what we are talking about. We are now talking about the seven-week delay that Senator Sheil said occurred. I understand that he appointed that staff member on about 11 July. I table a letter from Senator Sheil, dated 10 August, in which he notified the Department of that appointment. It is only on such notification that the Department can instruct someone to pay. In fact, this was sent by fax. I table the instruction, given on receipt of that letter and dated 10 August, that payment be made. I table the transaction data from the Nomad payroll system for the payment made on 15 August, five days later. There was not a seven-week delay from when the Department first knew that this staff member had been appointed; there was a five-day delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us move to the more serious point of misleading. Senator Sheil tells me that the salary payment in the other case I mentioned was up to the staff member and that, if that staff member chose to work without pay, that was her affair. But let us see what the staff member said. In a letter to the Department on 11 July 1988, she said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> Attached find Pro forma agreement for a member of Electorate staff. </PARA>
<PARA> This letter is by way of explanation for the delay in submitting form. I commenced working with the Senator on Monday 13th April 1987-commuting each day between my home in Brisbane and the office in Surfers Paradise. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Senator was away in Canberra and various parts of the Electorate and the forms were not completed. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Sheil to note that. Senator Sheil's own employee says that the lack of back pay was because Senator Sheil was busy and forms were not completed. I go back to quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation has now arisen that Senator Sheil requires me to travel to Canberra on various occasions and consequently the forms are essential for a number to be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Please advise if anything is overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I table a letter from Senator Sheil to the Department, again dated 10 August. Obviously Senator Sheil put in a hard day's work. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Crawford,</PARA>
<PARA> This is to confirm that Elma Jorgensen commenced duties in my office on 13th April 1987 as Electorate Secretary-Grade 2-replacing Cheryl Huddleston who left on Friday 10th April 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The necessary papers were not completed immediately but have now been forwarded to both the Brisbane and Canberra offices of the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise this point because Senator Sheil rushed out from this chamber on the basis of an incomplete answer from me, and issued a press release saying that this was a shocking state of affairs. I do not believe what the honourable senator has said to me today. I do not believe this person was not paid for 16 months. Senator Sheil tells me that it was her decision, but I have a letter here that suggests that the failure to pay was because he did not complete the paperwork. I am minded to put the matter in the hands of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was originally referred to the Committee on 8 October 1987. It was supplemented on 1 June 1988 by additional terms of reference relating to the proposed tax file numbering scheme announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the 1988 May economic statement. The Committee has completed the report as expeditiously as possible in order to assist the Senate in its consideration of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill, which is before the Parliament, and the Privacy Bill, which is said to be imminent. The Committee has discussed principles relevant to both pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 110 submissions. It held public hearings in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those people and organisations who made submissions and appeared before the Committee in public hearings. The Senate referred specific questions to the Committee, which it has answered. The answers to some are not as comprehensive as the Committee would have liked. This is because there was a paucity of evidence in respect of them. In some cases, the material was not made available-for example, the Australian Federal Police material referred to in terms of reference (d). In other cases, it apparently did not exist-for example, detailed estimates of the costs to the private sector of establishing and maintaining any national identity system. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 September 1988. The Australian Taxation Office made a submission to the Committee in relation to the tax file number proposal and also appeared before the Committee. While this was of assistance to the Committee, the Committee was generally of the view that more comprehensive information and analysis would have helped it in its considerations. The Committee did not have access to the draft Privacy Bill 1988, which has been foreshadowed by both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Committee understands that the draft is still subject to alterations before it is finally brought before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sees this report as an important contribution to the debate on both the tax file numbers Bill and the Privacy Bill 1988, when it is introduced. The Committee's principal recommendation is that appropriate privacy legislation be enacted without delay and certainly not later than the commencement of any proposed tax file number scheme. The Committee regards this as essential. The Committee recommends that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data be adopted as the minimum standard for this privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the privacy watchdog, which it recommended be established under privacy legislation, should, in addition to overseeing the protection of privacy, examine various matters, including the confidentiality of medical records, arrangements concerning information sharing between government agencies and the extent of data surveillance. The Committee has also recommended that the privacy watchdog consider the question of the possible regulation of the private sector by privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the operation of the privacy watchdog be referred to this Committee for review after a suitable period of time. This is because the privacy legislation and the mechanisms set up under it will be unique in this country and untested. The Senate will note that this Committee fulfilled a similar and useful role in relation to the operation and administration of the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, may I personally thank all the members of the Committee, who worked hard and expeditiously on producing this report. I understand that members of the Committee wish to speak after me, but I would like to inform the Senate that there are addendums to the report-one from Senator Alston and one from Senator Hill. I put them in that order simply because Senator Alston's name starts with an A and Senator Hill's name starts with an H and not according to the quality of the mind that was brought to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should start by thanking the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and my colleagues for their work in relation to the report, and particularly Bronwyn McNaughton, the secretary of the Committee, and her staff. The task to produce this report within the time frame was not easy, particularly with the pressure put on in this place over the last few weeks in relation to the Government wishing to deal with this matter in the Parliament. I believe that the Senate will find the report useful. I remind the Senate that the Committee is unanimous in its support for the recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry arose from the original ID card Bill-the Australia Card, as some people refer to it. It gave the Parliament an opportunity-perhaps for the first time; certainly in recent times-to look at the whole question of the quantity of personal information that is held by governments; by which departments it is held, and the capacity for that information to be exchanged between departments, and what sorts of safeguards exist to ensure that it is not abused. Following the Australian Law Reform Commission's report it was time for the Parliament to give consideration to those particularly important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We found that there is an enormous amount of personal information held by government. It was impossible, in fact, to assess adequately the quantum of that information. We indicate in our report that we believe it is something that should be pursued further, hopefully by some sort of watchdog privacy body. We accept, of course, that it is necessary for governments to have personal information. Obviously, in areas such as social security, health, and even income tax, personal information is critical for the proper functioning of government. But it is the view certainly of those of us on this side of the chamber that government should not have any more information than is absolutely necessary, and that what government can do with personal information should be strictly regulated. I think it is clear to us as a result of this inquiry-speaking for myself-that it is not adequately regulated at the moment. Thus the Committee came to the conclusion that privacy legislation is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> We were a little more uncertain as to whether privacy legislation was warranted in relation to the private sector because the information is not gathered in the compulsory way that a government gains information and also because the information is not as extensive. Nevertheless, we said it is a matter that should be further pursued. We make the suggestion that a new privacy body should look into the question of whether legislation is necessary for the private sector as soon as reasonably possible. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises the question of privacy legislation. The Committee, of course, said that the operation of any tax file number legislation should not be commenced until there is adequate privacy legislation. That led to a difficult position for the Committee in that we all knew that there was a Bill about, but the most recent Bill produced by the Government was not before the Committee. That is regrettable. It would have been more useful to the Parliament if it had had the opportunity to discuss this Senate Committee's assessment of the Government's proposed privacy legislation. As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) is in the chamber, I add that I would prefer the Bill to be introduced or at least circulated so that the debate that is taking place upon it at the moment was extended to at least give other parliamentarians the opportunity to give consideration to the terms of that Bill. A copy has been provided to the shadow Attorney-General and that is useful to a limited extent, but I think all of us would like the opportunity to consider the details of that Bill and to be able to seek the advice of others and give it proper consideration. I find it a little more disturbing when we learn that some third parties outside the Parliament claim to have copies of that Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not suggested that. I do not know who provided them. It would be helpful if parliamentarians generally were provided with copies of the draft seeing that the draft is being debated to some extent in limited circles and in some ways in wider circles. Nevertheless, this is a shortcoming of our report-that in the timeframe that has been provided and because the Bill has not been introduced or made public, it was not possible for our Committee to deal with the contents of that Bill. It was, however, possible for us to set what we think are a number of worthwhile standards for privacy legislation by which any Bill that might be introduced could be examined. That is what we sought to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That leads me to addendum one to which my name is attached. Honourable senators will note that it is not described as a dissenting report. I would put it more in terms of a qualification. There was one conclusion-it did not lead to a recommendation-which, in my assessment, did not stand up to the evidence that was put before the Committee. That related to the question as to whether it had been demonstrated that the revenue that government would gain by the proposed tax file number system would amount to a significant benefit to the revenue. I guess `significant' can only be looked at in a subjective sense, but certainly I was looking at the question as to whether there was sufficient evidence for the Committee to come to a conclusion that a substantial revenue advantage would be obtained as a result of the introduction of the new scheme. It was my conclusion that on the evidence-and the principal evidence was that of the Australian Taxation Office-that case had not been made out. I went on to say in the addendum, and I think it was important to say, that I believe before a tax file number system is introduced there is an onus on government and the proponents of such a scheme to show that there are not less intrusive methods that could be used to achieve a similar result. In the evidence that was put before the Committee I certainly was not convinced that there were no other less intrusive methods that could, in fact, achieve a similar result. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, in explaining what I have just said, we know that the Australian Taxation Office very effectively in recent years has been building a matching capacity-to match sources of revenue to taxpayers. In fact, we were told in evidence that there are now approximately 12 million entries that are matched each year. This has been successful and has resulted in an ever increasing number of assessments being amended with an ever increasing revenue benefit in tax and penalties. I set that out on page 2 of addendum 1, the information being taken from the Taxation Office's evidence. We find with the existing system that in the year 1987-88 some $139m had been produced through the Taxation Office's matching capacity. It is important to realise that that matching capacity is proving effective because of the very extensive powers that the Parliament has already given to the Taxation Office to make such a facility operative. I set out those further powers on page 2 of the addendum. We have now provided an obligation on employers to report details of salaries and wages paid, on companies to report details of all interest payments made in excess of $100, on companies to report to the Australian Taxation Office details of all dividend payments made, and on payers of payments made subject to the prescribed payment system to report details of payments made. So it could be said that we have already gone down the path of intrusive type legislation a great deal. As I said, that has given the Australian Taxation Office the significant capacity to match sources of income with taxpayers. That would seem to be being done reasonably effectively, accepting that there is room for the existing system to be be extended yet further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's preference is to introduce a new methodology, a taxation file number system, that will oblige taxpayers to provide a unique identifier, their tax number, when carrying out a whole series of private commercial transactions, whether it be in relation to their banking, the purchase of shares or financial transactions of that nature. I say in this addendum that, firstly, I do not believe that the evidence that has been put before us warrants that intrusion and, secondly, the Government has not exhausted the alternatives of further development of the existing scheme, short of this further legislative intrusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, if we look at the sums that the Australian Taxation Office says will be produced by this unique identifier method, I do not believe that they stand critical analysis. The two principal parts were basically from group certificates that are not lodged and from interest that is not declared. In relation to the group certificates, as I recall the evidence the calculation was made from a very small sample of 500 and, of the 500, only 100 could not be traced. But when we examined those that could be traced further we saw that 65 per cent of them represented group certificates that would actually result in the taxpayer getting a refund. Those refunds were not quantified in the evidence that was put before the Committee; therefore, it is impossible for us to come to a net figure. The figure given by the Taxation Office was not a net figure; it was a gross figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, it was said in evidence that the refunds are likely to be smaller sums of money than those when tax is payable. But, of course, large sums of money are independently investigated by the Taxation Office, as is the case at present. I was not left in a position where I could be confident that, when the figure was netted out, it would come anywhere near the sum that was claimed by the Australian Taxation Office in its evidence. Furthermore, as we know, the recent amnesty has resulted in a large number of new taxpayers being brought into the system and the effect of that was also not taken into account and I suggest that that will reduce the opportunity to gain funds through a tax file number system. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the other half of the equation-the interest that is not currently declared-again there was no significant scientific reason to reach the figure that was claimed by the Australian Taxation Office. It resulted from a survey that was done in 1983-84, a very long time ago, before the Tax Office commenced to develop the sophisticated matching arrangement that it presently has and, in addition, it was as a result of what the Tax Office has described as `a feel for the matter'. It is my view that those who are proponents of the scheme who seek to justify these figures need to produce better evidence than that to the Parliament. We must accept that, even in the way the Government intends to structure this new scheme, a very large number of taxpayers will not be included-pensioners and children under 16-and that amounts to some millions of bank accounts that are unlikely to be included. So there has to be a major flaw in the matching capacity. I would have thought that anyone would accept that point. When we finally got to the bottom line it was interesting to find that, in the opinion of the Department, if the new scheme was introduced, 70 per cent of the interest might still be avoided. So it is far from a foolproof scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to weigh the intrusions against the benefits. In my respectful submission, as I have said in this addendum, that did not match up. As I said in the final part of the addendum, I would much prefer the Government to be looking at the alternatives to bring partnerships, trusts and companies within the current matching system which would bring in another one million business taxpayers and significantly improve the matching capacity. I believe that the Government could look further at using payee account numbers, something which was dismissed somewhat superficially by the Taxation Office in its evidence. To me that is a less intrusive method which will produce the same results. In summary, that is a qualification to one of the conclusions but the recommendations are unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me simply stress that we, on this side of the chamber, are not seeking in this addendum not to reduce tax avoidance. We are looking at a more effective scheme so that there will be less tax avoidance. But we say that, in developing that scheme, the losses of personal privacy and unnecessary intrusions must always be weighed against the advantages to be gained. Every effort must be made in framing legislation to avoid unnecessary intrusions. As I have stated in the addendum, I believe that there are more effective, less intrusive ways of achieving the same goal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Hill said quite correctly, this report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was prepared under a great deal of pressure. However, the report is a carefully considered one and I am afraid that, as usual, the pressure was mostly borne by the staff of the Committee. They worked very long hours on this report and, as the final additions to it were not even in the hands of the staff until the middle of yesterday afternoon, I think they have performed a commendable job in having this report, in its completed form, tabled in the chamber this morning. I would like to commend Kathleen Gibson, Barry Jenkins-I will not ask them to stand up and take a bow-Stephen Argument and Bronwyn McNaughton for the enormous amount of work and the very fine drafting job that they have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Alston and Senator Hill have done the Opposition's case on the tax file number a great deal of damage. In fact, it would have been much safer for Senator Alston and Senator Hill not to have made this addendum to the report because not only have they made fools of themselves but also they have made fools of the Opposition. A number of cynics, perhaps on this side of the House and maybe in the community at large, feel that the Opposition's concern about privacy matters-I stress that its concern has rested on privacy matters-is not genuine but is simply a sham and a fraud in attempting to delay and defer, once again, the Government's opportunity to introduce this proposal to crack down on tax cheats. Of course, the Opposition is sensitive to the fact that, because of its previous full-blooded support for the upgraded tax file number-which I will move to shortly-it cannot now simply capriciously reject it; it has to search around for some reason to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still prepared to give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt as to its concern about privacy issues. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has stated very clearly that it is predicated on the Opposition's satisfaction with the details of the privacy legislation, that the Opposition's support for, or rejection of, the tax file number will be based on that. I am prepared to give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt. But do we find any mention of concerns about privacy? In Senator Alston's and Senator Hill's addendum to this report we do not. For the first time that I am aware of in the debate we have a complete switch-I will quote from the addendum itself-on where the Opposition now lies. </PARA>
<PARA> From the evidence that was given to this Committee and from the record of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in providing estimates-which I will get to shortly-I would have thought that we could have opposed the upgraded tax file number on a great many grounds, but not that one. Before I get to the addendum I will canvass a number of key paragraphs in the report itself and I will be brief because of time constraints. Paragraph 2.21 of the report, quoting a term of reference, says that the Committee had to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA>the taxation file numbering scheme announced by the Treasurer in the May Economic Statement, and, in particular, whether the scheme is likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and to eliminate fraud and abuses in the taxation and social security systems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concluded in the next paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the tax file numbering scheme proposed by the Treasurer is likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and to assist in the elimination of fraud and abuse of that system. </PARA>
<PARA>I highlight paragraph 9.39 of the report because this is the paragraph that Senator Hill and Senator Alston have some difficulty with. The majority of the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number scheme is likely to result in a substantial overall gain in revenue by eliminating certain areas of fraudulent practice in, and abuse of, the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say that there are other areas-as Senator Hill quite rightly said-of abuse that the enhanced tax file number scheme will not address. I turn to Senator Hill's and Senator Alston's addendum. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA> On the evidence put to the Committee we are not satisfied that the tax file number would result in a significant increase in revenue. We therefore disagree with the view of the majority of the Committee on this point. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say, and these are the two grounds on which this position is based:</PARA>
<PARA> On the evidence put to the Committee we are not satisfied that other less intrusive methods do not exist. Indeed, we express disappointment at the cursory manner in which alternative approaches were treated in the ATO submission. </PARA>
<PARA>So the position of the Opposition in the Senate in respect of this matter--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I apologise. The position of Senator Alston and Senator Hill on this matter is that they are not satisfied to support the tax file number on the grounds, first, that they dispute the assessment of the Taxation Office that there will be significant gains in revenue and, second, that there are other less intrusive methods of raising revenue. On the question of whether the Committee could fairly be expected to accept the evidence of the Taxation Office on the question of revenue raising I just say this: I, along with other members of the Committee, had some dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Taxation Office presented some of its case and those concerns are reflected-I might add-in paragraphs 9.26 and 9.30 of the report. But I had no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the estimates the Taxation Office provided on the significant revenue to be gained from the implementation of this measure. The reason I made that assessment on the evidence is this, and I quote from the submission given to the Committee by the Australian Taxation Office:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Calculation of the tax file number revenue estimates followed a similar methodology to that used in calculating the Australia Card revenue estimates, with reductions to reflect the narrower uses and lower integrity of the tax file number proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a reference, and I have the full reference with me, in the report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card, but it is quoted here, that the majority report-in fact I think it was unanimous on this point-of the Joint Select all-party Committee on an Australia Card said at paragraph 1.42:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee accepts estimates made by the Australian Taxation Office and notes that they may be a substantial underestimation of final benefits obtainable under the proposal. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Underestimation. It is also fair, I think, to have a look at the Taxation Office's record in providing estimates to committees of all kinds of this Parliament and Budget estimates and at what sort of consistent record it has achieved in providing such estimates. I would like to note in respect of this the comment of the Commonwealth Auditor-General in the 1986 efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office where he said that the key assumptions underlying the revenue estimates by the Taxation Office may be conservative. I in fact have a copy of the 1986 efficiency audit with me. It is a comprehensive document and it would take me too long to quote from it fully, but that is a fair summary of what the Commonwealth Auditor-General said about the estimates of the Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now, does the Commonwealth Auditor-General, and do I, have reasonable grounds for believing that the Taxation Office has a consistent record of conservatism and care in underestimating estimates? Yes, he does and I do. Again, without being exhaustive about it-and I can assure Senator Hill and Senator Alston, and the Senate, that I could quote considerably more than I am about to here-but just going to the immediate past, I would like the Senate to consider the estimates that were provided by the Taxation Office on a number of Budget measures in the 1987-88 financial year compared with the actual revenue received. I only have to go back one year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Office estimated that in that financial year $530m would be received from the fringe benefits tax. The actual figure was $881m. On capital gains tax the Taxation Office estimated that we would receive $5m from that measure. The actual figure received was $400m. In the area of entertainment, the estimate from the Taxation Office was that $330m would be achieved from that measure. The actual figure was in fact $330m. On substantiation requirements, the estimate from the Australian Taxation Office was that $105m would be received. The actual receipts were $350m. I would also point out-and I could go on and on-that the company tax collections in 1987-88 were $1.1 billion higher than the Taxation Office estimates. There is a reason for that. It is that the professional officers who work for the Australian Taxation Office do tend to be ultra-conservative, for obvious reasons, and careful in the estimates that they provide on revenue. There is a fairly commonsense reason for that. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one is going to pillory the Tax Office or the officers concerned if they say, `We are going to collect $100m' and we collect $300m. No-one is going to pillory the Taxation Office if $1.1 billion is collected in addition to their estimates. No-one is going to pillory the Taxation Office if $881m is collected instead of $530m. But, of course, a great deal would be said if there were substantial over-estimates. The fact is, and the Committee was in a position to consider this because we had all of this evidence I am quoting now before us, that the Taxation Office has an impeccable record, acknowledged by the Commonwealth Auditor-General, of consistently being conservative in the estimates provided to committees or to the Treasurer or wherever else. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore I think the Committee was entitled, despite any minor complaints reflected in our report with the presentation made by the Taxation Office, on the record and on the facts before us, to accept the estimates of the Australian Taxation Office as a conservative estimate of what might be collected by this Budget measure. Those estimates, for the benefit of the Senate, are that there will be a gross increase in collections over a 10-year period of $2.2 billion, with an estimated cost of collecting those revenues of less than $300m, giving a ratio of $8.07 collected for every dollar expended in that collection. Frankly, I do not know how one can ignore submissions such as that. The Australian Taxation Office has a very good record in two areas. It has a very good record in the impeccable way it preserves the confidentiality of its records, and it has a very good record of consistently providing conservative estimates of its revenue collections. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the brilliant solution that Senators Hill and Alston provide as an alternative to the tax file number. They say that they are extremely disappointed that we did not do enough work on that and that, indeed, the Tax Office did not provide better alternatives. What would they do? I turn to page 124 of the report, and here it is:</PARA>
<PARA>The first alternative is to further develop the existing matching facility without the intrusion of a new obligatory tax file number identification. </PARA>
<PARA>There are only three paragraphs here. The next one canvasses the question of payee account numbers. The third paragraph refers back to the first paragraph. The final paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly without first exhausting the capacities of the existing matching facility further legislative intrusions on personal privacy are unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA>So the only solution offered as an alternative by Senators Hill and Alston is an improvement in the existing matching facilities. I think it is fair to have a look at what the Taxation Office said about this. I refer the Senate to the submission given to this Committee by the ATO. Again I cannot, in the time available to me, be exhaustive about this, so I will have to provide a summary. I think it is a compelling summary to anyone who understands even the basics of computer systems and databases. This is what the ATO said in paragraph 2.8 of its submission:</PARA>
<PARA>It is in recognition of these factors and concern for the level of evasion that the ATO has been expanding its income matching activities in recent years, primarily in the area of interest reporting and matching. That expansion is reflected in the results that have been achieved, measured in terms of assessments amended and the resultant tax and penalties raised. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very measure that Senator Hill is providing as the only alternative to the upgraded tax file number. It goes on in paragraph 2.9 to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the progress that has been made, the conduct of the Income Matching Program is considerably labour intensive, much of this being due to the system of name and address matching on which it is based. </PARA>
<PARA>I should have thought that that was one of those truths we hold to be self-evident. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, program results fall well short of realising their full potential, for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the difficulties experienced in computer based name and address matching for individuals (refer para 3.4 et seq.), no attempts have been made to date to devise a systems-based matching facility in respect of partnership, trust and company taxpayers (refer para 3.9 et seq.). Thus, a very large number of business taxpayers-in excess of 1 million-who derive interest income are excluded from the interest reporting and matching element of the Income Matching Program. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill and Senator Alston must have been asleep when the ATO was presenting the Committee with that evidence. I find it compelling evidence not just in terms of being prepared to accept the professional assessment of taxation officers, but purely in terms of a commonsense assessment of the clumsiness and expense of a system that relies on names and addresses rather than a system that simply relies on matching two identical numbers. As I said when I opened this contribution, I do not think Senators Hill and Alston have helped themselves in terms of their own credibility, and certainly the credibility of the Opposition, on this issue. But then we get to the most astonishing part of this addendum, where Senators Hill and Alston say:</PARA>
<PARA> Yet even with the enhanced tax file number system a large number of income sources will not be matched because pensioners (2.5 million) and children (4 million) are excluded. It is suspected that the largest potential revenue is from small income earners as large unaccounted income is already presently investigated. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not tell the Senate what I have written across that particular paragraph. The only interpretation that can be placed on that paragraph is that Senators Hill and Alston are not satisfied with the upgraded tax file number because it does not go far enough in including `small income earners' in the collection of revenue. I have no hesitation in saying comprehensively and categorically that the Government has not the slightest intention of introducing the Hill/Alston upgraded tax file number and coming down on 2.5 million Australian pensioners and four million children that the Government has excluded from the provisions of the Bill. The Government has no intention of following the Hill/Alston upgraded tax file number plan, but I must say that, with respect to the current position of the Opposition, I would describe this contribution or this addendum as perverse. </PARA>

Is Senator Hill once again saying-and I assume he is-by necessary inference that he will agree with the tax file number only when it covers that section that is excluded?

<PARA>. . . even with the enhanced tax file number system, a large number of income sources will not be matched because pensioners (2.5 million) and children (4 million) are excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>There is enough inference in the first sentence but it is unmistakable in the second. I will quote the second sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>It is suspected that the largest potential revenue is from small income earners . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That includes the pensioners and children that Senators Hill and Alston have just mentioned. Of course, there is a large potential tax source in those 2.5 million pensioners and four million children but the Government has no intention of collecting it. It is, as I said, a fairly perverse contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Opposition has said previously about the upgraded tax file number. I refer to the report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card. I am quoting from the majority report, with the only dissent, let me remind honourable senators, being from Labor Party members-yes, Senator Haines-of this Committee. Let me quote what the majority report, the Opposition's report, said. Paragraph 1.42 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is unanimous in its view that tax evasion must be tackled as vigorously as possible. While it does have strong doubts that the so-called black economy, especially the cash economy, can be tackled by any one measure including the Australia Card proposal, it believes that every effort must be made to reduce tax evasion. Overall, the Committee accepts the estimates made by the Australian Taxation Office and notes that they may be a substantial underestimation of final benefits obtainable under the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, that is evidence-agreed to by the Opposition-of the practice of the ATO to be conservative in its estimates, a position now being rejected by Senator Hill and Senator Alston. It goes on in paragraph 4.19-and this was the then position of the Opposition-to say:</PARA>
<PARA>4.19 The majority of the Committee considers as an appropriate option the upgrading of the tax file number to a level of integrity equivalent to that of the Australia Card number . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that: `upgrading to the equivalent of the Australia Card number'. In other words, not so long ago the Opposition was perfectly happy to insist on a level of integrity of the upgraded tax file number greater than that now currently proposed by the Government. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also considers the legislation enacted to require financial institutions to use the tax file number should include a requirement that the information reported to the ATO be provided in an acceptable format. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I want to turn to the special addendum to the report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card, put by Senator Puplick, the Senate's Opposition representative on this Committee. The addendum section is headed `There is a better way'. This is what Senator Puplick says:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the members of the Joint Select Committee share many of my concerns about the Australia Card proposal. As a result they have decided on balance to recommend against adoption of the Government's proposal in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA>The second sentence is the important one. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> However, we realise that this casts upon us-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>a clear responsibility to recommend some alternative which addresses at least the area of particular concern, namely tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not say it better than that myself. I think a considerable responsibility rests on the Opposition to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the alternative that the Opposition-and indeed the Senate Opposition-seized upon? It was this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Report of the Joint Select Committee thus proposes as its central recommendation the use of an improved and upgraded system based upon a tax file number of higher integrity than that currently used. There are several consequential recommendations, such as those having to do with resource allocations for the Tax Office and improvements in procedures for other Departments . . . These recommendations have my support. I believe they adequately address areas of prime concern without at the same time posing the threats to privacy and civil liberties which I see as inevitable consequences arising from the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the contribution made by Senator Alston and Senator Hill in their addendum to this report-that is, that the tax file number should not be supported because we cannot trust the estimates of the Australian Taxation Office in terms of the level of estimates that it has provided for the revenue gained by this measure-has exposed the Liberal Party, at least in the Senate, as being a sham and a fraud on the question of the upgraded tax file number. I hope that their colleagues in the House of Representatives will be able to persuade them that their proper and correct concern should be addressed to the matter of the adequacy of the privacy legislation-I might add, a matter which was not mentioned at all in the addendum to this report by Senator Hill and Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I have been assured by the office of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the Government has no intention of attacking the 2.5 million pensioners and the four million schoolchildren whom Senator Alston and Senator Hill want attacked and that the exclusions that have been provided by this Government for revenue collections from those two groups of people will be maintained. </PARA>

We are talking about implementing a potentially intrusive piece of legislation in order to gain 26c per week per person, when there are other methods that are less intrusive that would raise the same amount of money. I do not want to sound peevish in questioning the Government's integrity in claiming that this is the only means whereby it could raise 26c per person per week. Far be it from me to be peevish. However, I remind honourable senators, and the one journalist who has sufficient interest in this matter to be in the gallery, that in 1985 the Government told us that the only way to recoup the $1 billion that it claimed was lost annually through tax and social security cheating was to introduce a national identification system.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Aulich should realise that one cannot get the same blood out of the same stone, so I presume that the Government was saying that the Australia Card was not the only way of recouping that money and that there were other methods that could be used. The Government used them and recouped four-fifths of that lost revenue. I will not go into those details now. I made a speech on 7 October 1987 and, if Senator Aulich or anyone else wants to look at the various measures that the Government put into place, both through legislation and through administrative decisions, he can go back and have a look at that list. Therefore, I am a little cautious about Government suggestions that this is the only way to recoup the remaining $200m a year-the remaining 26c per person per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins is perfectly correct in saying that the report from the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card talked about using an upgraded, high integrity tax file number-provided that this was done in an acceptable format.

<PARA> I have seen press reports in the Age, for example, as recently as yesterday which claim that the Liberal Party of Australia-and I presume that they include the National Party of Australia in that description-and the Australian Democrats are opposing this legislation because we support tax cheats and social security defrauders. Claude Forell, who wrote the article, listed his tax file number at the top of it and said that he did not care who knew his number. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I do not particularly care who knows Senator Collins's number or my number either, but that is not the point at issue. Mr Forell claimed that anybody who opposed this legislation had something to hide or was prepared to hide something for other people. Let me say categorically that neither I nor any of my colleagues in the Australian Democrats support tax cheats or social security defrauders. However, I do question the Government's sincerity about recouping revenue when it has inserted in various pieces of tax law measures that allow some companies in this country to legally pay less than one cent in the dollar in tax year after year after year. When the Government comes to terms with that, I will accept that it is far more sincere in its attitude to raising revenue than it has demonstrated to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats are not opposed to Government attempts to catch the cheats or people defrauding the system. Our record on supporting the Government on legislation such as the prescribed payments scheme to crack down on the cash economy is evidence of this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To this stage there has not been any requirement for anybody in receipt of a tax file number to prove that he is who he says he is. That has been the source of massive problems, with individuals having several tax file numbers in several different names. I noticed in one of the newspapers this week that the Tax Office had the unmitigated gall to complain about the fact that it could only locate these people accidentally, if they were silly enough to list the same address for each of their false names. The ATO has a perfectly acceptable remedy for this. It could take exactly the same measure as is taken with regard to passports-that is, to require proof of identity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Democrats have been opposed to, and what they will continue to be opposed to, is any attempt by any government to impose a national identification card system on this country or any system that would facilitate its introduction. To help the Government in its revenue-raising capacity, to help it collect this outstanding $200m per year, most of which emanated from a failure by people to report interest earned on bank or building society accounts or in other interest bearing areas, I went to the Government late in 1987 with an alternative proposal which would have used the tax file number but which would have retained the current system, whereby the tax file number is known only to the Australian Tax Office and to the holder of the number. It would have raised the revenue but it would not have laid the groundwork for a future national identification system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell, in her addendum to the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-and, like Senator Hill, I want it to be noted that it is not a dissenting report from the majority report; it is simply an addendum-points out that any numbering system designed to eliminate fraud and abuse in the taxation system must accomplish two things. Firstly, it must operate efficiently to catch tax evaders. Until we improve the integrity of tax file numbers there will not be a great deal of efficiency in the system. Secondly, it must provide adequate protection against invasion of privacy. Senator Powell points out in paragraph 3 that the current system proposed by the Government has enormous potential for the invasion of people's privacy. She then goes on to give-as, I understand it, other people have not-an alternative, based on the scheme that I talked about to senior officers in the Department of the Treasury 12 months ago. It is a simple, efficient system involving a scheme similar to group certificates, and not difficult to comprehend. So, for example, with regard to bank accounts, a customer would go into a branch, give her name, get the account details and her name entered on a form that would be in quadruplicate. And let us not fancy that we do not have this system. Senator Collins is screwing up his nose. What the heck does he think group certificates are?</PARA>

It means that the bank does not have the tax file number, but the recipient and the Tax Office do. I will not go into the details; they are in the addendum. As Senator Powell points out in paragraph 5, the system we are proposing is similar to the system of group certificates. It is more than appropriate. It is not too late for the Government to rethink this issue and restructure its system along those lines. I doubt whether there would be an individual in this place who would oppose something similar to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Powell's addendum also deals with the question of privacy, pointing out-it is a very valuable paragraph-that the minimum requirements for privacy legislation are that it must be based on comprehensive, plainly expressed guidelines. She suggests that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines would be appropriate, that the private sector must be regulated, that enforceable remedies must be available and that a watchdog or privacy commissioner must be established and vested with adequate powers and independence. Finally, an appeals mechanism must exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The ball is definitely in the Government's court. The Government has the capacity to recoup the 26c per person per week loss in revenue, and without infringing the confidentiality provisions currently existing between the Tax Office and the individual.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel compelled to address the Senate on some of the issues raised by speakers on the other side, in particular the Australian Democrats. This Government is, undoubtedly, sincere in its desire to pursue tax reform. No government in the last 40 years has done it so zealously or with such consistency. What we wanted was the support of the Democrats in this chamber in that process. Firstly, we brought in the Australia Card proposal-a high integrity number system which would have brought in, at least, the revenue which the Government said it would bring in. In fact, I believe that it would have brought in much more revenue. That was my personal view as chairman of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card that investigated that proposal. At the time Senator Haines, as a member of that Committee, said, `Yes, the Democrats are keen to stamp out tax evasion'. Tax evasion was rampant in the community. Everyone, right down to John Howard, believed that that was the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The big question was how we were to stamp out tax evasion. We brought in the Australia Card proposal. What did the Democrats do? They decided that they could not support that proposal because of various concerns about the invasion of civil liberties and so on, but that they would support an upgraded tax file number system, with all the qualifications that Senator Haines talks about. But when the Government brings into this chamber and presents to the public proposals to upgrade the tax file number system, as Senator Haines said we should, what happens? Where are the Democrats again? Quietly, like the Arabs, they have taken their tents away into the night, and stolen away from us, leaving us holding the baby.

The Australia Card was thrown out because the Democrats did not want it. Having put the tax file number system as a proposal, the Democrats now say that they do not want that, either. So where do we go from there? The options are simple. We can go back to an old fashioned approach of the Australian Taxation Office. We can say to the Taxation Office, `You have a problem in this country of tax evasion and minimisation that is damaging the political fabric of our society. You go out and stop it'. So what does the Australian Tax Office do? It uses sections 263 and 264 of the tax Act-powers it has now-which give it untrammelled rights as a government organisation to go into offices and private homes to check records without a warrant and pursue people in a way that, if it did it vigorously, would abuse all the civil rights that Senator Haines believes are so important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of people in both the private and companies areas who are concerned about the way the Tax Office is working. They are concerned because I suppose they are the recipients of the zealousness of the Tax Office. But some of us on this side are concerned that the Tax Office has to use those powers in order to get the revenue that at the moment is being evaded by various groups in the community, particularly those associated with companies.</PARA>
<PARA> May I just mention another point that Senator Haines mentioned. If we really want to get back revenue that is evaded through tax minimisation or genuine evasion in the companies area then we ought to go to those companies and do something about that. I can assure Senator Haines that one of the views that I have long held is that if we really want to stop tax evasion in this country then we have to look at the $2 companies. We should, as a Commonwealth government, go to State governments and say, `Do you want to reform taxation in this country? Do you want to make sure that companies act according to the appropriate way? Then you come to us and we will talk about reforming company codes in this country'. We cannot stop tax evasion until we look at the company codes and the plethora of $2 companies that exist in this society and the ways in which at this stage particularly tax accountants are advising their clients to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two fronts if we are really going to stamp out tax evasion. We have to have an Australia Card. If we do not have that we must have a tax file number of great integrity with the appropriate civil liberties protections. We also need to reform the company codes in the various States through cooperation with the Commonwealth Government. The Government is moving in that direction. We want the Democrats' support. We do not want them to go weak at the knees when we bring into this chamber legislation that has had a great deal of thought and time given to it. I looked at that report. I have to be on the record because a great deal more will be said about this particular issue. I welcome the debate with Senator Haines, which has been going on between us over the last three years. </PARA>

But I have been forced to speak today because I fear very much that there is some possibility, in the light of developments very late in the preparation of this report-Feasibility of a National ID Scheme; the Tax File Number-that the debate on it could be distorted. I am reinforced in that view by the remarks earlier today by my colleague on this side of the chamber Senator Hill, who in speaking particularly to his addendum to the report made a number of statements which, I have to say, I disagree with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important when a Senate standing committee has spent a long time producing a report on an important topic and has presented it to the Senate that the debate arising out of that report should start off on the right foot. It is therefore very clear that we need to get a few facts straight about the matters covered in the report and in the course of the debate earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I want to make in that connection is to note that this report arose out of the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs as long ago as 8 October last year immediately following the defeat of the Australia Card proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only on 1 June this year, eight months later, that a further reference was given to the Senate Committee arising out of the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that he proposed to introduce a tax file numbering system. In the last few weeks, as it became known that the Senate Committee was approaching the end of its labours, and in particular as the tax file number legislation made its way into and partly through the Parliament, public interest, and particularly the interest of the media, intensified. I suggest that the interest related not so much to the original reference to this Committee but to the addendum to that reference, namely, those parts of the reference which deal with the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important, therefore, that we keep the nature of this report in perspective. The report is not principally about the tax file number, although one would be hard put, in the light of the discussion arising out of the tabling this morning, to have drawn that conclusion. The report is principally about the original reference to the Committee and in particular about the questions of privacy to which that reference was principally directed. It is true that the report also covers, in its final two chapters, the tax file number reference. It does so in a very specific manner-a manner specifically directed to its terms of reference rather than to the more generalised concerns that have been raised in many quarters, I think with justice, about the proposal for a tax file number itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's terms of reference have led, therefore, to 16 recommendations. Fifteen of those recommendations deal with the question of privacy and the last of them only deals with the question of the tax file number. I want very briefly to take those points in turn. I do not want to spend time now addressing the recommendations which deal with privacy-the first 15-as they have been touched upon particularly by Senator Hill, if I recall correctly, and by other speakers. I say in passing that, while I agree with much of what Senator Collins said in his earlier remarks, I have to reject his unwarranted imputation that the concern that has been expressed in this report and elsewhere by Opposition senators and by the Opposition more generally about the question of privacy might be thought to spring from a desire-I am not quoting Senator Collins precisely but I do not think I am misrepresenting him-to rationalise the Opposition's prospective opposition to the tax file number. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, as he now reminds me, did say that he was prepared to give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt. I acknowledge his subsequent correction, but I want to put it on the record that I thought his remarks in that respect were less persuasive than some other aspects of his remarks earlier today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to look, however, at recommendation 16, the only recommendation which deals with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988. I emphasise in particular that what that recommendation says-namely, that the Bill should be strictly limited in its terms, and so on-is specifically qualified by the words `if enacted'. It was by definition the unanimous view of the Committee that that recommendation in no way committed any member of the Committee to a view that the tax file number proposal should be enacted. In the final outcome members on the Government side would no doubt have a different view of that from that which members on this side might have, but I underline the importance of those two words, `if enacted'. Having made that comment, I also want to emphasise, as I think has been said by others, that the whole 16 recommendations in this report are unanimously supported by all members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that, as distinct from the formal recommendations contained in the report, the Committee in the course of its deliberations also arrived at some findings, or conclusions, as I think Senator Hill referred to them. I want to mention a very few of those findings in respect of those parts of the report which deal with the privacy questions and that part of the report which deals with the tax file number. In paragraph 9.25 of the report the Committee deals with the tax file number. This finding played a significant part in the discussion this morning. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>It seemed clear on the evidence before the Committee that the introduction of the proposed tax file number scheme would be likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and assist in eliminating some aspects of fraud and abuse in that system. </PARA>
<PARA>In choosing those words the Committee was responding specifically to term of reference (a), one of the two additional terms of reference provided to the Committee by this Senate on 1 June 1988. In paragraph 9.26 of its report the Committee, after briefly surveying the evidence that had been presented to it in relation to the revenue estimates, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, despite the deficiencies-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, some deficiencies in that evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>the Committee accepted that the introduction of the tax file number would result in a significant increase in revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>That conclusion has been qualified by Senators Hill and Alston in addendum 1 to the Committee's report. I was glad to hear Senator Hill say this morning that this addendum constitutes not a dissent but a qualification. The qualification boils down to saying that my two Opposition colleagues did not find the evidence presented to the Committee, particularly by the Australian Taxation Office, sufficiently compelling to enable them to concur in the view, which I quoted a moment ago, in paragraph 9.26 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee carefully surveyed the Australian Taxation Office evidence and the results of its deliberations upon that evidence are contained in paragraphs 9.27 to 9.38 inclusive of its report. In those paragraphs the Committee notes a number of deficiencies which emerged in the course of our examination of the officers from the Taxation Office who appeared before us-an examination in which it is fair to say, as I think the Chairman would acknowledge, that I played a not inconsiderable part. But the bottom line to those paragraphs is that, after having considered the deficiencies in the evidence, the majority of the Committee, including me, concluded that there was no reasonable conclusion other than to agree with the statement in paragraph 9.26; namely that, despite these deficiencies, the Committee accepted that the introduction of the tax file number would result in a significant increase in revenue. I personally regret that, at a very late stage in the Committee's deliberations, my two colleagues on the Opposition side found it impossible finally to concur in that conclusion and felt it necessary to qualify the report in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Since addendum one played a prominent part in the discussion of the Committee's report this morning, and will no doubt continue to do so in the subsequent public debate, I have to say that I think two aspects of that addendum, properly considered, go beyond the ambit of the report. I wish in no way to take fine points concerning the terms of reference or anything of that kind but, in addressing the question of possible alternatives to the tax file number, my colleagues have not confined themselves to the terms of reference of the Committee, which did not provide for an examination of alternatives. As a matter of fact, the Committee had a discussion of that subject at one point of its deliberations, although Senator Hill may not have been present at that time. We concluded, after examination, that there was no provision which would allow us to examine the question of alternatives-and so we did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the second point at which the addendum goes beyond the terms of reference or, rather, falls into what I would have to describe as irrelevance. In paragraphs 12 and 13 it refers first to the question of the exclusion from the proposed tax file number system of pensioners and children and, secondly, to the fact-admitted by the Taxation Office-that, if introduced, the tax file number system would not pick up more than about 30 per cent of interest currently untaxed. Both of those are statements of fact, but they are quite irrelevant to whether or not the Taxation Office's estimate of net revenue gain from the introduction of a tax file number system is justified, which I took to be the matter to which addendum 1 is directed. I simply place those points on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line to this aspect of the Committee's findings, as has been mentioned by an earlier speaker, is in paragraph 9.38 of the report, where the Committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA>The ATO-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian Taxation Office-</PARA>
<PARA>emphasised the overall conservative nature of its estimates</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee acknowledges comments to this effect by the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card, and the Auditor-General-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins referred to both of those matters in his remarks earlier today-</PARA>
<PARA>and accepts that this may be so. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever one may think of the proposals for a tax file number-and those proposals will be addressed when we come to debate the legislation-I do not believe there can be any reasonable doubt that such a device, if it were to be enacted, would result in a significant increase in revenue. The Committee and this Senate in due course will have to weigh the public interest in that revenue gain against the private cost of the potentially very considerable intrusions into personal privacy which might result from such an enactment. That will be the point of the future debate on this matter-not the question of whether or not the device would result in a significant increase in revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to say something about the second term of reference given us on 1 June, namely, the possibility of the tax file number scheme developing into a de facto national identification card system with unacceptable impositions upon privacy and civil liberties. The Committee has addressed this matter in a number of areas of chapter 10 of its report. In paragraph 10.5 the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that there is a danger of any widely dispersed number-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a tax file number-</PARA>
<PARA>becoming a de facto identification, notwithstanding provisions which prescribe penalties for improper use of the number. An examination of the overseas evidence . . . concerning limited use numbers supports this view. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard that as a very important conclusion. It is buttressed in paragraph 10.24, where the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes it is crucial that the strengthened privacy legislation foreshadowed by the Treasurer be in place . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Committee does not elaborate upon what it means by the words `be in place', I have to say that `be in place' means that the privacy legislation has to be enacted by this Parliament and that the privacy commissioner, or whatever the authorised body may be under that legislation, has to be appointed, to have set up office and to be working. Paragraph 10.24 continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no later than the implementation of the proposed tax file numbering scheme, and it has recommended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant finding, with a related recommendation, and one which I think has the most significant consequences for the timing of any proposed tax file number enactment, should that come to pass. Paragraph 10.26 contains the Committee's sole recommendation on this aspect of the terms of reference. The Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, if enacted-</PARA>
<PARA>the words which I stressed at the outset of my remarks-</PARA>
<PARA>be strictly limited in its terms so that it applies only in relation to taxation purposes and those purposes be so framed as to prevent a progressive extension of the ambit of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The bottom line to the Senate's future and more deliberate consideration of this report in due course will be the question of the desirability or otherwise of the tax file number legislation which is currently before the Parliament, although it has not yet been debated in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, under the very capable chairmanship of Senator Cooney and with the assistance of a hardworking and devoted staff, has produced a report which will be of assistance to the Senate in discussing that matter at the appropriate time. Nothing in this report suggests to me that the Committee has come out in favour of the tax file number proposal. If at the appropriate time the Opposition should take the view on the balance of all the considerations-the revenue gains and the tracking down of tax cheats on the one hand against the intrusions into personal privacy on the other-that it should oppose the tax file number legislation, I will certainly support that view, notwithstanding the fact that I, in common with most other members of this Committee, have found in this report that the tax file number system, if introduced, would indeed result in a significant increase in revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment to speak briefly on one matter. In yet another attempt by Senator Walsh to apply his normal tactic of personal smear, this time against the honourable member for Wentworth, Dr Hewson, Senator Walsh at Question Time yesterday said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>According to Dr Hewson's statement of pecuniary interests, he is neither a director nor an economic consultant to the bank although the bank's 1987 annual report records him as `Director and consulting economist'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walsh went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I invite him to clarify his current relationship with the bank. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Macquarie Bank. There is clearly some need to clarify this relationship because of the inference by Senator Walsh of impropriety of some kind. This personal smear by Senator Walsh is, as usual of course, totally false. The reality is that Dr Hewson resigned as a director and consulting economist of the Macquarie Bank on 6 October 1987. This was after all the matters mentioned by Senator Walsh had taken place-speeches and so on and actions on behalf of Macquarie Bank. These were all revealed in Dr Hewson's statement of registrable interests dated 12 October 1987. His Macquarie Bank directorship could not be `revealed as existing' at that time as it did not exist: it had been terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Walsh's information, Macquarie Bank's financial year finishes on 31 March of each year, so the annual report to which Senator Walsh was referring was for the year ended 31 March 1987. The statement of registrable interests was dated 12 October 1987, many months after that date. It is not surprising that Dr Hewson was listed as a director in the 1987 report because, in fact, he was one. But, having resigned in October, he is not listed in the 1988 report as a director of the Macquarie Bank. There is simply no confusion and no impropriety in this matter, except, of course, in the confused and improper attempt by Senator Walsh to smear yet another honourable man, this time Dr Hewson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Prior to November, 1987 the Commonwealth did not undertake any testing of imported cheeses for Listeria contamination. However, following overseas reports of the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in certain surface ripened cheeses and the significance of this for public health, procedures for testing susceptible cheeses were implemented under authority of the Quarantine Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Initial testing, which commenced in November 1987 comprised a spot check survey of an estimated 50% of susceptible cheeses imported. Subsequently, procedures were formalised from January, 1988 under which all cheese consignments from establishments implicated in the overseas reports or which showed failures when tested in Australia are sampled on arrival and detained until analysis has shown them to be clear of contamination. If contamination is found, the consignment is refused entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> All other susceptible cheese imports are subject to random testing, but are not detained pending analysis. The rate of sampling for these cheeses is approximately 90%. If any contamination is found, State Health Departments and the Bureau of Consumer Affairs are advised so that recall action may be instituted. In the event of a contaminated consignment occurring, future shipments from the establishment concerned are subject to 100% sampling and detention pending clearance by analysis. Cheeses which are not susceptible to Listeria contamination are not tested under this program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Twelve of the one hundred and twenty-five samples from the November/December period were found to be contaminated with Listeria. Eleven of these had been released into distribution and State Departments of Health and the Federal Consumer Affairs Bureau were promptly advised to enable recall action to be initiated. The one consignment that had not been released was destroyed under Quarantine supervision at the importer's request. No further positive samples were detected until July this year when one consignment of cheese was found to contain a non-pathogenic strain of Listeria. No recall action was taken on this cheese, but another consignment found to contain pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes was refused entry into Australia. I am advised that most importers have stopped importing from companies implicated in the contamination incidents detected overseas or in the local testing program.</PARA>
