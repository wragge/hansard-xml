<PARA>Dear Senator Bob,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 18 November 1988 where you advised of the Committee's consideration of Export Control Orders No 16 of 1988, Export Control (Fees) Orders as amended (Amendment) made under the Export Control (Orders) Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> You advise that the Committee noted that Clause 3a of the Schedule increases the fee for Quality Assurance System services from $3000 to $5218, there being no explanation in the Explanatory Statement for the reasons for the large increase. You ask for my advice on this. </PARA>
<PARA> While the fee increase to $5218 in 1988/89 represents a large increase, the fees were not altered in 1987/88 owing to large scale developmental activity in inspection practices and procedures in the area of approved quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the detailed examination of the effort expanded by each of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's regional office support areas on individual commodity groups has resulted in some minor reallocations. In small commodity groups such as processed fruit and vegetables (where the total national effort is less than two man years) this slight variation has had the effect of raising charges significantly. It is even more pronounced for the processed fruits and vegetables commodity group as there are only 13 establishments registered under the export control legislation. In 1987/88 the total cost of providing this service was $83,000. This has risen to $128,000 in 1988/89. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the increase in fees it is to be noted that the total industry recovery of $77,000 represents less than 0.1% of the total export earnings of the processed fruits and vegetables commodity group. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for this opportunity of being able to assist the Committee. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="3753" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President,I wish to advise the Senate of the Government's decisions on the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies to which, for the purpose of this statement, I will refer as the Committee. At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the Chairman, Dr Stephen FitzGerald, and the other members of the Committee for their dedication to the very difficult task they had before them, a task which they approached with vigour and imagination. Examination of the issues required a high level of commitment and often personal sacrifice-both of which members gave readily and willingly. I wish to express the Government's appreciation for the personal and collective efforts of all members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to inform honourable senators of the context of the Committee and of the process followed for evaluating its findings. Establishment of the Committee followed a Labor Party election commitment in 1987, in recognition of concerns and misunderstandings about immigration which have grown in recent years. It was the first major examination of immigration in 10 years. In the nine months it took to examine the issues, the Committee conducted consultations with 587 individuals and organisations, received 970 written submissions, and held four workshops for detailed examination of specific topics including selection mechanisms and legislation. In addition, the Committee commissioned 11 consultancies to advise it on a wide range of immigration related topics. The Committee probably undertook the widest ranging examination of immigration in Australia's history and it has set the broad direction for the changes I am about to announce. </PARA>
<PARA> That process was not the end of the story. In tabling the Committee's report in the Parliament on 3 June this year, my predecessor, the Hon. Clyde Holding, announced that there would be a period of three months for public evaluation of and comment on its findings; an interdepartmental committee was to be established to examine its proposals, and the immigration advisory body, the National Population Council, would be asked to advise on certain aspects. Since the report was tabled, working parties of the Council have undertaken detailed analysis and examination of two crucial areas to which I will return later in my address. The working parties have made an invaluable contribution and their advice has been crucial to our consideration of the report. I am indebted to them for their assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The process for evaluating the report has in many senses been as comprehensive as the process which produced it. Twelve government departments participated in the interdepartmental committee. The National Population Council has conducted in-depth research into selection mechanisms and overseas qualification recognition. Over 120 submissions from individuals and organisations, commenting in detail on the Committee's recommendations, have been received. Substantial media and public comment was monitored and analysed. During September, I met with my State and Territory counterparts to discuss the report and visited the capital city of each State and Territory to hear at first hand the views of ethnic, employer, union, legal, welfare, church, refugee and population group interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report has aroused considerable interest and controversy. This is not surprising for an issue such as immigration, which touches the lives of every Australian, whether born here or not. Its central message-that immigration should be for all Australians-has received wide support. Its proposals for a sharper economic focus to and through immigration have aroused apprehension among ethnic communities, while being welcomed by commercial and other sectors of the wider community. Some query why we have immigration at all and others call for substantial program increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Two areas of the report have aroused particular controversy: multiculturalism and citizenship. The issue of multiculturalism was not central to the report and the subsequent attention afforded to it did not add to the community's understanding of the issue and was at some cost to informed debate on the core immigration issues in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Multicultural policies play no part in immigrant selection. As a quite separate domestic policy, multiculturalism seeks to ensure that those born in Australia and those who migrated to Australia, are equally accorded their rights. Multiculturalism also asks of migrants that they bring a commitment to Australia and to its basic values and institutions which attracted them to migrate. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of our non-discriminatory immigration policy we live in an ethnically diverse community; we are already, in a descriptive sense, a multicultural nation. Multiculturalism is premised on an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia. It embraces basic issues of individual expression, social justice and economic efficiency. We need multicultural policies precisely in order to ensure that insecurity, disharmony, injustice and inefficiency do not disfigure our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to popular belief, the Committee did not reject the concept of multiculturalism. While reporting widespread mistrust and misunderstanding of the term, it endorsed the need for such a policy. The Government is aware of the misapprehension and confusion within the community. We are currently developing the national agenda for a multicultural Australian order to give sharper definition and direction to the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee rightly identified citizenship as the ultimate expression of commitment to Australia, but in the Government's view proposed an inappropriate strategy for encouraging its acquisition. A commitment stems from deeply felt sentiments. It cannot be developed by coercion or punitive measures which deny benefits to non-citizens. The Government totally rejects such an approach, which denies the contribution that non-citizen residents make to Australia through working and through rearing their families here. The announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of a Year of Citizenship which he launched on 30 September is a positive approach. Initiatives for the year are designed to enhance the concept of citizenship, to encourage all who are eligible to acquire it to do so, and to promote awareness of and pride in what being an Australian citizen means. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of the Committee's work, the Government made it clear that the principle of non-discrimination was not negotiable. Indeed, the Committee found that anti-Asian sentiment was not a major issue. It is regrettable that the Opposition sought to exploit this issue in the course of the Government's deliberations on the Committee's report. It is, however, a telling indictment that members of its own ranks crossed the floor of both Houses to vote with the Government on our successful motion earlier this year to uphold the principle of non-discrimination. We are already feeling the effects of the so-called Asian Migration debate and our overseas posts have reported considerable concern resulting from it. In order to ensure continued interest in programs such as the business migration program, where Asia has been our largest source, there needs to be convincing reassurance that Asians are welcome in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government remains resolutely committed to the principle of an immigration policy which does not discriminate on the basis of race or ethnic origin. The events since the release of the Committee's report have reinforced that view. In that context I now state that Government believes that a return to a bipartisan policy is in the interests of all Australians. I take this opportunity to go on the record and say to the Opposition that, should it accept the invitation I now extend to it to return to a bipartisan, non-discriminatory policy, the Government, for its part, will applaud and in no way seek to take political advantage of the fact that it has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to the Government's response to the Committee's report, I want to emphasise some important general points about Australia's immigration program. Firstly, the size and composition of the program reflect quite diverse, but equally important economic, social and humanitarian goals. Certain elements of the program have been specifically tailored to our economic development requirements-for example, to attract business migrants with entrepreneurial skills-and to supply young, skilled, educated and readily employable migrants. Some of these migrants are selected for specific skills in short supply, the demand for which cannot immediately be met by domestic training and education programs. These economic migrants, through the skills, capital and expertise they bring, actually create more jobs than they take and make a very positive contribution to our economic development. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of social goals, Australia supports the concept of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. The practice of permitting husband, wife and dependent children to co-reside is also fundamental and underlies our policy approach to the reunion of immediate family members. </PARA>
<PARA> In humanitarian terms, Australia is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights and the 1951 Convention on the States of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. As a responsible member of the international community, Australia has an unrivalled record of finding solutions for refugees from around the world and has accepted significant numbers of refugees for resettlement: 470,000 in the last 40 years; 175,000 since 1975. Our efforts have contributed to the welfare of individual refugees, enhanced our high international standing and strengthened our participation in regional and international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing this context in mind I now turn to the Government's response to the Committee's report. The Committee made 73 separate recommendations for immigration including a totally new package of legislation. The number and complexity of the recommendations would require a lengthy and detailed treatment which time does not permit. I propose instead to inform honourable senators of the broad approach and principles which underpin the Government's decisions. The Government has adopted many of the themes of the Committee's report and the substance of many of its recommendations. In some areas the Government supports the underlying concepts, although the approach adopted differs in detail. In others, the Government's response diverges significantly from the Committee's proposals. In essence, many of its recommendations confirm current policy directions. </PARA>
<PARA> No response on the complex question of immigration will ever receive wholesale and unquestioning support from all quarters of the Australian community, nor are there any magic answers to meet the wishes of all. The Government's task is to find the right balance to achieve outcomes in the national interest and to accord due weight to the competing and often conflicting demands placed upon immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Committee's message that immigration is for all Australians and that it should be in the national interest. Consistent with these principles, we have decided on a responsible immigration policy for the future which will balance economic, social and humanitarian imperatives and which will assist in national planning through immigration research and management. Central to this process is the Government's acceptance of the Committee's recommendations for the establishment of a Bureau of Immigration Research, to which I will return later, and Immigration Outlook Conference, which will enable us in future to indicate longer term forecasts, and to foster national understanding of immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the migration program for the next two to three years is to be maintained at 140,000 places, comprising three main streams: 71,000 in a family category, 54,000 in an economic category and 14,000 in a humanitarian category, plus a special eligibility category of 1,000 places. While both the level and composition of the program are broadly consistent with the Committee's proposals, its recommendation for 150,000 places is not regarded as justified. The Committee also recommended alignment of the Government's grant of resident status policies for temporary residents wishing to stay in Australia and its migration policies. These are significantly aligned at present but total alignment would create undesirable consequences, particularly for management of the program. Instead, the Government will continue to account for grant of resident status approvals within the total planned migration program but will assign them to their respective program elements. The Government has also not accepted the Committee's recommendation that there be a single `open category'; this is seen as too blunt an instrument for achieving program objectives. Instead, the economic and family categories will respectively comprise elements of the present independent and concessional category, each with a different points test to manage the demand for migration places. This will ensure that the overall program level set by the Government is not exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has adopted a new points system which will be used to select certain categories of migrant from 1 July 1989. The points system was developed by a National Population Council Working Party under the chairmanship of Glen Withers, Professor of Economics at Latrobe University. It followed extensive research and model simulation, together with consultation with peak employer, employee and community groups, and took the Committee's proposed system as the basis for development. Under the points system, independent applicants will be numerically assessed against an employability factor which awards points for skill, age and language, while extended family migrants will be separately assessed on the basis of points awarded for employability-excluding language-and attributes of the sponsor. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the family migration category, a `balance of family' criterion will apply from tomorrow to parents applying for migration overseas and for the grant of resident status within Australia. Parents with more children in Australia than in any single country or at least an equal number in Australia as overseas, will be selected as close family. Those not meeting this criterion may be considered under the points system for extended family. In recognition of rising welfare costs the Government has revised the basis of the assurance of support which currently is sought from sponsors of parents who are within 10 years of retiring age. These will continue to be required, but from April 1989 their provisions will extend to the recovery of unemployment benefit paid to the person assured and the assurance itself will have effect for five years. In future, assurances of support will be sought for all parents selected under the balance of family criterion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to examine ways of accepting some family reunion applicants who are currently ineligible because of social or medical factors which could result in their becoming a charge on the Australian community. A parliamentary committee will be invited to consider the existing scheme of assurances of support by sponsors and whether a bonding system for such people can be established under which the Government's social and medical costs will be met. At the same time, the committee will be asked to examine the feasibility of giving bonus points under the points test for applicants who undertake to meet their own English language training costs. The committee will be requested to report by the end of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic migration category will contain as base elements the current business migration program and people nominated by Australian employers under tripartite arrangements negotiated between the Government, unions and employers. The current occupational shares system will remain in place for the short term but will be brought together with the independent subcategory in a points tested component designed to maximise economic benefits. These changes will apply from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90 the non-refugee base elements of the program will be close family migrants-that is, spouses, dependent children and parents selected under the balance of family-in the family category and skilled and business migrants in the economic category. Program allocations for these elements will respond to demand for places. The two points tested components of the program will be independently adjusted up or down according to demand in their respective base elements and will be managed under a floating pass mark which the Committee recommended to ensure that the best are selected and that numbers in the overall program are not exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to refugee issues is strong and will be maintained. Given the sensitivity and the complexity of refugee policy, I wish to announce that a senior position within my Department has been assigned to coordinate our response to refugee and international immigration matters. The establishment of this position will give further impetus to the Government's ability to focus on and respond to international developments and to people in distressing circumstances. It will also ensure that our official consultations with other governments and interested Australian community groups are satisfactorily conducted and will enhance our ability to achieve our international immigration and humanitarian objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> While noting that resettlement is the least preferred response to refugee situations, the Committee rightly regarded our refugee and humanitarian response as exemplary and a vital part of our overall immigration program. The humanitarian category will be held at its current program level of 14,000, comprising at 12,500 program for those selected overseas under our refugee and special humanitarian programs and those in Australia granted resident status on refugee and humanitarian grounds, together with a contingency reserve of 1,500 places. This response is a realistic reflection of need and is similar to the program recommended by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's commitment to finding a durable solution to the 13-year Indo-Chinese outflow has been demonstrated in a number of ways, but probably in no better way than our resettlement program. We will not disengage from Indo-Chinese refugee resettlement, as the Committee suggested, but we will continue to monitor closely the outflow from Indo-China and respond to changes as and when they occur. We believe that a range of measures and responses is required over and above resettlement, including improved migration programs from the countries of Indo-China and international initiatives to address the continuing outflow. The Government is not attracted to the Committee's proposal that program places be set aside for agency sponsorships, but recognises that churches and voluntary agencies are often well placed to identify specific cases in grave emergency situations. We will examine sympathetically how such agencies can contribute to the speedy handling of such emergency cases and to their support after arrival in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee proposed, in its model Bill, that an independent refugee commissioner be appointed to hear onshore refugee claims in place of the determination of refugee status procedure which was introduced in 1978. The Government has decided instead to retain the existing determination procedure and enhance it by allocating additional staff and resources to improve and accelerate processing. The model Bill also proposes the abolition of the Migration Act provision which deems arrivals who have been refused entry, not to have entered Australia. The Government believes that this would create a certain pull factor and could place Australia in the situation faced in some countries where there are tens of thousands of onshore refugee claimants. The Government has not been able to accept this proposal. Arrangements will also be made for people determined ineligible to remain, but who are without valid national travel documents, to be issued documentation to facilitate their departure. </PARA>
<PARA> While a minor special eligibility category is to be retained for the migration program, its existing provisions for the permanent entry of self-supporting retirees will be abolished and no new applications will be accepted from tomorrow. Provision will, however, exist for temporary entry for extended stay for retirees who are in a sound financial position. This approach will avoid demands on our health and social welfare systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee rightly identified problems which exist in procedures for assessing and recognising overseas qualifications. This issue was raised almost without exception at every consultation I held throughout Australia during September. The problems have been with us for decades and despite some recent improvements and a number of current initiatives, many of them remain. The National Population Council Working Party on overseas qualifications under the chairmanship of Professor Stephen Castles, Director of the Centre for Multicultural Studies at Wollongong University, has identified inefficiencies in wasted skills and labour market rigidities, and inequities in inconsistent administration and outcomes. Taking into account current Commonwealth and State initiatives it has proposed a model for the recognition of overseas qualifications. The Government values the contribution made by the National Population Council Working Party. The Prime Minister has already announced that the issue of overseas qualifications has recently been referred to the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet. The model developed by the National Population Council, together with other related inquiries on the issue of skill accreditation in Australia generally, has been added to the Committee's agenda for micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made a number of recommendations concerning settlement services starting from the basis that my Department should shift priority to those who have been in Australia for less than two years. Rather than being prescriptive on a time frame, the Government has agreed, in this spirit, that my Department should concentrate its settlement programs on the needs-based provision of services for immigrants, with the aim of helping them to integrate into the Australian community and to reach their potential. Consistent with this aim my Department will refocus its settlement activities. It will pay particular attention to the priority needs of annual migration intakes according to the individual's circumstances. Support for women immigrants will continue to be given priority, as one of the areas critical to the settlement process. My Department's strategic role in settlement will be clarified by phasing out duplication with other agencies where it exists, having regard to their access and equity commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the Bureau of Immigration Research which the Committee recommended be established. The Committee was critical of the lack of policy-oriented research and statistical information available to the Government and of the capacity to produce it. I do not necessarily accept that as a criticism of my Department, where priority is given to its very high volume visa activity. The Government, however, readily accepts the need that the Committee has identified and is to establish a Bureau early next year. The Bureau will have an important role in providing facts to combat ignorance and misinformation about immigration and in improving the climate in which immigration issues are considered. The Bureau will have the resources for predominantly commissioned research and will undertake some in-house research. It will undertake formal and informal consultations, including the immigration outlook conferences proposed by the Committee. It will also make an important contribution in facilitating policy development elsewhere in my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Committee's proposals for new immigration legislation. The Migration Act 1958 has come under increasing scrutiny and attack in recent years. Proposals for reform have been put forward by both the Administrative Review Council and the former Human Rights Commission. The Committee proposed that the Act be replaced by a new piece of legislation and produced a model Bill for this purpose. The model Bill is an innovative and bold piece of work; it would make changes of the most fundamental kind to existing migration law. But, as bold and innovative pieces of work often do, it carries with it certain risks and uncertainties as to costs, policy, and management of the program. The Government has decided that rather than trying to address all the legislative, procedural and administrative changes in one move, the better course is to pursue reform of the existing Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations incrementally. This has the added advantage of allowing changes to commence more quickly. Key amendments will be introduced in the autumn session of Parliament, and will lay the groundwork for accountable and consistent decision-making in the immigration jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The major change will be the phased introduction of a statutory two-tier system of review of immigration decisions. The first tier will be statutory review by officers within my Department but independent of the primary decision-making areas. It will not be subject to direction as to how it should handle individual cases. The second tier of review will be formed by substantially restructuring the immigration review panels. This restructured body will be empowered by legislation to consider cases on their merits and to make the final decision. It will be independent in its operations and procedurally informal. It will have as its members persons whose background and credentials will ensure high quality, professional decision-making. The body will be represented in all States and Territories. Fees will be charged for each tier of review, with a lower fee at the first tier. </PARA>
<PARA> Different classes of decision will be progressively referred to this new review system. Concurrently, the wide discretions within the Migration Act for these classes of decision will be replaced by closely defined entitlements and restrictions set out in regulations. The Secretary to my Department will be designated as the decision-maker for most classes of decision, although I shall retain the power to determine several classes of decision, notably those involving the deportation of criminals, security matters and refugee determinations. I shall also retain a general statutory power to override any decision of the review panel which, while consistent with the regulations, acts against the interests of the applicant. I shall exercise this power where I believe it to be in the community's interest and where this occurs I shall table my reasons in the Parliament. These changes are designed to ensure that decision-making is fair, open and accountable, and not susceptible to casual and unrecorded intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's model bill provided for many of the enforcement functions relating to prohibited non-citizens to be carried out through the State law enforcement and justice systems. This so-called criminalisation of enforcement has been widely opposed as harsh and out of step with criminal law policy. It places a potentially heavy burden on the State police, court and penal systems. While the Government will not be taking this course, it is concerned to ensure that the deportation process is both just and effective. The introduction of the new review system will ensure that a person's claims to stay in Australia, temporarily or permanently, will be rigorously and impartially tested. If those claims are found to be wanting, then departure should follow. If the person fails to depart within the time provided, deportation will be mandatory. I have highlighted certain areas where the Government's decisions do not precisely follow the model bill. I would emphasise, however, that while the Bill will not be introduced into Parliament in its recommended form, its ideas and innovations will be drawn upon in reforming the Migration Act 1958. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decisions on the Committee's report, which I have announced, represent an equitable and balanced approach to immigration. We have maintained our commitment to social and humanitarian needs in a responsible and responsive manner, while at the same time addressing an economic focus to immigration. The program size and composition for the immediate future is a realistic response to competing demands and priorities. It will continue to provide for the reunion of close family. Extended family will be specifically recognised through a separate points-tested category within the family migration stream. The economic focus will be achieved by enhanced selection mechanisms under tripartite negotiated arrangements between government, unions and employers, and under a revised points system for independent applicants stressing economic qualities. Humanitarian programs have been maintained and procedures for the determination of refugee status in Australia are to be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Improved management of the program under the Committee's recommended floating pass mark concept will ensure that annual intakes are kept within planning figures and do not simply respond to demand. The recommended new Bureau of Immigration Research and, under its aegis, the Immigration Outlook Conferences will improve the climate of immigration by providing necessary research and information for better planning and understanding. The Migration Act and Regulations will be incrementally overhauled to ensure, as the Committee sought, fairer, clearer and more accountable decision-making in my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures I have announced comprise major reforms to immigration policy and administration. The reforms, together, are the most significant innovations in Australia's immigration programs to have occurred during the last two decades. The Government has attempted to strike a responsible balance between the economic, social and humanitarian objectives of the immigration program. We have designed a system of program management which will deliver planned outcomes. Through our emphasis on a strong research base, we will bring immigration into the mainstream of economic and social planning. Nor have we lost sight of the individual. The changes to the legislative framework will ensure that the administration is demonstrably open, consistent and equitable. The principle of equity is fundamental to this entire package. It is about giving all people a fair chance within the context of a program that serves the interest of the Australian people. I am also glad to announce that these reforms are expected to result in a net reduction in Commonwealth expenditure in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank honourable senators for their patience in hearing me today on this important package of decisions by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the following paper: Government response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies-Ministerial Statement, 8 December 1988.

<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Settlement Facilitation</PARA>
<PARA>11. That the Department adopt as an objective a shift in priority in settlement services to those who have been here for less than two years, and that the needs of immigrants who have been here for more than two years become the responsibility of other service delivery and appropriate policy departments: Social Security; Health and Community Services; Employment, Education and Training; Industry, Technology and Commerce; and Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted as a basis of allocating priorities to services but not as a rigid formula. </PARA>
<PARA>12. That in public spending, priority be given to four areas which the Committee identifies as critical to the settlement process: English, skills recognition and bridging and upgrading, support for women immigrants and interpreting and translation services. </PARA>

<PARA>Accepted as a concept for further development. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible Citizenship Declaration. </PARA>
<PARA>* I undertake to respect the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>* I will endeavour to inform myself about the principles upon which these laws, and related institutions, are based. </PARA>
<PARA>* I undertake to accept and respect the institutions and principles of Australian society, including parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality of women, universal education. </PARA>
<PARA>* I undertake to accept and respect the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin which informs the laws and institutions of Australian society and the immigration policy of Australia and under which I have taken up residence in Australia and thereby become entitled to Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA>21. That a group of eminent Australians should be appointed to advise on further ways of making citizenship a more meaningful commitment to Australia and of encouraging its acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA>Overtaken by the Year of Citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA>Time Frame and Program Size</PARA>
<PARA>22. That planning be in the form of a 10 year rolling forecast. At any one time there should be a fixed intake for the first three years with an indicative intake for the following seven years. </PARA>
<PARA>To be examined further in the light of detailed research through the Bureau of Immigration Research. </PARA>
<PARA>23. That there be a program of 150 000 per annum for 1988/89 until 1990/91. Until such time as the changes to immigration categories and selection have been effected, the program should be in pro rata terms. The first full year at 150 000 would be 1989/90, and this would be maintained for 1990/91. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted-Program size 140,000. </PARA>
<PARA>24. That until the Government assesses that it has the program right, more substantial increases not be contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted. The program size should be determined by Government priorities in light of the Bureau's research on Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA>25. That the immigration program in the period to June 1991 be carefully monitored to assess whether the introduction of perspective planning, improved selection (that is the emphasis on youth, skill and entrepreneurship), and better targeted post-arrival services, has increased the impact of immigration on economic growth and improved Australia's capacity to absorb immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>26. That the composition of the program for the three years from 1988/89 (beginning in January 1989) to 1990/91 be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: each category should be argued separately on its merits in light of the Bureau's research on Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) Category A (Family Immigration) to remain self-determining, but likely to increase to about 40 000;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Category B (Refugee/Humanitarian) be increased to 15 000;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Category C (Open Category) to form the balance of around 95 000. </PARA>
<PARA>Immigration Categories</PARA>
<PARA>27. That the immigration program consist of three categories: Family Immigration, Refugee and Humanitarian, and Open. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: program to consist of three broad streams: Family, Humanitarian and Economic, broken down into more specific categories, and a separate, minor special eligibility stream. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Immigration</PARA>
<PARA>28. (1) That the Family Immigration Category be expanded to cover grandparents of Australian citizens, 55 years of age or older, (2) that the job offer requirement be dropped for parents 55 years of age and over, (3) and that parents under 55 be processed in Open category. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted. The approach to be pursued allows processing of all parents in the Family stream where the balance of children are in Australia; parents outside this class may only apply under other categories. No special provision for grandparents beyond existing criteria is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>Refugee and Humanitarian Program</PARA>
<PARA>29. That the Refugee and Humanitarian category remain as a humanitarian provision to respond to resettlement demands which arise overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted subject to change in terminology from `demands' to `needs'. </PARA>
<PARA>30. That two distinct but complementary programs be established for refugee and humanitarian cases. One would be for people identified by the Australian Government as needing resettlement on humanitarian grounds. The other would be for humanitarian cases identified by community organisations with international agency affiliation and with the capacity to verify such cases and provide settlement support. In all cases, it will remain the responsibility of the Australian Government to decide who will be accepted for resettlement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted but Government recognises that such organisations are often well placed to identify cases in grave, emergency situations and will examine how they can contribute to this part of the Government's program. </PARA>
<PARA>31. That in 1988/89 the government and community programs number a total of 15 000 places, in which there should be a flexible contingency figure. The size of the program should be reviewed after one year and the number of places reduced if the program has not been filled. The Government should pay the travel costs to Australia of a total of 7 500 people, of which up to 1 000 places would be available for agency sponsorship. This latter arrangement should also be reviewed at an agreed time. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted. Program set at 14,000 including 1,500 contingency reserve and grant of resident status on refugee and humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>32. That funding go to those in most humanitarian need, namely refugees and in-country rescue cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>33. That the existing Community Refugee Settlement Scheme be expanded to offer support to all refugees including agency sponsored cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted (Program was expanded in 1988-89 Budget). </PARA>
<PARA>34. That from 1988/89 Australia gradually disengage itself from Indochinese resettlement, in line with the decreasing outflow and diminishing number of refugees from Indochina and in the context of positive strategies for solutions to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: approach to Indochinese resettlement should take account of current international developments including a proposed International Conference on Indochinese refugees and Australia's significantly increased Vietnamese Family Reunion Program. </PARA>
<PARA>35. That the allocations in the refugee program for refugees from different regions in the world cease to be regarded as quotas or targets. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>36. That Australia work in multilateral forums towards a separate program of measures, including a legal framework, from the orderly and humane management of mass movements of undocumented migrants. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>Open Category</PARA>
<PARA>37. That selection for the Open category be based on three fundamental elements:</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted as the mechanism for managing demand in the points tested component of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) self-assessment, or the assessment by applicants of their prospects prior to formal assessment, a process which should help to eliminate frivolous applications;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) scoring on the basis of factors which reflect Australia's economic, demographic, social and cultural interests;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an order of merit approach which, by taking the top scorers from around the world, selects only enough to meet the proposed size of the program, replacing the present system whereby everyone who scores 70 points or more is eligible. </PARA>
<PARA>38. That a task force comprising relevant government, employer and union representatives be established to facilitate the introduction of negotiated arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted as an issue for consideration by the Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>39. That the renewal of negotiated arrangements continue to be conditional on the relevant industry demonstrating a record of commitment to training and retraining. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>40. That seven groups of factors should form the basis of the selection procedure in the following order of priority: labour market skills; entrepreneurship and special talents; age; language capacity including English as an employability factor; kinship in Australia; links with Australia; attributes of spouse. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted in full: alternative points assessment developed by the National Population Council. </PARA>
<PARA>41. That tripartite negotiated arrangements (government, employers, trade unions) be central to the allocation of points to different skills under the labour market skills factor. They should largely determine where the skill shortages are and which skills should receive the highest points. These negotiated arrangements should supersede the existing OSS and ENS sub-categories. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: a separate ENS category to be maintained while the existing OSS category is to be aligned with the new Independent category. </PARA>
<PARA>42. That the contribution of people with entrepreneurial skills to Australia's economic development be recognised by awarding a significant number of points for entrepreneurship, including a component on capital transfer insofar as it relates to a business venture. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: a separate Business Migration category to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>43. That for business immigrants the grant of Australian citizenship be contingent on provision of proof of a business venture having been set up. </PARA>
<PARA>Feasibility of proposal to be further considered. </PARA>
<PARA>44. That an effective monitoring and auditing system be established to cover both the investment of funds by business immigrants and the activities of accredited business immigration agents. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted and in place. </PARA>
<PARA>45. That a greater emphasis be placed on youth in the Immigration program, not only because of the demographic argument, but also because of the dynamism and innovation which youthful immigrants can bring to this country. The actual points allocation for age should be determined on the basis of which age groups have the most impact in reducing the median age of the immigrant intake while maximising skill levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part: points for age reflect maximum potential contribution to the economy over working life. </PARA>
<PARA>46. That applicants be able to score on the language factor either by having a knowledge of English, by being bilingual or multilingual or by being proficient in a language of national importance, for example the language of a major trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: language of national significance not adopted in points test; language test not adopted for the extended family category. </PARA>
<PARA>47. That the kinship factor give more points to siblings, adult children, nieces and nephews, parents and grandparents of Australian citizens, and fewer points to more distant relatives. No point on this factor should be allocated to applicants whose kin in Australia are not Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part: narrower band of kin and different scale of points adopted; sponsorship not limited to Citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>48. That an adjustment be made to the score of applicants on the basis of skills and other relevant attributes of spouses for example, by the allocation of bonus points. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>49. That the highest weightings go to the skills and entrepreneurship factors. People covered by negotiated arrangements should be given maximum points on the skills factor and this should ensure their selection provided they score adequately on the age and language factors. The weightings for entrepreneurship/special talents should be sufficiently high to facilitate the entry of business immigrants and the exceptionally talented, once their eligibility has been established. The age factor should receive the next highest weighting so as to deliver a low median age in the Open category. Language capacity should have the next highest weighting, close in importance to the age factor. The order of priority of the remaining factors, which are of lesser importance than above, should be kinship, other links with Australia, and attributes of spouses. The latter three factors must be weighted to support the broad objectives of the Open category. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: alternative points system adopted on basis of advice of National Population Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Health</PARA>
<PARA>50. That infectious diseases continue to be taken as a basis for excluding immigrants but that applicants with disabilities be assessed in the light of economic and family circumstances and taking account of the public health costs involved in their care and treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>Settlement Assessment</PARA>
<PARA>51. That the settlement assessment be dropped for all immigration categories. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part: application of settlement assessment to be narrowed. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligibility for Sponsorship</PARA>
<PARA>52. That entitlement to sponsor immigration, including through the kinship factor in the Open category, be limited to Australian citizens, except in instances where those being sponsored are spouses, dependent children or refugee/humanitarian cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted but Australian citizenship of sponsor is reflected in increased points. </PARA>
<PARA>Nexus between Temporary and Permanent Stay</PARA>
<PARA>53. That the criteria whereby people temporarily in Australia are assessed for permanent residence be the same as for immigration applicants overseas. Accordingly, the practice of granting resident status to people temporarily in Australia (change of status) should be discontinued, but applications within all entry categories should be accepted from people while in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: Grant of Residence Status to continue as a limited provision in defined circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>54. That people applying in Australia under the Open category not be permitted to extend their visas pending decisions and not have access to review rights. Sponsors would be entitled to seek review. Anyone who is illegally in Australia by unauthorised stay beyond the expiry of a visa, or by illegal entry, should forfeit the right to apply for immigration while here or be automatically rejected if they have already applied. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: consequential on response to R53. </PARA>
<PARA>55. That existing entry provisions for special needs relationships be expanded to cover cases of emotional inter-dependency between an overseas applicant and an Australian citizen, currently dealt with by the grant of resident status provisions. this should include widowed in-laws of Australian citizens (but only those people formerly married to brothers, sisters or adult children of their Australian sponsors) who have young children, and are without family or other means of emotional support in the home country. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: consequential on response to R53. </PARA>
<PARA>56. To deal with temporary residents equitably, that</PARA>
<PARA> (i) spouses and children accompanying parents be permitted to work;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) where the head of the family and/or spouses or children are working and thus paying taxes, the members of the immediate family accompanying parents to Australia should have the same access to education as other Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) Accepted and in place</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>57. That early steps be taken to protect the integrity of the total immigration program where it might be compromised by the unintended consequences of other government programs, for example by certain schemes for temporary entrants such as students. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Australia and New Zealand: Immigration Policies</PARA>
<PARA>58. That in the longer term, steps be taken to align Australian and New Zealand and Immigration policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted in this form. </PARA>
<PARA>A Professional Immigration Service</PARA>
<PARA>59. That the Department recruit a greater mix of highly qualified staff, including demographers, economists, psychologists, socialogists, statisticians, lawyers, political scientists and business graduates. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>60. That proficiency in a language or languages other than English should be emphasised in the appointment of officers to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>61. That there be continued and enhanced commitment at all levels of the Department including Regional Offices to the EEO Program, and to close monitoring of its progress. Indicative numerical targets would be set for representation of women and people of non-English speaking background in key positions in the Department, while ensuring that the merit system continues to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted to the extent this is consistent with current Government practice. </PARA>
<PARA>62. That further efforts be made to increase the representation of women in the immigration service overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>63. That the objective of a new approach to the service should be a more professional, more integrated immigration service, from the enquiry counters at Regional Offices, to the operations of our posts overseas, and the provision of policy advice to government. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>64. That there be established an independent Minister's Committee on immigration with a substantive role in policy formulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: The restructured National Population Council should be able to meet the intent of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>65. That the proposed Minister's Committee on Immigration be able to draw on a well-resourced research capability through a new and independent body to be called the Bureau of Immigration Research. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Consulting and Planning</PARA>
<PARA>66. That every two years there should be an Immigration Outlook Conference, supported by professional papers, with the first conference to be held in last 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Keeping the Community Informed</PARA>
<PARA>67. That an integrated coherent approach to public education be undertaken to dispel community misconceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Distribution of Staff Overseas</PARA>
<PARA>68. That the distribution of staff overseas be related to the number of immigration decisions likely to be made at each overseas post after applicants have been pre-selected. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part: other factors such as level of visitor visa issue also relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>69. That there be a comprehensive review of recruitment, training and supervision of locally engaged staff, but that where possible and appropriate, Australians living and travelling abroad be recruited as immigration aides of Australian overseas missions. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part although review not required. </PARA>
<PARA>70. That in any information materials prepared for clients, the Department ensure that due emphasis is placed on the position and rights of women in Australia and on Australia's commitment to giving women the same access and opportunity as men to the immigration process. Where possible, women immigration officers should be available to counsel women applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Immigration Fees</PARA>
<PARA>71. (1) That fees continue to be applied to immigration services and (2) be extended to fund services such as the provision of information kits to facilitate self-selection. (3) Fees should be waived in cases of extreme hardship. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, perhaps at the same time I may seek leave to table and possibly incorporate in Hansard a statement-`Statement on Criminal Deportations by Senator the Honourable Robert Ray, Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT ON CRIMINAL DEPORTATIONS BY SENATOR THE HON. ROBERT RAY, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 May 1983 the Hon. Stewart West, the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, outlined to the Parliament the Government's policy on the deportation of criminal non-citizens who are residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In that statement the Minister noted that persons who have been ordered deported pursuant to Section 12 of the Migration Act 1958 have a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The Minister further noted that, if the Government decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendations of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in the Parliament, at the first opportunity, a statement of reasons for so deciding. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that policy was laid down, it has become apparent that a Minister's decision not to follow the recommendation of the AAT is itself reviewable by judicial review. Most affected persons are availing themselves of this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>In that light, I have some diffidence about displaying in full detail the background to and circumstances of persons who are ordered deported in spite of an AAT recommendation to revoke the deportation order. Apart from the adverse and unpleasant publicity which would fall on the convicted person, his or her family, and, possibly, the victim and the victim's family, Parliamentary debate on the issues could conflict with the person's rights of judicial review in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, I am conscious that my decisions in these matters should be held to account. While obviously such cases usually involve a decision to deport against AAT advice, occasionally the converse applies and an offender is permitted to stay despite AAT endorsement for deportation. In either case I have decided to table from time to time a precis of the cases which are the subject of AAT recommendations, together with a copy of the Statement of Reasons for not following its recommendations, where available. Statements of Reasons are prepared for the Federal Court pursuant to S.13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and would thus not be prejudicial to its hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>Members who are interested in further details may refer to AAT decisions and, where relevant, can follow the Federal Court hearings. While the Federal Court is not entitled to canvass whether the Minister's decision was the preferable one, judicial review provides an opportunity for the affected person to air all of the details of the case, if he or she so desires. In practice, the Court tends to hear in considerable detail the criminal history of the appellant in addition to the outcome of the AAT hearing and other related issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The details I am tabling concern ten persons for whom the AAT has recommended the deportation orders be revoked. Since 1985, my predecessors have disagreed with the recommendation in respect of eight persons. I have disagreed in respect of two. As at 16 November 1988, seven of these persons appealed to the Federal Court; two were dismissed by consent; three are awaiting judgement; two others were dismissed by the Federal Court, the first by a single judge and the second by a single judge and then subsequently by the Full Bench of the Federal Court. Special leave to appeal to the High Court against the Federal Court decision has been sought by this applicant. In the other three cases in which the AAT's recommendations for revocation of the order were not accepted, no appeal has been made to the Federal Court. One applicant left voluntarily. The time to lodge an appeal to the Federal Court has not expired in respect of the other two applicants. </PARA>
<PARA>In all cases the decision to reject the AAT's recommendation was made only after the fullest consideration of the facts and of the personal circumstances of the offenders and their families. At the same time, Ministers have had to recognise their responsibility to the Parliament and to the Australian public to protect Australia from the possibility of further criminal behaviour or to exclude from Australia those non-citizens who have seriously abused the privilege of residence accorded to them by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I can appreciate that the Administrative Appeal Tribunal's consideration might not always have embraced the same issues as those which the Government and Parliament must have in mind. The Tribunal might also not place the same emphasis on issues as the Government does. And, occasionally, the Tribunal appears to have misunderstood the Government's policy and intent to which it must have regard. It is hoped that this statement will provide it with a better understanding of the Government's aims in this matter. In general, I would hope that, consistent with the Government policy, the Tribunal gives weight to the need to protect Australian society from non-citizen residents convicted of serious or multiple offences. Conversely, the Government considers that it could give a reduced weighting to the views of the offender and that person's family and to the adverse consequences for them of deportation. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have indicated I do not intend to detail the individual claims in these cases. The decisions taken by the Minister do not, however, take account of any facts in addition to those considered by the Tribunal; the decisions do involve a difference of judgement. I emphasise that I regard the Minister's responsibilities under the Migration Act very seriously and where there has been disagreement with the AAT it has not been taken lightly; where there has been only a slight difference in emphasis the AAT's recommendations have been accepted. Only in cases where it was judged by my predecessors that serious adverse consequences could arise as a result of revocation of deportation orders, have the AAT's recommendations been set aside. The particular areas of differences between the Government's decisions and the AAT's recommendations are now provided to allow a better understanding of the Government's view on the deportation of criminal non-citizen residents. </PARA>
<PARA>One area of particular concern arises in cases involving trafficking in illicit drugs. As the Parliament knows, the Government is currently conducting a vigorous anti-drugs campaign. It would thus be invidious if non-citizen residents who seek to profit from the import or supply of drugs, whether that profit is motivated by their own need for illicit drugs or otherwise to support their lifestyle, were likely to be allowed to remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We should not forget that Australia every day receives hundreds of migration applications from worthy applicants who cannot be accepted because Australia has the ability to absorb only a limited number of people. It would be irrational to refuse them while allowing others to remain who continue the serious abuse of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important both as a deterrent and to protect Australian society that it is clearly understood that a person convicted of drug trafficking, which puts at risk the very lives of young Australians, has no place in our society. It should also be clearly understood that a conviction for drug trafficking by a non-citizen residing in Australia may carry with it an order for deportation. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the AAT has given on some occasions less weight than I or my predecessors believe justified in considering the total criminal history of a person who is liable for deportation. Clearly, a person who has been previously warned about the liability for deportation and, notwithstanding that warning, commits a further deportable offence, should expect that the warning be given serious weight in consideration of his case. A person whose reputation is based on an array of convictions against the Australian society should usually be judged in the light of that past behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>Occasionally the AAT also gives more weight than I or previous Ministers believe is justified to the perceived difficulties concerning the person's country of origin. The conditions existing in the person's country of origin are sometimes relevant to the consideration of deportation issues but would not often be a factor which outweighed all others. Indeed, civil or military hostilities are more likely to affect the timing of a deportation rather than the decision to deport, and judgements about job opportunities and the overall environment which might face a deported person are not persuasive, however compassionately viewed, especially when compared to the need to remove a person who has offended against the Australian community or who is a risk to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>If the individual in question is likely to be singled out by the overseas government for discriminatory treatment, that would be a relevant factor. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to use this opportunity to ensure that the multicultural nature of Australia's society is not used in some way to suggest that differences in cultural background should result in differing applications of the law. This view, some have suggested, has gained currency in some lower Courts in Australia, but I note that appellate Courts have not agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>In one of the cases on which I have reported today there was an implication or a suggestion by the AAT that the offender's cultural background was relevant to the crime committed and to consideration of the deportation. Certainly our multicultural society encourages all citizens to practise their cultures and to pursue their ideals. But such practice must fall within a commitment to Australia and an adherence to the basic values and institutions which form the essence of Australia. Migrants are attracted to Australia because all are equal before the law; because we enjoy a democracy; because we are pluralistic. It is not multiculturalism to bring one's religious dispute or sectarian differences to Australia or to carry views which reduce the value we place on human life. Nor do those contrary values provide an excuse to persons who offend against the Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>A sensitive issue which also arises from time to time concerns the liability for deportation of an adult who arrives in Australia as a minor. Clearly, the time a person has been in Australia and the degree of connection persons have with their country of origin are relevant factors in coming to a decision on whether or not a non-citizen resident ought to be deported when the person has offended against the laws of Australian society. The view has occasionally been expressed that persons who have migrated to Australia when they were minors ought never be deported. This is not consistent with the legislation or Parliaments intentions. I share concerns about the desirability of deportation in these cases but in many we are dealing with an offender who embarked on a life of crime as a child and who pursues that life into adolescence or adulthood. Where there is a pattern of criminal behaviour indicating a likelihood that the person will commit further serious crime, I believe a decision to deport must seriously be entertained. </PARA>
<PARA>Another issue which has arisen is the time at which it is most appropriate to consider criminal deportation cases. Where feasible, a decision should be made as soon as possible after sentencing. It should desirably allow any AAT and Federal Court review to be completed before the expiry of the custodial portion of the sentence actually to be served. Occasionally, however, a person seeks a decision to be made at an earlier time to enable, for example, the chance of lower security imprisonment or to make other plans concerning the future. Where such individual requests are received and a decision given by the Government, the AAT should not lightly or generally recommend that the Government reconsider cases at a subsequent date. </PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken in these terms in order that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal can better understand the government's concerns. While it is not valid to apply policy to individual cases inflexibly, I am confident that this will allow the AAT a better appreciation of the reasons which have caused Ministers to reject recommendations on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>My continuing overriding concern is that the Australian community should be given the best possible protection from non-citizens whose criminal behaviour in the past indicates a concern about their behaviour and the impact of this behaviour on the Australian community. A sensible and rational appreciation of these issues will lead to a clearer understanding of the Government's attitude and, in particular, a clear warning to criminal non-citizens about their prospects of remaining in Australia in the future. </PARA>

<PARA>SUMMARY OF RECENT CASES IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL (AAT) HAS RECOMMENDED REVOCATION OF DEPORTATION ORDERS</PARA>
<PARA>CASE `A'</PARA>
<PARA>A 44 year old male who migrated to Australia in 1962. Convicted in Sydney in 1969 of 4 counts of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on each (he set a fire in a block of flats in Bondi as a result of which 4 people died). He was released on licence on 8 April 1983 and on 10 December 1983 he `maliciously set fire to a motor vehicle' for which, on 16 February 1984, he was convicted and sentenced to 18 months hard labour. A single man, who described himself as a ` loner', he had no significant social ties with the community here despite over 24 years residence (most of which he had spent in prison) although he maintained some ties with his mother and step-father in Mullaway, NSW. Minister's delegate, when ordering deportation on 19 August 1986, was satisfied that subject was `a persistent serious offender who represents a real threat to the community'. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the deportation order, the AAT on 10 June 1987, found that there was substantial reasons for discounting the risk of recidivism including psychiatric reports which demonstrated a confidence in the subject's prospects of rehabilitation; the AAT was satisfied subject was not a pyromaniac; the acts of arson for which subject was convicted were precipitated by circumstances which were most unlikely to recur; and subject's deportation would not only adversely affect him but also his mother with whom the AAT accepted he had a very strong tie. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister's decision not to accept the Tribunal's recommendation is currently before the Federal Court. </PARA>

<PARA>SECTION 13</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA>I, MICHAEL JEROME YOUNG, Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, having received a request dated 3 November 1987 from the Legal Aid Commission of NSW, for a statement of reasons for my decision of 9 October 1987 not to revoke the deportation order signed on 19 August 1986 in respect of (``the applicant''), make the following statement setting out my findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and giving the reasons for my decision. </PARA>
<PARA>1. On 19 August 1986 the Ministerial delegate, Mr A. C. Harris, signed an order pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act that the applicant be deported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On 10 June 1987 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by Deputy President R. C. Jennings QC, decided to recommend to me that the deportation order in relation to the applicant be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>3. In making my decision of 9 October 1987, I adopted the findings on material questions of fact made by Deputy President Jennings, as set out in his reasons for decision of 10 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The Government's criminal deportation policy, tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4. </PARA>
<PARA>``It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>5. While I accept the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, in some important respects I did not accept the Tribunal's characterisation of the weight to be given to them in the exercise of my discretion. In particular, my view of the case differed from that of the Tribunal in relation to the Tribunal's findings as to the question of recidivism. </PARA>
<PARA>6. On the issue of recidivism the Tribunal commented that, given the nature of the applicant's offences: ``one might be excused for inferring that the risk of recidivism was significant and that the applicant may well have a serious problem involving the use of fire''. The Tribunal concluded, however, that ``the detailed sworn evidence tells a different story and advances substantial reasons for discounting the risks of recidivism''. </PARA>
<PARA>7. In concluding that the risk of recidivism should be discounted the Tribunal took into account the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA> the efforts made by the applicant to rehabilitate himself;</PARA>
<PARA> the strength of the applicant's commitment to his mother;</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant's resolve not to drink;</PARA>
<PARA> the fact the applicant will be released on licence;</PARA>
<PARA> the likely influence of the Release on Licence Board. </PARA>
<PARA>8. The Tribunal found that the applicant had made significant efforts to rehabilitate himself. In reaching this conclusion the Tribunal had before it material which had not been before my delegate when the deportation order was signed. This was reports of Senior Psychologist Helen Toner dated 21 February 1986 and 7 November 1986, probation and parole reports dated 3 June and 7 August 1986. I accepted that the applicant had made significant efforts to rehabilitate himself. </PARA>
<PARA>9. The Tribunal found that the applicant had a strong commitment to his mother and this was a factor motivating him to do well. I accepted this finding of fact. </PARA>
<PARA>10. The Tribunal found that the applicant had resolved not to drink and that this had been tested on day releases. I accepted that the applicant had resolved not to drink, I noted, however, that the criminal offences in respect of which the applicant was convicted in 1968 and 1983 both involved alcohol. Further, the applicant's resolution not to drink had not been tested outside the reasonably strict controls of the prison work program. </PARA>
<PARA>11. The Tribunal found that the fact that the applicant will be released on licence will act as a strong deterrent to breach of conditions of release. I accepted this finding of fact. I noted, however, that when the applicant was released in 1983 he was released on licence. He was, however, within a period of less than a year, charged with malicious damage to property. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The Tribunal found that the Release on Licence Board had available to it the services of skilled persons who are conscious of the need to provide continued support for persons released on licence. The Tribunal found also that the Release on Licence Board had not begun to function in 1983 when the applicant was previously released on licence. I accepted the above findings of fact. I noted, however, that there was no evidence that the Release on Licence Board would be able to provide anything more than general guidance to the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>13. In view of my findings on the above matters I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I agreed with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact, I took the view that the Tribunal gave excessive weight to the influence of the Release on Licence Board and the strength of the applicant's resolution not to drink when that had not been tested outside the reasonably strict controls of the prison work program. I took the view also that the Tribunal did not have sufficient regard to the fact that the applicant's second offence was committed while released on licence, the gravity of the applicant's offences and the interests of the Australian community which may be seriously harmed by allowing the applicant to remain a part of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>14. In making the above findings I had regard to:</PARA>

<PARA>CASE `B'</PARA>
<PARA>A 36 year old male who migrated to Australia in 1975. Convicted in Sydney in 1984 for supplying Indian hemp for which he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. He had prior convictions including, in 1982, supplying and possessing heroin (12 months imprisonment on each, non-parole period 6 months) and, in 1984, for possessing heroin (9 months imprisonment). He was separated with 2 children in the custody of his estranged wife in Queensland with whom he had no personal contact for more than 2 years. Minister's delegate signed a deportation order on 28 July 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the deportation order on 16 June 1987, the AAT indicated that subject's circumstances were such that they would not normally make a sufficiently strong case to warrant reconsideration of the decision to deport. However, the AAT saw the fact that subject had provided valuable information to the police over some 5 years, that he had actively participated in the detection of crime and that his continuing services were considered to be very valuable because he had been responsible for much information leading to arrests for serious crime as the most important factor in the case, although there were other personal features of the case which weighed in favour of subject's continued residence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision not to accept the AAT's recommendation is currently before the Federal Court. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA>I, Michael Jerome Young, Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, having received a request dated 16 November 1987 from Messrs Low, Doherty &amp; Stratford, Solicitors, for a Statement of Reasons for my decision of 9 October 1987 not to revoke the deportation order dated 28 July 1986 in respect of (``the Applicant''), make the following statement setting out my findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence of other material on which those findings were based, and giving the reasons for my decision. </PARA>
<PARA>1. On 28 July 1986 the Ministerial Delegate, Mr A. C. Harris, signed an order pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act that the applicant be deported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On 16 June 1987 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by Deputy President R. C. Jennings Q.C., decided to recommend to me that the deportation order in respect of the applicant be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>3. In making my decision on 9 October 1987, I adopted the findings on material questions of fact made by Deputy President Jennings, as set out in his Reasons for Decision of 16 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The Government's Criminal Deportation Policy tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4:</PARA>
<PARA>``It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>5. The Tribunal had before it material which had not been before my delegate when the deportation order was signed. This was the written or sworn oral evidence of three NSW Police officers indicating that the applicant had actively assisted in the detection of crime and that his continuing services were considered to be very valuable because he had been responsible for much information leading to arrests for serious crime. However, the Tribunal was of the view, the final application of which I did not accept, that this material raised a strong argument for revoking the deportation order. </PARA>
<PARA>6. The Tribunal found, and I accepted, that `the potential for a material contribution to the community interest fortified as it is by a commendable record of service, previously never revealed, is the most important factor in this case. There are other personal features to which reference has already been made and which weigh in favour of his continued residence in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>7. On the issue of recidivism the Tribunal concluded: `Having regard to the circumstances surrounding the offences for which he was convicted, I consider there is still room for giving the benefit of the doubt so far as the risk of recidivism is concerned. There are good reasons for qualified optimism.' Furthermore ` . . . I am satisfied that this applicant has now made such a commitment to assisting the police in their efforts against crime that he would find it extremely difficult to involve himself in the kind of activity he professes to have strong motivation to arrest'. </PARA>
<PARA>8. In addition to the considerations outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, the Tribunal had regard to the other considerations that had been raised in the applicant's favour. The Tribunal was of the view, which I also accepted, that `although all (of these other considerations) have merit they would not, even if taken together, make a sufficiently strong case to warrant reconsideration of the deportation decision.'</PARA>
<PARA>9. I formed the view that the Tribunal gave determinative weight to the considerations outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7 above. I was not prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt concerning his prospects of rehabilitation and formed the view that they would be significantly enhanced if he were to dissociate himself from the drug scene. There would be a correspondingly greater risk of him becoming actively involved with drugs if he maintains such contact. However, if the applicant opts to dissociate himself from drug associates, his services as an informer would be reduced if not terminated. For this reason I did not accept the Tribunal's view of the weight that should be given to these two considerations as factors against ordering the applicant's deportation. </PARA>
<PARA>10. In addition, I gave significant weight to the fact that the applicant has no real ties in Australia and that therefore deportation was unlikely to cause him undue hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>11. In view of the conclusions I reached in regard to this case as referred to above, I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I would not disagree with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact, I took the view that the Tribunal wrongly gave determinative weight to the considerations outlined in paragraph 6 and 7 above and did not give sufficient weight to the applicant's lack of ties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>12. In making the above decision I had regard to a submission to me from Mr R Brown, Secretary, Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, together with the annexures thereto, viz:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Submission to the Deputy Secretary from Mr Z. Daszczyk, Entry Regulation Branch, dated 9 July 1986, and annexures. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `C'</PARA>
<PARA>A 25 year old, single male who migrated to Australia in 1970 with his parents when 8 years of age. Convicted in Sydney in 1984 of conspiracy to import heroin (14 years imprisonment), conspiracy to supply heroin (3 years imprisonment) and possession of heroin (3 counts, 3 years imprisonment on each, all to be served concurrently, with a minimum term of 5 years imprisonment). He had prior convictions including one in 1978 for rape (8 years imprisonment) following which he was warned on 26 October 1982 of the possibility of deportation if he re-offended. His family ties with Australia are strong-all members of his immediate family are resident here and are anxious to play a part in his attempted rehabilitation. When ordering deportation on 19 August 1986, the Minister's delegate recognised inter alia that this was a particularly difficult case but the fact that subject had previously been given the benefit of any doubt on the chances, which were judged to be fairly strong, that he would commit further crimes against the community of some gravity, was seen to override the factors against deportation. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the deportation order, on 24 June 1987 the AAT found that subject was a problem. He had a very bad criminal record and there was a risk that he may offend again. However, the AAT also reluctantly concluded that subject had become Australia's problem in that he had arrived in Australia as a child with his family and, in the opinion of the AAT, sending him back to a country which was now alien to him and his family could not be justified. The AAT also commented that if subject seriously offended again `it is to be hoped that notwithstanding parole boards and non-parole periods he will be placed in prison for a long time without compunction and without any early release'. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision not to accept the AAT's recommendation is currently before the Federal Court. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA>I, Michael Jerome Young, Minister of State for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, having received a request from Messrs Hanley Cameron and Goold, Solicitors, for a Statement of Reasons for my decision of 9 October 1987 not to revoke the Deportation Order signed 29 August 1986 in respect of (``the Applicant''), make the following statement setting out my findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and giving the reason for my decision. </PARA>
<PARA>1 On 29 August 1986 the Ministerial Delegate, Mr A C Harris, signed an order pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act that the applicant be deported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>2 On 24 June 1987 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by Deputy President C J Bannon Q.C., decided to recommend to me that the deportation order in respect of the applicant be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>3 In making my decision on 9 October 1987, I adopted the findings on material questions of fact made by Deputy President Bannon, as set out in his Reasons for Decision of 24 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>4 The Government's Criminal Deportation Policy, tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4:</PARA>
<PARA>`It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>5 I accepted generally the findings of fact made by the Tribunal; the Tribunal endorsed the summary (at paragraph 24 of the Deportation Submission) of the factors which in the Department's view favoured the deportation of the applicant. These included the seriousness of the applicant's offences, his apparent blatant disregard of the law and people of Australia in reoffending notwithstanding that he had been warned of the possibility of deportation and that there was a risk of recidivism which the community should not be expected to bear. </PARA>
<PARA>6 The Tribunal concluded that ``the applicant is a problem. He has a very bad criminal record and as such there is a risk that he may offend again. However, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the applicant has become Australia's problem. It was not by his conscious volition that he arrived in Australia at the age of 8 years.'' The Tribunal considered ``that the respondent's policy and the remarks of Brennan J in Salazar-Arbalaez were directed mainly at persons who arrived in Australia as adults and not as children aged 8 years. It appears to me that if Australia is prepared to accept migrants with children of tender years, it is not reasonable to deport to foreign lands, the child of an Australian citizen simply because that child is a criminal and is born in a foreign country and is not naturalised. It is neither compassionate nor in the best interests of Australia to deport children arriving as migrants because of later crimes.''</PARA>
<PARA>7 I took the view that the Tribunal in reaching its decision had given determinative weight to the fact that the applicant had arrived in Australia as a child with his family. I did not accept the Tribunal's view for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> the legislation does not exempt persons from liability to deportation pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act on the ground that the person was a child when he arrived as a migrant in Australia</PARA>
<PARA> the Government's Criminal Deportation Policy does not provide any exemption from deportation for offenders who initially arrived in Australia as children. That factor is of course a strong consideration militating against deportation, and in this case it was given substantial weight; it cannot, however, be of itself a determinative factor</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant committed offences against the law within 3 years of his arrival in Australia, when he was 11 years old</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant's father is a naturalised Australian citizen but the applicant is now 25 years of age. It would appear, from the evidence produced at interviews and at the AAT hearing, that for about 12 years he has not maintained normal families ties, although his family visited him in prison and would suffer hardship if he were deported. </PARA>
<PARA>8 In view of the conclusions I reached in regard to this case as referred to above, I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I would not disagree with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact, I took the view that the Tribunal wrongly gave determinative weight to the circumstance that the applicant had arrived in Australia as a child, and did not have sufficient regard to the interests of the Australian community, which may be seriously harmed by allowing the applicant to remain a part of the community. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `D'</PARA>
<PARA>A 33 year old male who migrated to Australia in 1977. He was convicted in Perth for possession of cannabis resin with intent to sell or supply for which he was given 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 1/2 years. He had prior convictions of a less serious nature including unlawful assault, disorderly conduct and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The factors militating against deportation were his strong ties with his siblings in Australia (parents deceased) and his intended on-going relationship with his Australian defacto spouse. On the other hand he had been convicted of entering into commerce with dealers of prohibited drugs; had made no appreciable contribution to the community and had previously be warned on 9 June 1981, in respect of another offence, that should he re-offend he could be deported-he apparently elected to disregard that warning which indicates a substantial risk of recidivism. Consideration was also given to the subject's ability and willingness to return to and live in his country of birth in 1978 when he married and for a time in 1980 when he was divorced. Minister's delegate signed deportation order on 19 August 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the deportation order on 29 January 1987, the AAT noted that the deportable offence did not involve ``hard'' drugs. The Tribunal assessed the risk of recidivism as low and, furthermore, believed he was capable of contributing to the Australian community by earning a living. He would experience hardship if forced to leave Australia because the vortex of his family life was in this country. The Tribunal assessed that, although he was involved in the trafficking of commercial dealing of cannabis, the involvement was not on a significantly large scale. </PARA>
<PARA>The subject applied to the Federal Court for a review of the decision to maintain deportation on the grounds of failure to observe rules of natural justice, improper exercise of power, error of law, failure to observe proper procedure and that the decision was otherwise contrary to law. On 9 February 1988 His Honour Mr Justice French dismissed the subject's application. </PARA>

<PARA>REASONS FOR MY DECISION</PARA>
<PARA>5. The Government's criminal deportation policy, tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4</PARA>
<PARA>``It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>While I accept the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, in some important respects I did not accept the Tribunal's characterisation of those facts or the weight to be given to them in the exercise of my discretion. In particular, my view of the case differed from the Tribunal's view in respect of the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA>Nature of Crime</PARA>
<PARA>6. The Tribunal found that the offence committed by the applicant did not involve ``hard'' drugs or dealing on a significantly large scale and accordingly the offence was not one which was included in the examples of serious offences given in paragraph 9 of the policy referred to above. While I accept this view I nevertheless considered the offence to be a serious one in view of the fact that the applicant was able to enter and was willing to enter commerce with dealers of prohibited drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recidivism</PARA>
<PARA>7. The Tribunal assessed the risk of recidivism by the applicant as ``low'' and categorised it as nothing other than an ever present risk. However in view of the applicant's prior criminal record and the warning which was given him on 9 June 1981 that should he re-offend he could be deported (which warning he apparently failed to heed) I considered the risk of recidivism to be serious. </PARA>
<PARA>Hardship to the Applicant</PARA>
<PARA>8. I accepted that the centre of the applicant's family life is in Australia. I also accepted that he has a stable and long-standing relationship with Miss M . However I gave weight to the fact that the applicant was willing and able to return to Lebanon in 1978 and 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Contribution to the Australian Community</PARA>
<PARA>9. The Tribunal found that the applicant had been willing and able to engage in regular employment both before his conviction and after his release from prison. The Tribunal concluded that ``there is no reason to doubt that he will be capable of contributing to the community by earning his way in it''. While I accepted the Tribunal's findings I considered that this did not amount to an appreciable contribution to the community and was unlikely to amount to an appreciable contribution in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>10. In view of the conclusions I reached in regard to this case as referred to above, I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I agreed with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact, I took the view that the Tribunal gave excessive weight to the hardship which would be suffered by the applicant and his family if he were deported, and did not have sufficient regard to the interests of the Australian community, which may be seriously harmed by allowing the applicant to remain a part of the community. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `E'</PARA>
<PARA>A 30 year old male who migrated to Australia in 1985 aged 26 years (he was previously in Australia between April 1981 to December 1982 as a visitor). He was convicted in Sydney in 1985 on 2 counts of supplying heroin and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. His family ties in Australia were strong-his parents, two siblings, fiancee and 3 year old son (by a previous relationship) were resident here. He was not aware of his son's surname nor address and therefore it has not been possible to ascertain the strength of the kinship bond. He has two brothers resident overseas. When ordering deportation on 7 October 1986 the Minister's delegate recognised that this was a difficult case but considered that he was active in the drug trade; the fact that the offences were committed a short time after arrival in Australia, his lack of contact with his son and, although hospitalised in August 1985 due to adverse consequences of drug use, he was soon after arrested on charges of using and supplying heroin-which would indicate that the risk of recidivism was high. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the deportation order on 13 April 1987 the AAT commented that the offence of supplying drugs was rightly categorised as serious, however following release from prison the subject had married his fiancee and had kept off drugs for some time. The AAT considered that hardship to the subject, his wife and family, if he was deported, outweighed the benefit to the community in his removal. Furthermore it was in the interests of the subject's natural son (whereabouts unknown) that he remain in Australia to meet his parental obligations. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA>I, MICHAEL JEROME YOUNG, Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, having received a request from Vickovich and Associates, Solicitors and Attorneys, for a statement of reasons for my decision of 9 October 1987 not to revoke the deportation order signed on 7 October 1986 in respect of (``the Applicant'') make the following statement setting out my findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and giving the reasons for my decision. </PARA>
<PARA>A. FINDINGS ON MATERIAL QUESTIONS OF FACT</PARA>
<PARA>1. On 7 October 1986, Ministerial delegate Mr Harris signed an order pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act 1958 that the Applicant be deported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On 13 April 1987 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by Deputy President C J Bannon QC decided to recommend to me that the deportation order in relation to the Applicant be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>3. In making my decision on 9 October 1987 not to revoke the deportation order, I adopted the findings on material questions of fact made by Deputy President Bannon QC, as set out in his reasons for decision. </PARA>
<PARA>B. EVIDENCE OR OTHER MATERIAL ON WHICH THE FINDINGS WERE BASED</PARA>
<PARA>4. In making the above findings I had regard to the submission to me from Mr R Brown, Secretary, Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs which I initialled on 9 October 1987 together with the annexures thereto, viz:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Submission to the Deputy Secretary from Mr Daszczyk, Acting Director, Enforcement 3 Section, dated 5 September 1986;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Statement of Reasons by the Deputy Secretary, Mr Harris dated 23 December 1986;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Decision and Reasons of the AAT (Deputy President Bannon QC) dated 13 April 1987;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Australia's Criminal Deportation Policy. </PARA>
<PARA>C. REASONS FOR MY DECISION</PARA>
<PARA>5. The Government's Criminal Deportation Policy, tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4:</PARA>
<PARA>``It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>6. While I accepted generally the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, in some important respects I did not accept the Tribunal's characterization of those facts or the weight to be given to them in the exercise of my discretion. </PARA>
<PARA>7. Apart from the assessment of recidivism and the prospect of assistance to a child, the AAT gave significant weight in favour of the Applicant, to circumstances arising since the deportation order was signed, for example his marriage and the hardship that would ensue for the Applicant's wife and family in the event of his deportation. In this regard I noted that the marriage took place after the liability to deportation had been brought to the Applicant's notice and I therefore took into account paragraph 10 of the Policy:</PARA>
<PARA>``Social ties developed after the liability for deportation arose, especially after the liability had been brought to the notice of the offender, can be discounted according to circumstances (eg Marriage, or the immigration to Australia of further family members).''</PARA>
<PARA>While it would be reasonable to accept that the Applicant, his wife and her family would suffer a degree of hardship in the event of deportation I considered that the weight given to such possible hardship by the Tribunal excessive given the policy outlined above. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Other factors I considered in favour of deportation were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Applicant committed a number of drug related offences including the deportable offences within 8 months of arrival in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> He was convicted of supply heroin and the possibility of recidivism, to whatever degree it exists is a risk that need not be borne by the Australian community;</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to his child by a previous relationship and the prospect of him paying for its maintenance, aside from the finding of the AAT that he was unsure of its whereabouts, if the Applicant was so inclined he could, of course remit funds to his son from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>10. In view of the conclusions I reached in regard to the case as referred to above, I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I did not disagree with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact I took the view that the Tribunal gave excessive weight to the hardship which the Applicant, his wife and her family would suffer if he were deported and did not have sufficient regard to the interests of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>11. I therefore decided, notwithstanding the findings and decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, not to revoke the deportation order. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `F'</PARA>
<PARA>A 25 year old male who migrated to Australia aged 10 in 1974 with his parents. Convicted in Perth in 1982 of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He had prior convictions of a less serious nature including unlawful assault, damage to property and aggravated assault. Factors militating against deportation were his strong ties with his immediate family in Australia and his intention to marry his fiancee, an Australian citizen. On the other hand the gravity of his offence and the risk of his committing further offences were seen to override the hardship that deportation might impose on him and his family. The Minister's delegate signed a deportation order on 26 August 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>On 20 February 1987 the AAT indicated that due to the seriousness of the crime, the factors for and against deportation were closely balanced. However, in view of the presence in Australia of his close-knit and supportive family; the fact that prospects of rehabilitation were better in the Australian community by his employment and association with sports, particularly drag racing-the AAT recommended that the deportation order be revoked. </PARA>

<PARA>SECTION 13</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA>I, MICHAEL JEROME YOUNG, Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, having received a request from the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia for a statement of reasons for my decision of 22 June 1987 not to revoke the deportation order signed on 26 August 1985 in respect of (``the applicant''), make the following statement setting out my findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and giving the reasons for my decision. </PARA>
<PARA>FINDINGS ON MATERIAL QUESTIONS OF FACT</PARA>
<PARA>1. On 26 August 1985 the then Ministerial delegate, Mr L. B. Woodward, signed an order pursuant to section 12 of the Migration Act that the applicant be deported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On 20 February 1987 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by Deputy President R. D. Nicholson, decided to recommend to me that the deportation order in relation to the applicant be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>3. In making my decision of 22 June 1987, I adopted the findings on material questions of fact made by Deputy President Nicholson, as set out in his reasons for decision of 20 February 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>EVIDENCE OR OTHER MATERIAL ON WHICH THE FINDINGS WERE BASED</PARA>
<PARA>In making the above findings I had regard to a submission to me from Mr A. C. Harris, Deputy Secretary, Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, dated 26 May 1987, together with the annexures thereto, viz:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Submission to the Deputy Secretary from Mr Daszczyk, Compliance Branch, dated 18 May 1987;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Submission to Mr L. Woodward, then Deputy Secretary, dated 26 August 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Submission to Mr Woodward from Mr R. A. Henderson, Director, Enforcement 3 Section dated 12 August 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Summing up to jury of His Honour Judge Olney dated 6 August 1982;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Prison report dated 21 March 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Report of interview with applicant conducted 27 September 1983, with attached testimonials;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Report of interview with applicant's parents conducted 21 October 1983, with attached letter from applicant's mother;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Statement of reasons pursuant to section 28 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act signed by Mr Woodward on 8 November 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) Decision and reasons of the AAT (Deputy President R. D. Nicholson) dated 20 February 1987;</PARA>
<PARA> (x) Departmental case note on the AAT decision dated 10 March 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>REASONS FOR MY DECISION</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's criminal deportation policy, tabled in Parliament on 4 May 1983, states at paragraph 4</PARA>
<PARA>``It is the policy of the Australian Government that recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances and only when strong evidence can be produced to justify the decision. Furthermore it is the policy of the government that, when the Minister decides to deport a person contrary to the recommendation of the Tribunal, the Minister will table in Parliament at the first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing so.''</PARA>
<PARA>While I accepted generally the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, in some important respects I did not accept the Tribunal's characterisation of those facts or the weight to be given to them in the exercise of my discretion. In particular, in terms of the factors examined by the Tribunal in its summation of the case at pages 24-35 of its reasons, my view of the case differed from the Tribunal's view in respect of the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA>Nature of Crime</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal found that ``the extreme seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant must weigh heavily in the administrative decision relating to his deportation. By its commission, the applicant may have placed himself among the class of persons whom Australia will not accept for entry.'' I took the view that the applicant had definitely placed himself within this class of persons. I took the view that, in exercising my discretion under section 12, I should make a choice on behalf of the Australian community to exclude from that community a person whose crime is so repugnant to the standards of that community that he should no longer be accepted as a part of it. </PARA>
<PARA>Recidivism</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse the view expressed by Davies J in Re Stone, and quoted by Deputy President Nicholson in this case, that ``even if the risk of recidivism is not high, the risk will strongly support deportation when recidivism, if it does occur, may cause great harm''. I took the view that, to justify a decision to revoke the deportation order in this case, the risk of recidivism would have to be shown by convincing evidence to be minimal. I noted the factors relied on by Counsel for the applicant as indicating that the risk of recidivism was low. On the question of recidivism, however, I took the view that the Tribunal's assessment that ``the applicant's crime of murder was a tragic and unusual product of grossly excessive intoxication, mistaken reaction to suspected aggression and youth'' was an inadequate description of the applicant's crime. As the evidence at the trial showed, the applicant committed a savage and sustained attack on a victim who, for a large part of the time, was unable to offer any resistance. In my view, the Tribunal placed undue emphasis on the ``unusual combination of factors and circumstances giving rise to the crime'' and not enough attention was paid to the violent propensities of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>Hardship to Australian Citizens</PARA>
<PARA>At the AAT hearing, the applicant's parents gave evidence that they were considering moving back to England if the applicant were deported; however they had reserved their decision pending the outcome of the AAT proceedings. The Tribunal found, and I accept, that great hardship would occur to the family, the parents of whom are Australian citizens, if they did decide to move to the United Kingdom. I took the view that the family's removal back to England was not a necessary result of my decision, but rather a decision for them to make. If the applicant were deported and his family remained in Australia, then both the applicant and his parents would still suffer considerable hardship; however the applicant is now of mature years and I did not regard this hardship as being of itself a compelling factor in favour of allowing the applicant to remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Hardship to Applicant</PARA>
<PARA>I noted the applicant's previous good work history and his apparent willingness to work in prison and to resume his working life upon release. I did not accept the Tribunal's conclusion as to the `unavailability of employment in England' although I accepted that the applicant may have difficulty in obtaining employment. However his previous good work history leads me to believe that he would indeed be able to obtain work in England. I accordingly gave less weight than did the Tribunal to the hardship which the applicant would suffer by reason of deportation. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the conclusions I reached in regard to this case as referred to above, I took the view that exceptional circumstances existed which justified me in departing from the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Although I would not disagree with the Tribunal in regard to its findings of fact, I took the view that the Tribunal gave excessive weight to the hardship which would be suffered by the applicant and his family if he were deported, and did not have sufficient regard to the interests of the Australian community, which may be seriously harmed by allowing the applicant to remain a part of the community. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `G'</PARA>
<PARA>A 53 year old male who migrated to Australia in 1972 with his wife and four children. He was convicted in Melbourne in 1978 for murder and wounding with intent to murder and sentenced to life and 15 years imprisonment respectively, to be served concurrently. The then Minister signed a deportation order on 26 October 1984 noting that subject was not at that time opposed to deportation, that his wife was prepared to accompany him and that their children, who were old enough to make their own decisions, tended to favour their father's deportation as they saw this as his best chance for release from prison. A request for review of the decision lodged in late 1987 indicated that the family no longer wished to leave Australia. After reconsideration the Minister's delegate decided, on 14 March 1988, that in view of the seriousness of the offences, the deportation should stand. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommending revocation of the order on 6 May the AAT found that because of subject's cultural background his crimes could be equated with crimes of passion. The Tribunal believed that people who commit such crimes are little deterred by the risk of deportation and that therefore little deterrent value would derive from subject's deportation. The AAT also found that the risk that the subject would commit similar offences in future was small and that deportation would cause hardship to the subject and members of his family. </PARA>

<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL DEPUTY PRESIDENT JENNINGS QC</PARA>
<PARA>SYDNEY</PARA>
<PARA>26 SEPTEMBER 1988</PARA>
<PARA>This case involved Tribunal consideration of a s.12 criminal deportation order. The Tribunal remitted the deportation decision under review to the Minister for reconsideration in accordance with a recommendation that the deportation order be revoked. The decision is significant in the weight given by the Tribunal to the risk of recidivism in an assessment of whether to recommend that the deportation order be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>2 On 11.3.88 a deportation order was signed in respect of a Maori New Zealander based on his conviction for possession of cannabis and his sentence to 2 1/2 years' imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>had been involved in an international operation in the illegal importation of cannabis valued at more than 6 million dollars. had been a permanent resident of Australia (Perth) for 2 years 1 month, when he committed the offence on 22.11.85. </PARA>
<PARA>3 The applicant had virtually no previous convictions, and he admitted to occasionally smoking cannabis. The Tribunal accepted that the applicant was a devoted husband and father and that his wife and children would return to New Zealand in the event of his deportation as the family were extremely close. The Tribunal also accepted that the applicant had a very good work history and offers of employment upon his release from prison. </PARA>
<PARA>4 The Tribunal indicated its view that the risk of recidivism was a factor of the utmost importance in any determination of whether an applicant should be deported pursuant to s.12. In determining whether was likely to re-offend the Tribunal considered:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) whether the circumstances in which the crime was committed were such that there was a reasonable possibility that he would not commit a similar crime;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether the evidence revealed any facts which reduced such a possibility to a fanciful one; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) whether explanation for his involvement in the crime was an acceptable one. </PARA>
<PARA>5 The Tribunal answered the first question in the negative and the remaining questions in the affirmative and concluded that the possibility that</PARA>
<PARA>would commit a further serious offence could be completely discounted. In this finding the Tribunal differed from the delegate who had found that the risk of recidivism could not be discounted. </PARA>

<PARA>This case involved an AAT consideration of the merits of a criminal deportation. The Deputy President recommended revocation of the the deportation order and remitted the matter to the Minister for reconsideration.</PARA>
<PARA>FACTS</PARA>
<PARA>2 The applicant, a British citizen, born in 1962, migrated to Australia, from Scotland with his parents, brothers and sisters in 1977. In 1985 he committed three offences involving armed robbery of a drug dealer (not reported to the police), a massage parlour and at a pinball parlour respectively. He was convicted, on his own plea and sentenced to 6 1/2 years imprisonment in respect of the latter 2 offences. The robberies arose as the result of a social association formed with persons who frequented a street known as the `alleyway', where the applicant had in 1985 set up is own spray painting and panel beating business. These persons introduced the applicant to marijuana and amphetamines and persuaded him to commit the robberies. At the time of the offence the applicant had been drinking and taking these drugs. In the latter 2 offences the applicant had entered the premises and like the co-accused, he carried a weapon and wore a disguise. </PARA>
<PARA>3 The applicant had prior convictions including driving while disqualified when his blood alcohol level exceeded .05%, unlawful assault, possessing a firearm without a licence and handling stolen goods. All prior offences were committed under the influence of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA>4 The applicant's fiancee told the Tribunal that she had left him because he had not given up drugs, as she had asked him to do. She indicated that she hoped the relationship would develop to the stage when they would marry. </PARA>
<PARA>THE DECISION</PARA>
<PARA>5 The Tribunal held that armed robbery was a very serious offence (even though no-one had been injured); the risk of recidivism was more than negligible because the applicant had an alcohol and drug problem and it was doubtful whether his fiancee or his family could influence him in the future, to give up these drugs; the Tribunal doubted whether the applicant would not re-offend although it considered that any future offences committed would not be of a serious, violent nature. </PARA>
<PARA>6 Against these factors the Tribunal weighed the hardship to the applicant and his family. The Tribunal held that the hardship which the applicant, his family and his fiancee would suffer if he were deported outweighed the other factors because he was still part of the family unit and because his surviving paternal grandparents in the UK would not be able to offer immediate assistance and accommodation. </PARA>

<PARA>CASE `J'</PARA>
<PARA>The applicant entered Australia as a visitor in 1972. He was granted permanent resident status in 1980. He was convicted of the cultivation and supply of cannabis in 1984 for which he was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. He was released on parole after 21 months. The Ministerial delegate signed a deportation order in August 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>On 8 October 1987, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal recommended that the deportation order be revoked. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal concluded that the best interests of Australia required revocation notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence. The Tribunal noted that the applicant was a homeless exile whose illegal residence had been condoned for a period of 15 years and that the trial judge had expressed confidence that the applicant would not reoffend. </PARA>
<PARA>There was little information before the Tribunal as to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime and the applicant's conduct since his release from prison. The Tribunal considered that better information about the circumstances of the crime and the likelihood of recidivism could be obtained when the trial of his co-accused was completed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal recommended that the applicant's deportation be reconsidered after further inquiries had been made. Departmental attempts to locate the applicant for the purposes of updating his circumstances since his release from detention were unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA>In deciding not to follow the recommendation of the Tribunal the Minister noted:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges of cultivation and supply of cannabis. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Tribunal could have sought further information during the hearing, this was not done. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The applicant attended the hearing and gave vive voce evidence to the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The circumstances of the crime, insofar as could be ascertained were fully set out in the Trial Judge's sentencing remarks. These remarks were before the Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, when the Privacy Bill was returned to us from the House of Representatives, I was pointing out the history of the legislation. Back in 1985 the Government had a sudden rush of blood to the head and that the only way to crack down on tax and social security cheats was to have an Australia Card. From that ensued a very prolonged parliamentary and public debate about the wisdom of presenting everybody with a national identification system complete with card with photograph magnetic strip on the back, talks about smart cards, computer chips and so on. In the long run, for a variety of reasons and more, I suspect through good luck than good management, that piece of legislation was defeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government in the meantime, had introduced a large number of amendments to legislation provisions, various guidelines, directives, administrative changes and so on which recouped large amounts of the money that had been lost prior to that through fraud and so on in both the tax and social security areas. Originally it was predicted that about $1,000m annually-was being lost to revenue through that form of fraud, cheating and so on. By the end of 1987 some $800m of that $1,000m of lost revenue had been recouped, as I said, by a range of means. That left $200m outstanding in the area of tax and social security fraud-less than 30 cents per week per Australian. Nevertheless, the Government decided that it needed to make moves to recoup this sum and chose to do it by introducing legislation to extend the use of the tax file number system. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time most of us who had opposed the Australia Card legislation and who could see very little difference between the Government's tax file number legislation and its Australia Card legislation other than the fact that there was no provision for a plastic card, photographs and one thing or another assumed that those people in this place who had opposed the Australia Card legislation would also oppose the tax file number legislation. That, however, was not to be. History shows that the Opposition undertook some sort of deal with the Government, the details of which are still not particularly clear, in order to bring this legislation into being. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the trade-offs dealt with the requirement to quote the tax file number. The Opposition persuaded the Government to introduce a half-baked sort of voluntariness to this. Under the original piece of legislation it would have been a breach of the law not to quote a tax file number to employers, banks, building societies and an assortment of individuals in the community. With the Opposition amendment, supported by the Government, we discovered that it would no longer be a breach of the law not to quote the tax file number but that a simple penalty would apply. One could not be taken to court as a consequence of not quoting the tax file number but one would face a pecuniary penalty. That penalty was to have over half one's income deducted in tax from dollar one-50.25c in the dollar to be deducted by way of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment effectively gave to the very wealthy in the community a voluntariness with regard to quoting their tax file number but the rest of us had no choice. We quoted it whether we liked it or not or we faced losing over half our salary in that pecuniary penalty. In any event there was very little the Australian Democrats could do about it. The deal had been done between the Opposition and the Government, and that was that. </PARA>
<PARA> But the second part of the deal related to the introduction of privacy legislation. The Opposition said, `We will support this tax file number legislation provided the Government minimises the intrusion into the community of that piece of legislation. Therefore, we want privacy legislation introduced that will protect individuals from malicious or incompetent people misusing the information, releasing it when they should not, distorting it, taking it out of context, and so on'. The Government produced, at the Opposition's request, a privacy Bill. Privacy legislation is something that the Democrats have been seeking since my colleagues came into this chamber in 1978. Australia has never had privacy legislation, unlike a number of other countries, and it sorely needs it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas that we all need protection from is the release of information about us from the private sector. This legislation does not cover that. It is a major flaw in the legislation. Senator Aulich, during the second reading debate, had a go at the Democrats for not raising the question of the private sector before. I suggest that the honourable senator look at our record; he will see that we introduced privacy legislation of our own. We have always argued that the private sector should be covered by privacy legislation. In any event an amendment we attempted to move in this regard was defeated by the Government and the Opposition on the grounds that they believed that the only threat to privacy in the community, apparently, is from the public sector, that is, from government departments and their agencies. I do not happen to share that belief, but that appears to be the attitude taken by the other parties in this place. So we lost that division. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there were a number of other very large loopholes in the privacy legislation that we and the Opposition set about closing. For example, we argued, would it not be right and proper that the information collected about individuals be required to be accurate? Would it not be appropriate that when information is sought and put into a file that it should be accurate? `Yes' said the Opposition. `No', said the Government, `it does not need to be accurate'. But we had the numbers on this side of the chamber and the amendment was passed. Then we said, `Wouldn't it be reasonable if people knew about the collection of the information and what was held on them?' The Opposition said it thought it was a good idea-at least it did at the time. The Government was not so enthusiastic but, again, we had the numbers on this side and a Democrat amendment relating to that was passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we said, `Shouldn't people know what the purposes for the collection of the information are?'. The Government had already included in the Bill that people should know what the main purpose was, but information is collected and used for a variety of purposes and, while one might be marginally more important than another-at least to the Government-the use of the information was not going to be limited to that. So we moved an amendment that said the individuals should be permitted the courtesy of knowing the purposes of the use of the information. The Government objected to that but the Opposition supported it, and that amendment went through. Then we said, `All right, the information has been collected; we have made it accurate; the subject knows what the information is: What about disclosure? What about storing the information? What about disposing of the information? What about amending the information? Isn't it reasonable to expect that those of us out here in the community, about whom information is being collected, should know to whom the Government is disclosing this information and why?'</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Opposition thought that this was reasonable. It supported the amendment and it went through. It has changed its mind. All of a sudden apparently the Opposition does not see the need for information to be accurate. It does not see any need for people to know the purposes for which the information is being collected. The Opposition does not believe that individuals need to know why the information is being disclosed or to whom. The Opposition has decided, two weeks after supporting these amendments, that it is not essential for people to know why this is all being done. I find that extraordinary. Here is a privacy Bill with holes in it that one could drive a fleet of trucks through. It is useless; it will not protect anybody's privacy. For a start, people will not know what information is being collected on them. People will not know about the spread of the legislation. How will they determine whether the information is accurate? They are being given no access to any important information at all about data stored on them. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not bad enough-namely, that the Opposition is reneging on its support of those amendments-something even more extraordinary is apparently about to happen. The Opposition is going to vote against its own amendments of two weeks ago. Senator Hill, for the Opposition, argued that the Bill was deficient in some ways. He argued that there was no capacity for an individual to commence an action for breach of privacy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that, in actual fact, a civil action in particular might be the most effective deterrent on Government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition said that people should be given the opportunity, if they ever found out that somebody had misused, leaked, distorted or destroyed information about them, to take an action for breach of privacy in the civil courts where one can get damages. They should not just have to go to the Privacy Commissioner who may award compensation. Everybody should be given the normal right that they have in other areas to take action for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has now decided apparently that this is not necessary and that we do not need to offer people that recourse to law any more-something which I would have thought Western democracies held dear. The Government has returned these amendments to us. Why? It has not done so for terribly convincing reasons. If we look at the schedule that the Government has brought before us that indicates why it does not want these amendments passed, we find an extraordinary litany of reasons. One is that it would be burdensome for the agencies. We cannot have the agencies doing anything that would burden them! We cannot allow people to be protected if it will get in the way of the agencies doing whatever else they do! It would be impractical for the agencies, says the Government. It would be difficult for the agencies, says the Government, and it would not be appropriate for the agencies to have to do these things, says the Government. The Opposition apparently also believes that it is inappropriate to have a piece of privacy legislation that actually protects people if--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is now debating the message from the House of Representatives desiring that the Committee not insist upon the amendments to the Privacy Bill made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. I do not intend to speak for long but I think I should put the position of the Opposition in its historical context, particularly in view of certain misrepresentations which I understand were made by someone on Canberra radio yesterday morning. Honourable senators will probably recall that when we considered the Government's Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill the Opposition set down a number of criteria which it said the Government would have to meet before the Opposition could support the Bill. One of the criteria relevant to this particular debate that we insisted on is that there be adequate privacy legislation introduced and passed by the Parliament to commence contemporaneously with the tax file number system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators may also recall that the Government produced for consideration by the Opposition a draft Bill which was provided, at that stage I think on a confidential basis, to the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown. The Opposition considered that draft Privacy Bill and found it to be fundamentally flawed, in our view, and requiring very significant alterations. There followed a series of meetings between Mr Brown on our side and I think Senator Tate on behalf of the Government, with the assistance of some of his departmental officials. The Opposition's concerns were put to the Government and they were virtually all acceded to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that I spend a moment to remind the Committee of how important were the requirements of the Opposition that were not included in the original Bill but which the Government, after negotiation, agreed to accept. The first flaw that we observed and required to be remedied concerned the duty of the Privacy Commissioner. The Bill provided that the Privacy Commissioner may issue guidelines on the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information. If those guidelines were not issued there would have been no rules for the privacy of tax file number information. We regarded that as a major defect in the Bill. We put that to the Government and said the `may' should be altered to `shall', placing a specific obligation upon the Privacy Commissioner, and the Government accepted that. So the resolution of our first major concern was accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second concern dealt with the guidelines for privacy. We were concerned that there were no actual guidelines or rules set down in the Bill for tax file number information. We said to the Government that before we could accept the Bill it must set out the terms and rules that the Government believed were adequate for maintaining the privacy of tax file number information. The Government responded by accepting that requirement of the Opposition. The Bill, as it presently stands before us, sets out the privacy guidelines in schedule 2. They are, of course, interim guidelines and will have effect until the Commissioner issues guidelines in due course under the terms of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area that we raised which is of concern to us was the exemption from information privacy principles on the ground of public interest. We noted that the Bill allowed agencies to apply to the Privacy Commissioner for an exemption from following principles on the ground of public interest. We said that that should be permitted only if it was in a form that could be disallowable by the Parliament. In other words, there had to be a parliamentary supervision of agencies calling upon this exemption of public interest. That requirement, after negotiations, was also accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area that we raised of concern dealt with complaints. We noted that the Bill provided for individuals to make complaints to the Privacy Commissioner against interferences but that no complaint could be made in the first six months of the operation of the Privacy Bill. That means that for the first six months agencies and tax file number recipients would be a law unto themselves. We said that this was unsatisfactory and that this limitation period should be removed. The Government's response was to accept our representations in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth area of concern that we put to the Government dealt with the Privacy Commissioner's powers to enter premises. We were concerned that when it related to entry of government premises he could do so only upon arrangements with the particular government agency. That is obviously flawed. I would not want to suggest that whilst arrangements were being made information might in some way disappear or otherwise be dealt with; nevertheless, justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. We said that that provision should be amended to give the Privacy Commissioner instant access to government agencies without any arrangement being made in advance. The Government's response again was to accept the Opposition's representations. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth area of concern that we put to the Government-I am going through these because Senator Haines said that she was not aware of what the Opposition had been able to extract from the Government in this matter-dealt with reports to the Parliament. We noted the inadequacy of the report provisions within the Bill and made representations that at least the major activities undertaken by the Privacy Commissioner should be included within the report; the Government again accepted our representations in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh area of concern to us that we raised with the Government was in relation to the commencement of the Acts. As I said, it was essential to us that both the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act and the Privacy Act commenced contemporaneously. We noted that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill was to come into operation when it received the royal assent, but that the Privacy Bill was not to come into operation until proclamation. Of course, there could therefore be a gap and that gap was unsatisfactory to us. The Government accepted our representation in that regard, so that both Bills now come into operation at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> So there were seven critical matters on which we required the Government to take remedial action and in all cases it accepted our submissions. There was an eighth one which the Government refused and that related to our belief that there should be a civil action for breach of privacy. That is still our view. We believe that there should be a civil action. Whilst acknowledging that there is a capacity for action in statutory form within the Bill and it does allow for compensation, nevertheless, we are of the view that a civil action would give greater flexibility and would be a real deterrent for government agencies in breaching the privacy principles. We are still of that view. It is never too late. We still call upon the Government to accept our view in that regard and improve--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines has spoken for ages. She should give me a chance. As I said, it is never too late. We still call upon the Government to improve this legislation further by accepting our view that a right of civil action for breach of privacy should be included within the legislation. Nevertheless, we made it public on 1 November 1988 that we regarded the Privacy Bill, in the form that had been agreed, with the seven alterations that the Government accepted, as being in a satisfactory form to be passed by the Parliament. That was our view. We made it public that we would support the Bill in that form. We said that we would, nevertheless, try to improve it even further in the Senate. But, as I have said, on 1 November 1988 we indicated that if we could get no further with the Government, we would nevertheless accept the Bill in that form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We think privacy legislation in this country is important. It is long overdue. It is now time that it be passed. When the Bill was debated in this place we took the opportunity to call for two further significant improvements to the Bill-which went beyond the agreement we had reached with the Government, but nevertheless, if one believes that legislation can be further improved, one should make the effort. One of those improvements concerned appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Under the Bill there was a right of appeal of the government agency when an order of compensation had been made but there was not a right for an individual to appeal to the AAT when an order of compensation had not been made. We were pleased that, in this place, the Government accepted our proposals to amend that provision. Therefore, we were able to extract from the Government one extra improvement to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one final matter on which we also sought agreement of the Government in this place but which, I accept, was not put to the Government in our previous negotiations. That was our view that in the case of representative actions there should also be the capacity to award compensation. The Government has not been prepared to accept our view in that regard. We are still of the opinion that the Bill could be improved by inclusion of such a provision but, as I have indicated, we do not regard it as vital to the passing of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation was before this chamber previously, we were prepared to accept a number of the Australian Democrats' amendments which were designed to strengthen further the privacy principles. Those we accepted on the last occasion we still believe would further improve this legislation. But, every time one reads a piece of proposed legislation, ways become apparent in which that proposed legislation can be further improved. We do not believe that that further strengthening of the principles, as we argued in this place on the last occasion, is critical to the passing of the Bill. We regard the Bill as being in a satisfactory form as it was at the time of introduction to this place, which was in the form that was agreed by the Opposition at the beginning of November 1988. I hope that that clarifies the position of the Opposition in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that this Bill is to pass into law. We are pleased that it has been substantially altered in accordance with the representations we made to the Government. Certainly on this side of the chamber we see it as a vastly improved piece of proposed legislation as a result of the representations we made, which were accepted by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I have ever heard such an extraordinary piece of rhetoric from anybody, including Senator Hill. Senator Hill has just got up here and pleaded with the Government to do something that the Opposition could do with its own vote shortly. He has just said, as he was reported in the newspapers this morning as saying, that he wants to make a final appeal to the Senate. In case you had not noticed it, Senator Hill, you are part of the Senate and your lot and our lot have the numbers in this place-on the rare occasions you are not voting with the Government and giving it the numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why is Senator Hill saying to the Government that he wants it to support Australian Democrats amendments which the Opposition supported two weeks ago and he wants the Government to support Opposition amendments which we supported two weeks ago, but the Opposition is not prepared to do it? I find it even more extraordinary that Senator Hill finished his plea by saying that he thinks the Bill is satisfactory anyway, even if it is not further amended. Somehow it is perfectly satisfactory to have a Bill that does not require the information collected to be accurate, and that does not require that the subjects about whom the information is collected know for what purposes the information is being collected! Somehow it is perfectly satisfactory to have a Bill that does not provide for any civil action for damages when somebody's privacy is breached. It is perfectly all right, apparently, to have a Bill that is drafted so that people do not have to be told what information about them is being disclosed and so that they have no control over that information. I find that astounding. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill said in the first 10 minutes of his speech that the Opposition had got seven critical matters included in the Government's original draft as part of the deal the Opposition did with the Government to support the tax file number legislation. There are eight equally critical matters left that the Opposition supported two weeks ago and that the Government is opposing and returning to us with the request that we not press these amendments. If they were sufficiently important two weeks ago, what in God's name has happened between now and then that has made them not important? Why is it suddenly not important that information collected on Senator Hill and me and 16 million other Australians not be accurate?</PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that information will be collated. It is bad enough if that information is accurate. But if it is inaccurate, if people do not know what has been collected, if they do not know why it has been collected or what is going to happen to the information after it has been collected, that is appalling. The Opposition thought it was sufficiently appalling two weeks ago to support our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet Senator Hill gets up here today and says that he is making one last plea to the Senate-of which he is part-to support the amendments but that the Opposition is not going to do it itself; it expects the Government to do it. This is just about as bizarre as Mr Howard stating last week that when in government, or if in government, the Opposition will repeal the tertiary tax, when that legislation has not passed the Senate yet. If Liberal Party senators do not like it, they can oppose it here and save Mr Howard the trouble of repealing it if he ever gets back into government. It is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> This chamber is a House of review, in case anybody else in here has forgotten that fact. It has long since stopped being a States House, despite what Opposition members choose to say when it suits their purpose. But it should still be a House of review. We are supposed to consider legislation on its merits. We are not supposed to say that if a Bill is a money Bill we will not touch it, but that we might repeal it when we get into government. We are not supposed to say `This Bill still has flaws, but please, Mr Government, will you do something about it because we do not feel able to?' No wonder the electorate does not want us to be paid anything. If a few more members of the public saw what happened in here they would probably share the Australian Labor Party's belief that we should get rid of the Senate. As far as I am concerned, the way this place behaves there is more reason than ever for a benevolent dictator-tempered with occasional assassinations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard Senator Hill say why, when the Opposition was able to support amendments which improved the Bill two weeks ago, it cannot do so now. The right to sue for damages is an integral part of our legal system. Why should it not apply to people who have been harmed in some way because a piece of legislation that has gone through this place, with the support of the Opposition, has allowed the collation and collection of information that has perhaps been misused by someone and damaged somebody else? Senator Hill has not indicated why he does not think information should be accurate. He has not indicated why this week, as distinct from the week before last, he thinks it is no longer important that people know which information is being disclosed and to whom. Senator Hill has not told us today, on behalf of the Liberal Party, why the Opposition is voting against its own amendments; why people should not have knowledge of the information collected about them; and why, when he has it in his power to make sure that the legislation is as leak-proof as possible, he is standing up here pleading with the Government to do it. We have the numbers. If Senator Hill has the brains, he will use them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to be drawn further into this discussion but, after the rubbish that I have just heard, answers are required on a couple of matters. The first rubbish concerned Senator Haines's suggestion that, under the principles, inaccurate information could be held legitimately. I draw her attention to the provisions as they exist. Principle 3, which deals with the solicitation of personal information generally, requires that all information collected be relevant to the purpose, up to date and complete. If Senator Haines wants to add another word, she can do so. In the previous debate we were prepared to accept the addition of another word, but what does the wording mean as it stands? What is meant by the requirement that the information be up to date and complete? What does `complete' mean? It is quite misleading to say that that legitimises the keeping of inaccurate information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Haines said that those about whom information is kept should be entitled to know the purposes. I draw her attention to principle 5, dealing with information relating to records kept by the record keeper. It states that if the record keeper has possession or control of a record that contains such information the main purposes for which that information is used must be given. There are good reasons to put it in those terms. We accepted that in the last debate. In many ways we would argue that the wording could be changed. If we had drafted this legislation we may have drafted the principles differently. But the person about whom information is kept is entitled, under these principles, to be made aware of the main purposes for which it is kept. Principle 11 sets out the limits on disclosure of personal information. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that Senator Haines read some of these principles before she contributes to the debate with such nonsense as we have heard this morning. Why are we not insisting on going further than what we regarded as satisfactory before? The reason is that we do not have the numbers in the other place and, if we did, the Bill would not become law. We believe that it is in the best interests of this nation that the Bill become law. We think it is long overdue, and we think it is about time the Australian Democrats supported it also. It would be in the best interests of the total Australian community to have adequate privacy legislation, and that is what this is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Hill that we amended a tax Bill yesterday and we do not have the numbers in the other place to make sure that the Government proceeds with that, either. We amend legislation all the time and we do not have the numbers in the House of Representatives. That does not stop us amending legislation. I remind Senator Hill of the comments that he made on information privacy principle No. 3 when we amended it on 22 November. After I moved an amendment to include the word `accurate' after `and is up to date and complete', Senator Tate pointed out that privacy principle 7 stated that certain information had to be relevant, up to date, complete and not misleading and that the world `accurate' was used in other places. He did not think that it was necessary, since information privacy principle 7 contained that word, that information privacy principle 3 should also contain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then Senator Hill got to his feet. His opening words were:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate has convinced me-</PARA>
<PARA>I thought, `Oh, blast, there goes that amendment. Senator Tate's erudition, rhetoric and positive charm oozing across the chamber have convinced Senator Hill not to support the Democrat amendment'. However, while I was thinking that, Senator Hill-of course, not aware that I was thinking it-kept on talking, which was quite appropriate. Had I been talking, it would have been rude of him, but I was only thinking. He finished his sentence with the words:</PARA>
<PARA>that `accurate' might as well be included in information privacy principle 3, because as he has already pointed out it is in principle 7, which is comforting, and that is in relation to alteration of records containing personal information and the obligation to ensure that deletions and additions are accurate. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, one asks why `up-to-date, complete and accurate' was not included in principle 3, relating to the solicitation of personal information generally. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 November Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can only presume that it was an oversight and it now looks as though we have the opportunity to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA>If it is rubbish for me today to suggest that information be accurate, why on 22 November did he consider it an oversight that needed to be corrected? As legislators, as people reviewing Government Bills and as people who have the capacity to improve where improvements are needed-notwithstanding that we will probably never run into a perfect Bill-we must ask ourselves what we are doing if we do not proceed down that road. If there is an oversight or a word that should be there is missing, surely it is our job to fix it up. It is not our job on this side to grovel around and ask the Government to do it when we know that the Government will not if it does not need to. If the Opposition is going to roll over and have its tummy tickled every time the Government woofs at it, of course the Government will not do anything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill was being very useful, Mr Chairman, but I take your wise words on board. Senator Hill pointed out that we did get one amendment through, which the Government supported. That amendment allows people to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), if they can afford to do so. It is rather like the amendment that the Opposition made to the tax file number legislation that said that if a person was wealthy enough he did not have to quote his number because he could wear the 52.5c in the dollar penalty. But the rest of the poor mugs out there do not have that choice. Not everybody can afford to appeal to the AAT when his privacy has been breached. It is an improvement, but it is not an improvement that will affect everybody. As that improvement was satisfactory, I maintain that the seven other amendments that were supported in this place on 22 November deserve the same support today, 8 December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberals cannot have changed their minds in such a short space of time! Then again, they can change their minds when they feel like it, I suppose.

That is what we are being paid to do. I say to Senator Hill: If we dig our heels in on these eight amendments I doubt very much that the Government will suffer the political backlash that would come from not proceeding with a piece of privacy legislation that actually protects privacy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is examining the schedule of amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. I would like to indicate publicly that a great deal of work has been done on this privacy legislation. The work of auditing what the Government was proposing has been achieved by a number of people, not least Senator Haines, Mr Neil Brown, the Opposition shadow Attorney-General, Senator Hill and others. They have worked strenuously to achieve a result which would give true protection to the privacy of individuals against the prying eye of a fairly all powerful government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Haines has said, it is the bureaucracy at work. They are quite reminiscent of the return to order paper we received in the Senate the week before last which gave reasons for certain legislation that had passed both Houses not being proclaimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the reasons set out by the House of Representatives for not agreeing to the Senate's amendments. Senate amendment No. 1 was to ensure that individuals from whom information was collected should be informed in writing of the purpose for which that information was collected. The response given by the Government is:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed requirement that the individual be informed in writing would be burdensome for agencies and of limited benefit to some individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government concedes, presumably, that it will be of benefit to many individuals. I would have thought that that was the reason the Senate adopted that amendment. I really believe that it is important for individuals not only to know generally the reasons for the collection of the information but also for these reasons to be given in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's response to the second amendment again the Public Service jargon comes out. Honourable senators will recall that the second amendment deals with the need to ensure that the material collected is up to date, complete and accurate. The Government's response to the second amendment is:</PARA>
<PARA>There are practical difficulties in imposing an obligation on agencies to check the accuracy of personal information at the time of collection. </PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the Government's response also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Privacy Principles 7 and 8 provide important privacy safeguards for individuals by requiring record-keepers to correct inaccuracies before making any use of information in records. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the Government not know about hackers? Does the Government not know of the possibility of information being accessed prior to the inaccuracies being discovered? Would it not be better for the inaccuracies not to have occurred in the first place? Surely that is the reason for the amendments that the Senate made to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to delay the Committee but I wish, finally, to turn to the next amendment. Senate amendment No. 3 provided that persons from whom the information is extracted should be informed of each purpose for which that information is used. The Government's response is simply:</PARA>
<PARA>Information privacy Principle 5 requires the record-keeper to provide information to enable any person to ascertain the main purposes for which that information is used. </PARA>
<PARA>The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Agencies may have a range of purposes for which personal information is used. It would be impractical to require agencies to set out all the possible purposes for which information held by an agency is used. </PARA>
<PARA>My question to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) is: Why would that be impractical? Surely the agencies know why they want that personal information. Surely they know how they want to use that information. Why should not the individuals involved be informed of the use to which that information will be put? I do not wish to delay the Committee but I really feel that at least that question should be answered. I reiterate, in looking at these Government responses, that it looks like the bureaucracy making the usual responses as to why it ought to have information and keep it to itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite proud of myself. I think Senator Hill and other honourable senators who will join in the vote which will be called on the amendments before the chamber also have reason to be pleased with the situation we are faced with. The formal motion before the chamber is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee does not insist upon the Amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. </PARA>
<PARA>This signals that, after many years in gestation, the Parliament has now reached a position where privacy legislation is to be passed in a way which will bind Commonwealth agencies in respect of the many millions of items of information they hold with regard to the Australian people. Further, in relation to tax file number information, the legislation will bind not only the agencies of government but the private sector as well. When one looks at the full scope of what is achieved in this legislation, one can say that it is a cause for some satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines made a quite exaggerated claim that one could drive a fleet of trucks through this legislation. </PARA>

Somebody as agile as Senator Haines on a little skateboard could possibly get through between a dot and a semicolon somewhere in this legislation. But it is quite absurd for her to say that a fleet of trucks could be driven through it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation has been achieved after many hours of arduous negotiation. Let us also take some satisfaction from the point that the legislation, though sponsored by the Government, cannot properly be characterised as Government legislation any more. It is truly the result of very constructive dialogue between the Government and the Opposition; between the Government and the staff of Australian Democrat senators, who also had some part to play in bringing matters of concern to the attention of the Government, which in many ways were accommodated; and between the Government and others. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is one of those rare occasions on which the substance of a Bill is not the first thought or the first option of the Government but is a very considerable improvement on the Bill which the Government first presented to the Parliament. That is shown most dramatically and graphically in the case of the tax file number information. The Government had thought initially that the guidelines that should govern the security and the storage of information, as well as the way in which it is handled and disclosed, should be devised by the Privacy Commission after using an advisory committee and drawing on extensive consultations and discussions within the community, particularly with the private sector which will be bound by those guidelines. It became perfectly obvious that the better way to go was for the Parliament itself to set down guidelines, which it has done in schedule 2 under the heading `Interim guidelines concerning the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information'. I will read the first of those guidelines, which more or less governs the whole. Guideline 1.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The tax file number is not to be used as a national identification system by whatever means. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill then spells out, over a number of pages, that objective by giving practical, specific guidelines, directions and indications as to how that goal or objective should be achieved and safeguarded. This is a very striking illustration of the fact that this legislation has been amended in a very useful and practical way to achieve the safeguarding of privacy which is the concern of all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not prove obdurate or obstinate. We did not want to hug the original form, or even the amended form, of the legislation to our bosom as though it were sacrosanct. As has been commented on, the House of Representatives accepted the amendment requested by the Senate that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) be given an extended role under which complainants who allege a breach of the information privacy principles (IPP) and who do not receive the compensation that they desire from the Privacy Commissioner, have a right to go to that body. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain amendments have not been accepted. I think it is important, because of the rhetoric that has been engaged in, to emphasise particularly the point that Senator Hill made. He said that information held by government agencies ought to be accurate. Of course it ought to be accurate. Difficulties can arise in ensuring the accuracy of information at the time of collection. The Bill recognises the practical difficulties in engaging in a detective type process to ensure absolutely that at the time of collection all the information that is gathered is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The information privacy principles should be read together. One should not read them in isolation as though each one were segmented, completely separate and apart from the others. For example, principle 7.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A record-keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall-it is mandatory-take such steps (if any), by way of making appropriate corrections, deletions and additions as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that the record:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is accurate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is, having regard to the purpose for which the information was collected or is to be used and to any purpose that is directly related to that purpose, relevant, up to date, complete and not misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>A very strict statutory obligation is placed on the record collector in that way. Information privacy principle 8 requires:</PARA>
<PARA>A record-keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall not use that information without taking such steps (if any) as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that, having regard to the purpose for which the information is proposed to be used, the information is accurate, up to date and complete. </PARA>
<PARA>I think one has an indication of the need to ensure that information held within the bureaucracy which is the basis on which decisions are made is accurate. The fear, misgiving or problem that Senator Haines spoke of should be put to rest. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters have been the subject of comment by Senator Haines. For example, she alleged during the debate that according to the Government and the Opposition it is perfectly all right that persons not know to whom information is disclosed. That must be a reference to information privacy principle 11 which imposes some limitations in respect of the knowledge which a person is required to have of information being disclosed to another agency. What is that exception? Section 1 (e) of principle 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA>the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>It is believed that, in those situations, the disclosure should not require the prior consent of the person concerned. The disclosure is noted on the file and that notation is available to the Privacy Commissioner who has the ability to audit all files at any time in any agency. Therefore, the privacy commissioner can check whether this particular exception is being abused. </PARA>
<PARA> One will recall, for example, that Mr Ian Temby, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, when speaking earlier this year about the need for exchanges of information by agencies in order to combat fraud on the Commonwealth, said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Accepting that there is a need to safeguard the handling of information which may be private, confidential and sensitive nevertheless it becomes an absurdity when fraud on the Commonwealth is facilitated by the enforced lack of communication between agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe there are occasions when the Australian Federal Police become aware, for example in an investigation of a drug importer, that a person is obviously deriving income from nefarious and illegal activities. In such cases it is quite proper that the Federal Police should transfer to the Australian Taxation Office the information that they hold in order that the public revenue be safeguarded quite apart from the responsibilities of the Federal Police in relation to the crime of importing drugs. Most people out in the community would see it as a very essential part of the exchange between government agencies that the opportunity, as in that instance to ensure that the public revenue is safeguarded, be taken. It would be absurd to require that the Federal Police inform the suspect, the target of its investigations, that in fact it wishes to transfer certain information to the Tax Office in relation to non-disclosure of revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as this particular matter has been raised as a matter of concern, there are very valid reasons for the exception being made. The appointment of the Privacy Commissioner-I think this is important; I place a lot of faith, as we must, in the person to be appointed as Privacy Commissioner-was agreed to in Cabinet yesterday. Of course, once the Governor-General is properly notified and makes the necessary arrangements in Executive Council, that appointment will be announced. The person concerned is the most important linchpin to the success of this legislation. If that person is of the view that this particular provision has been abused or is subject to some sort of corruption and contamination which takes it beyond what we in the Committee understood to be its scope of operation, I would hope and expect that the Privacy Commissioner in his report to the Parliament would make that abundantly clear and we would naturally be galvanised into action to safeguard privacy or to prevent the abuse which he disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the right to sue in the civil courts, it needs to be emphasised that we believe that-Senator Haines has spoken about the expense, for example, of going to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; I can assure her that it is even more expensive to go to court to enforce a particular right as she would be aware-this mode of operation which has been chosen under this legislation, whereby an approach can be made to the Privacy Commissioner, is more accessible, more attractive to people, less intimidating and will allow the Commissioner to undertake all the work that is necessary to find out the truth of the allegation about a perceived or alleged breach of the privacy principles. This would allow him to try to conciliate in the situation to bring about a remedying of the practice or an alteration of the mode of action of the agency such as is leading to that breach of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recall that access to the courts is not, in a sense, entirely excluded. Indeed, if one suspects that a breach of the privacy principles is occurring or one is aware that a breach is occurring, of course one can approach the Federal Court of Australia to get an injunction to prevent that breach. That ability to approach the courts in order to secure an injunction to prevent the breach from occurring or recurring is an important remedy. It will help, as I say, to give a multi- tiered approach, if you like. It will involve the courts. But the primary concern of people to get the Privacy Commissioner to remedy the situation in relation to their loss of a safeguard of their privacy is well provided for in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have legislation before us which represents a very fair-but not completely perfect-culmination of many weeks, many months and many years of endeavour by many people on all sides of the Parliament to give to the Australian people, finally, a statutory right to insist that their privacy be recognised and that safeguards be erected in so far as government agencies hold much information concerning them. In relation to tax file number information, that right has been extended to embrace the private sector in so far as it holds such information. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say finally that I appreciate very much the support that has been given by officials from the Department and by my private secretary, Dr Jim Gracie, in relation to the very arduous negotiations that have taken place which have produced this Bill which I believe deserves the support of the Committee, and therefore the motion which has been put also deserves the support of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now turned to a matter of great importance in the defence and veterans' community, namely, the long-awaited Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1988. This Bill is based on a proposal which came from the Opposition, so inevitably we feel obliged to support it. We welcome the fact that it has finally reached the Senate. It embraces our policy of privatisation by formalising the sale of the home loans portfolio to Westpac Banking Corporation. We in the Opposition believe that the transfer of responsibility to Westpac brings significant advantages for service men and women in particular. Of course, it also brings benefits to veterans. The first thing we welcome is the elimination of the 10-month waiting period. Mr Deputy President, as a former Navy man you would know only too well that the 10-month waiting period has been far too long. It has been government-induced and it has been held at that figure by successive governments. In some cases it is half a posting for a serviceman and on some occasions it is almost the entire time that a serviceman spends in one area. The elimination of that 10-month waiting period has brought very real financial benefit to service men and women because it has meant that they will no longer be reliant on expensive bridging finance. That is a matter which should be applauded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also welcome the fact that service men and women, if they choose, can go to a one-stop shop. They can get one mortgage from Westpac, which will mean that there is only one lot of establishment fees, and there is no need to go onto a second mortgage with high interest rates in order to meet the cost of financing a home. The Government continues to subsidise the first $25,000 of the interest payments on the loan. The remainder of the loan will be on first mortgage rates rather than second mortgage rates. That is a considerable improvement, in the opinion of the Opposition. I shall have more to say later about the amount of $25,000. This means that there may not need to be any second mortgage rate-in many cases there will not need to be-and there will be no establishment charges. </PARA>
<PARA> We also welcome the fact that the concept of portability has now been introduced to the scheme. This is something which we in the Opposition have long urged. We are very glad to see that the Government has taken this element and introduced it into the scheme. This full portability will apply to all loans granted after 9 December last year. It is something that recognises the lifestyle service men and women are forced to live, moving constantly around the country, and it is a benefit which suits that lifestyle. It was a nonsense to have a non-portable loan for those who have to move constantly, often at a moment's notice. It was a very real disincentive for servicemen to stay in the Services. When wives long for a home and their only way of achieving that is to get a once-off defence service home loan, then obviously the serviceman feels in many cases that to care for his wife properly he has to leave the Services and achieve that goal of a defence service home loan. That will no longer be necessary because the loan can be taken up, the house can be sold and the loan can be taken with the serviceman to a new home. That is a major step forward, in our opinion, in improving the conditions of service for defence personnel, and we all recognise how badly those conditions of service need to be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will help veterans who applied for loans after 9 December 1987. This is one area where we feel that veterans and servicemen who obtained their loans prior to 9 December 1987 are being unfairly treated. This new benefit which is being introduced will not apply to any loans granted prior to that time. It seems discriminatory, it seems quite unfair, and we urge the Government to reconsider this. I hope that it does not cause further disaffection in the Australian Defence Force because obviously, with morale problems being the way they are, we cannot afford any further disaffection there. But also I would have thought that if the Government had much understanding of the needs of retired people and the need to recognise changing lifestyles, it would have enabled older defence service home borrowers to move out of family homes which they had purchased years ago on a defence service home loan and move into smaller retirement housing by making the loan portable so that they could take the loan with them. I urge the Government to look at this. It seems to me it is a minimal cost but a major benefit to those veterans who are in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not disputing the advantages of the Bill but we do believe it is important to remember that there are some major long term problems which have still not been resolved. In that context it is worth while looking at the recommendations of the Cross report on Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force, which was tabled in the Parliament only three or four weeks ago, which addressed a number of matters which affect Defence Force personnel and the enormous wastage that we are suffering. The Cross report said that for the loan to be a valued condition of service its worth needed to be increased and indexed to inflation and that it was currently widely seen as either inadequate or, worse, in terms of wastage, scarcely worth having. </PARA>
<PARA> I was at the Army Tattoo on Monday night, which was washed out. I talked to some of the soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were receiving awards at a function at the Tattoo ground. Some of them were saying to me that they were not going to stay around in the forces, that they were concerned about the way things were going in the defence forces, and that the attraction that once was the defence service home loan was no longer good enough to keep them. That is very sad, because successive governments have recognised that the defence service home loan has been a condition of service which in the past-when it was more valuable-was a very real incentive to stay in the forces, to acquire the six years service which would entitle personnel to a loan. That has lost its attraction for the current service men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the loan was last increased in 1980, when it went up to $25,000. At that time it represented 55 per cent of the median purchase price of a home. But in the last eight years, as we all know only too well, the consumer price index (CPI) has risen 73 per cent. Now that loan is worth only $14,500 in real terms. In that time housing prices have escalated dramatically, and I just draw your attention, Mr Deputy President, to the percentage price escalation in the mainland capital cities. Sydney has gone up 119.5 per cent; Melbourne has gone up 145.1 per cent; Brisbane, 93.3 per cent; Adelaide, 118 per cent; Canberra, 131.3 per cent; and Perth, 62.5 per cent. So what was 55 per cent of the purchase price is now 27 per cent. That is what the loan is deemed to cover now. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly), in debate in the House of Representatives, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It has been rightly pointed out that one cannot buy a tent for $25,000 these days. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Minister has so clearly recognised the correctness of that statement, I should have thought that she would have been more effective in persuading her Government to increase the amount of the loan. As I have said already, the servicemen are leaving the forces so that they can buy a home, and the Cross report, on page 314, said:</PARA>
<PARA>A worthwhile home loan is seen by the Services as a significant retention incentive . . . some members separate in order to use their DFRDB commutation as a deposit on a home . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem-their salaries have dropped by comparison with the cost of living, and they have difficulties being two income families. Therefore, raising a deposit is extremely difficult unless they leave the forces and cash in their Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme (DFRDB) entitlements. If this were changed, we could see our way to encouraging people to stay in the forces and not need to leave in order to get that deposit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cross report was also very clear about the post-1985 people. We have a situation now where the Government is refusing to extend the benefits of this scheme to people who enlisted after May 1985. I find that quite unacceptable. The Cross report says:</PARA>
<PARA>As far as post-May 1985 personnel are concerned, some degree of dissatisfaction will persist until the uncertainty over their position is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill simply ignores the need for increasing the amount of the loan, but the exclusion of the post-1985 enlistees has been a conscious Government decision and is referred to specifically in the legislation. The Government has been saying for some time that it intends to come up with a new scheme for the people who enlisted after May 1985, but the constant failure to come up with the specifics of a scheme has left these people wondering and very unsettled. There is no evidence yet of an alternative scheme for enlistees to pin their hopes on. When we have so much wastage from the Defence Force and when some of the causes have been so clearly pinned down to conditions of service matters, it seems incomprehensible that the Government has not moved faster to try to give the details of a new benefit for these post-1985 people. The Minister has alluded to the fact that they have to spend six years in the Services before they become entitled, but she does not seem to recognise the fact that these people have now served about 3 1/2 years, and all that time there has been nothing positive and concrete given to them. She clearly does not recognise what an unsettling effect that has. </PARA>
<PARA> The distinction in the Services of having two lots of service personnel serving side by side, one lot who are serving their six years and becoming entitled to a loan, and the others who at this stage are not entitled and apparently will not be entitled to a loan, is very bad for morale. It simply has to be dealt with; we cannot go on any longer the way the Government has been coasting on this matter. My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Tim Fischer, tried to impose a legally binding timetable in relation to the scheme for new enlistees by moving a scalpel sunset clause in the lower House. He was thwarted because of the extraordinary construction of the Bill. I refer honourable senators to schedule 1-6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. Westpac is given the power of veto in this legislation over any parliamentary amendment, which allows Westpac to opt out of the agreement. We find that an extraordinary way to do business and it is most unsatisfactory for the Parliament to feel restricted in what it can do to the legislation without totally disrupting all the benefits which we want to flow on quickly to veterans and defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee of the Whole, I intend to move the same amendment that Mr Fischer moved in the House of Representatives. The point needs to be made, and made over and over again, that that problem is a serious one and needs addressing. We must see that people who enlisted after May 1985 become entitled to a meaningful defence service home loan, and preferably they should be treated on exactly the same basis as the colleagues beside whom they serve. The sunset clause will in no way impact on the existing specific agreement with Westpac. It merely says that if the Government has not honoured the promise which it has made to these post-May 1985 enlistees by 14 May 1991, the enlistees will become entitled to this existing defence service home loans scheme as a new category requiring a new additional agreement with Westpac or, alternatively perhaps, with somebody else. The amendment seeks only to protect those who have been left out in the cold by the Government. It does not interfere in any way with the Government's stated aims of providing a new scheme. The Opposition believes that, if the Government is so confident that it will formulate a new scheme in time, it should not be at all worried about accepting our scalpel sunset clause. In fact, we believe that our amendment is very responsible because it acknowledges Westpac's right to negotiate changes to the original agreement in the event of the scalpel being activated. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition accepts Westpac's escape option in the event of substantial alteration of the agreement, although it is not happy about that arrangement. But this Bill, under the terms of schedule 1, is constructed so as to cause anything, even amendments neutral to the agreement with Westpac, to be referred back to Westpac under the escape mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in the debate in the House of Representatives said that our amendment could give a free kick to Westpac. But our view is that the Government's negotiations should have included from the very beginning the post-1985 enlistees and that the Government was very defective in not including them in the original terms to be negotiated with the successful tenderer. We believe that the taxpayer would have got a better offer from the successful tenderer if the group of service people and veterans who were entitled had been wider and had not been finite, as is the case when only people who enlisted up to May 1985 are eligible. We believe also that it would have extended a benefit to those post-May 1985 people. Westpac would have benefited by having a larger pool, a continuing pool, of people coming to it for defence service loans. We seriously believe that the taxpayer would have been considerably better off because the sum paid to the Government by Westpac in buying the rights to the scheme could have been much larger. But even this routine amendment expressing the will of the Parliament and the unanimous will of Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Cross Committee, theoretically triggers that escape mechanism. It is clear that the parliamentary right to amend the Bill has been severely reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not intend to block the Bill because we are acutely aware of the fact that it is already well past the nominal starting date, which is 1 December. I draw attention to a most unfortunate occurrence; that is, that the Department of Veterans' Affairs saw fit to jump the gun and distribute correspondence from the Department and Westpac alerting people to the new scheme. This has been an unfortunate exercise on the part of both the Department and the bank and has led to a poor reaction from many people. I know that a number of my colleagues have had very concerned constituents. It has not been a good start for the Bill. It deserves a better start than the Department and Westpac have given it. I have spoken to Westpac along those lines and expressed my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Too many people have been waiting too long for the benefits contained in this Bill. Honourable senators will recall the several years of uncertainty as to the changes the Government was intending to make. Back in Senator Gietzelt's time as Minister for Veterans' Affairs we had a couple of unsuccessful attempts to privatise the defence service home loans scheme, and we had the debacle in the Budget last year when the $10,000 grant was proposed and met with such strong and justified resistance. The Opposition does not want the Bill delayed, and nor do many of the people who are waiting for a loan. But we remind the Government that it has serious shortcomings. The amount is too little, the portability is too restricted and the post-1985 people are not provided for. We remind the Government that two of these were the subject of the Cross report recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remind the Senate that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel gave a guarantee on 24 November in the House of Representatives, which I read into the record:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure at this stage whether exactly the same benefit as that given to the pre-1985s is the best for them, but I can give a guarantee that a form of home ownership will be offered to them and that it will be a very generous benefit . . . honourable members can be sure that those people will be looked after. </PARA>
<PARA>Later she said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I reiterate that guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it somewhat qualified and I am concerned at that. The Minister may not have intended to qualify it but it does not sound to me that there is certainty that these people will be included in this scheme. I am very reluctant to see two schemes operating side by side. The Minister's efforts in this area will be monitored very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the best way to deal with the concerns I have outlined in my speech are by way of a second reading amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) there has been a long delay in introducing the proposed legislation to establish a new Defence Service Home Loans Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) without some kind of adjustment, the arrangements entered into by the Commonwealth Government with Westpac are an attempt to deny the Senate its constitutional right to make certain amendments to the proposed legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the proposed new Scheme should not be further delayed, but should be improved as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the amount of the loan should be increased to reflect the current cost of housing;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) holders of loans granted prior to December 1987 should enjoy a right to portability;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Defence Force personnel who enlisted since May 1985 should be included in the proposed Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) a review of the Scheme should be provided for after the first 2 years of operation''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill I urge honourable senators not to lose sight of the dual objectives of the defence service home loans scheme. On the one hand, it is a recognition of the efforts of past and present service personnel; on the other it is, or was, an incentive for civilians to join our forces. It is not the intention of the Australian Democrats to obstruct the passage of this Bill. In principle we support it but we have some serious comment to make about the manner in which it has been brought before the Senate and about its serious deficiencies, to which we will address ourselves in committee stage amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in his second reading speech outlined the Government's rationale behind the decision to sell the assets of the Defence Service Homes Corporation to the Westpac Banking Corporation. Sadly, the Bill does not stand up to the scrutiny in these terms and appears to be of greater benefit to the Government and Westpac than to present and past defence personnel. That is not to say that it is not a relative improvement over the circumstances in which borrowers now find themselves. The Bill will be somewhat of a windfall for the Government as Westpac will pay a premium of $100m for its involvement in the scheme. In addition, the Government will save $11.5m per annum through retrenchment or reassignment of the 360 Defence Service Homes Corporation staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the apparent benefits to eligible persons outlined by the Minister in his second reading speech are the removal of the 10-month waiting period for concessional loans and the opportunity to borrow in excess of $25,000 at a first mortgage interest rate without incurring additional establishment charges. The Australian Democrats advocate that on closer examination of these supposed benefits it is revealed that they are inaccurate or at best dubious grounds on which to base support for the legislation before us. The Australian Democrats, of course, welcome the removal of the 10-month waiting period. However, to suggest, as the Government has suggested, that this will save borrowers thousands of dollars in bridging finance is a spurious argument. A modicum of planning would ensure that would-be borrowers availed themselves of the $25,000 concessional loan well before entering the real estate market in search of a home, thereby negating the need for any bridging finance. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the ability to borrow money in excess of the $25,000 concessional loan at first mortgage interest rates, the Government is pulling the wool over service personnel's eyes on two counts. Firstly, the simple fact is that if the concessional loan were raised to more realistic levels which reflected the rise in property values around Australia, as outlined earlier by Senator Newman, many eligible persons would not need additional mortgages, or at least would need only a very small second mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA> As it stands, the concessional loan will be a useful contribution to the major loan provided by Westpac at market rates. This raises the second and more deceitful point with respect to the alleged benefits, namely that home buyers will be able to borrow in excess of $25,000 at first mortgage interest rates. Following deregulation in April 1986, banks have ceased to offer so-called cocktail home loans consisting of first home loans at a subsidised rate and additional top-up loans at a more expensive interest rate. All current home loans are at a market rate, currently 14.5 per cent interest per annum, and banks, including Westpac, generally only make a distinction between owner-occupied in commercial properties to charge varying rates of interest. Therefore, there is no advantage for eligible defence service home buyers to borrow additional money in excess of $25,000 with Westpac or any other bank under the proposed scheme compared with previous arrangements other than saving two sets of loan establishment charges. However, given that these are of a one-off nature and of an average of $800 to $900 they do not constitute a compelling argument for the transfer from the present format. The Australian Democrats have no objection to the proposed transfer to Westpac provided the new scheme ensures a significant improvement in benefits to recipients of defence service home loans. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to a matter of even greater concern and that is the manner in which the Bill has been drafted and introduced. It is rare for a Bill to be passed through both Houses of this Parliament without amendments as various parties and community organisations seek to make changes which will optimise its benefits to their interest groups. However, this normal process has been denied under the present Bill-or there has been an attempt to deny it. For those honourable senators who may not have had the time to study the Bill in detail, I point out that we have before us an unprecedented piece of legislation to which, in effect, no major amendments can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill has been drafted is such that should any amendments be passed which are unacceptable to Westpac, Westpac can withdraw from the agreement altogether. This is legislation by decree. It makes a mockery of the normal parliamentary process through quashing any amendments that might otherwise arise from debate on the matter. To add insult to injury, the Government has gone one step further. Through this piece of extraordinary legislative drafting not only has it effectively stifled debate on the Bill or amendment to the Bill but also it has pre-empted any decisions that Parliament may have reached by sending out letters to the current holders of concessional loans informing them of a likely transfer before it has even been debated in both Houses. One wonders whether an improvement in the provision of service to veterans is a priority of this Government, or whether it is more concerned with cutting costs through the retrenchment and deployment of 360 Defence Service Homes Corporation staff as part of a larger strategy to absorb the function of the Department of Veterans' Affairs among generic State and Commonwealth agencies. We have made a reference to what we believe to be that intention in earlier questions and statements in the appropriations debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the manner in which this legislation has been introduced into this chamber and the manner in which the public notification has been made is utterly presumptuous. For the Government to place before the Senate a Bill which it says it cannot amend is without precedent and should be totally unacceptable to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wonder whether the Government is aware of an extraordinary irony that may arise should the scheme be transferred to a private banking corporation such as Westpac. I am referring to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 18 August 1988 which noted that the most cost effective funding method for Westpac to take over the Defence Service Homes Corporation would be `to tap the secondary mortgage market and to effectively convert the loans into marketable securities'. Should such a scenario unfold it would lead to large parcels of Defence Force home mortgages going to Japanese investors. Thus the Government may find itself in the embarrassing position of having facilitated a process whereby the guarantors of loans to Australian veterans are the very members of nations which our service personnel fought against during World War II. It is of no substance or consequence 40 years after the event, but it is an interesting irony to note. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to a number of proposed Democrat amendments and requests for amendments which will significantly improve the scheme for eligible home buyers in spite of the limitations which have been imposed upon us. The Democrats reject the suggestion that under any circumstances this House of review does not have the right of amendment. It is interesting to draw a comparison between these amendments which we will move at the committee stage and which we circulated yesterday with the proposed amendments that have just been circulated as a second reading motion amendment proposed by the Opposition. We will develop more this coincidence and the relative attitudes of the Democrats to the process of amendment and that which may reveal to be the case with the Opposition's strategy in relation to a second reading motion amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the foreshadowed Democrat amendments. Firstly, as stated earlier, in view of current real estate values and of the recommendation by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Cross Committee, to significantly increase concessional loans, the Australian Democrats will introduce an amendment to increase the loan for eligible home buyers to $45,000. The second of our proposed amendments seeks to remove a further anomaly which exists simply because defence personnel do not apply at the right time, and that is the portability of concessional loans. Currently, only those personnel who obtain a loan after December 1987 enjoy portability. Given that employment in the forces frequently entails transfers to other interstate and intrastate locations, often at short notice, defence personnel may be forced to sell their homes at regular intervals. Portability, therefore, is essential. The Democrats will move an amendment which seeks to extend portability of concessional loans to those who borrowed prior to December 1987. Thirdly, under present regulations certain World War II ex-service women who undertook home service but did not serve in overseas postings are ineligible for defence service home loans. While the number of women who would be eligible or who, in view of their age, would wish to seek such a loan may be small, the Democrats wish to rectify this anomaly to ensure such loans are provided to defence personnel irrespective of their sex. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these amendments the Democrats will also seek a number of assurances from the Government in the following areas. Firstly, we seek an assurance from the Government that it will review its decision to exclude persons whose first service in the Defence Force began after 14 May 1985-in other words, the post-1985ers, to whom Senator Newman referred earlier, who are not embraced by the provisions of this Bill. We have the assurance from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, that she will address this anomaly in the very near future. Clearly, this decision will do little to stem the flow of personnel who leave the forces. Nor will it provide an incentive to those contemplating joining them unless the anomaly is rectified promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will also seek an undertaking from the Government to facilitate the establishment of an agency which would provide a range of real estate services, for want of a better term, to Defence Force personnel. This unit would specifically enable defence home owners to sell, lease, exchange or let their homes more readily, perhaps to other service personnel, should the need arise. Such a scheme would be particularly meritorious when one considers the frequency with which personnel are transferred, often at short notice, and when one acknowledges that a wife and family are often left while the husband goes off early to take up a posting with the difficult task of finding a new lessee or, alternatively, selling the home. The Democrats believe that such a facility would be of great merit. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Democrats seek an assurance from the Government that the new scheme will be reviewed after two years by an independent committee to ensure that service personnel are in no way deleteriously affected by the new arrangements. If the Westpac Banking Corporation sees fit to withdraw from the agreement as a result of any amendments passed in this chamber, one may well ask whose needs are really serviced by this Bill. If Westpac is truly committed to providing a service to the defence forces, it should welcome the implementation of any recommendations made by the Cross Committee and the Senate. The community should welcome Westpac's willingness to adopt and maintain such a service to the mutual advantage, it would seem, of all parties. Therefore, I advise that in essence the Australian Democrats support the intent of this Bill but we believe that it is inadequate and we will attempt to rectify those inadequacies in committee stage amendments. Above all, we abhor the manner in which this Bill was brought before the Senate and its drafting in a deliberate attempt to deprive the chamber of its entitled process of review and constructive amendment of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill, or the Westpac Bill as it is more commonly known in defence and veterans' circles throughout Australia. It is heartening to see that the Government is embarking upon a program of adopting coalition policy. It is privatising a significant government operation. I hope that the Government will continue to implement our policies. Some improvement would perhaps then be seen in the way military personnel and retired service men and women are treated in this country instead of the slaphappy attitudes experienced these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The defence service home loans scheme was first established in 1918 to assist those who served overseas during World War I to re-establish themselves in civilian life. Eligibility for benefits was extended to include those who served or were appointed or enlisted to serve overseas in World War II and later conflicts. In order to attract and retain regular service men and women in an all-volunteer Defence Force, in 1973 the benefits were extended to members of the Defence Force who completed the required qualifying service, currently six years. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 May 1985, in one of this Government's regular May economic statements, it announced that it would privatise the defence service home loans scheme. Today, after 3 1/2 years, it has finally reached an agreement with the Westpac Banking Corporation. This Bill provides for the new scheme and enacts the agreement, schedule 1, on the basis of a $25,000 loan scheme at a blended rate of 6.85 per cent. The delay of 10 months in processing applications is also effectively eliminated for eligible veterans and peacetime service personnel. While I commend the Government for finally trying to get something right by improving conditions for our service personnel, I want to raise some inconsistencies in this treatment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity this afternoon to make some comments about the Australian scholastic aptitude test and its use especially in Queensland, the State that I represent. More particularly, I wish to outline to students and parents that errors which occurred in this particular test this year are far less likely to occur again. The Australian scholastic aptitude test, or ASAT as it is normally called, was developed by the Australian Council for Educational Research, or ACER, for the Board of Secondary School Studies in Queensland, the accrediting agency in the Australian Capital Territory and the Secondary Education Authority of Western Australia. It is used in Queensland to help determine students' tertiary entrance scores. The TE score, as the tertiary entrance score is called in Queensland, is of extreme importance to students who are about to complete their secondary schooling or who have just completed their year 12. The score is critical for those who wish to enter a tertiary institution and for those who aim to enter a particular faculty or school at a post-secondary educational institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With demand for tertiary places being so strong, students aim to achieve as high a TE score as possible. It is not surprising that students approach the completion of their ASAT papers with a great deal of concern, so it is possible to understand statements during the year when, as students were completing their ASAT papers, an error was discovered. A demand was made to set that test aside and require students to sit a further test about six weeks later. The editorial in the Brisbane Sun of Friday 26 August this year well reflected the anger of many year 12 students and their parents. That editorial stated, under a heading of `Kids pay for adult foul-up':</PARA>
<PARA> As if it isn't tough enough for Queensland's year 12 students already. The fact that they have to sit for the Australian Scholastic Aptitude (ASAP) Test in the first place as part of their quest for a tertiary education is hard. </PARA>
<PARA> But now they have to do it again because some people who should have known better fouled up. It's not good enough to just say sorry and add that no student would be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is, it was someone's fault and everyone who has to do the test a second time has to be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In case the oldies have forgotten, there's something about getting psyched up for a test which almost certainly will have a bearing on the rest of your life. </PARA>
<PARA> To have to line up and do it all again must be very draining at a time when our teenagers need all their energies for their other studies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the Australian Council for Educational Research in Melbourne, controlled locally by the Board of Secondary School Studies, should be given a quick kick where it hurts. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Minister should find out who in Queensland was supposed to check the test and deliver a swift kick there, too. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone had taken time to have a quick look at the test it surely would have been noticed that not one of the three answers given in the multiple-choice question was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Let's face it, if one of the 28,000 students who did the test didn't read the question properly and made a similar blue it could have cost him or her dearly in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA>Queensland year 12 students duly presented themselves for the second sitting of the ASAT test and one can just imagine their horror when they read in the next morning's newspaper that there were further printing errors in that test as well. The Queensland Board of Secondary School Studies executive officer stated that the errors were not such that a third test was required, but this was little comfort for the 30,000 or so students who had completed the test for the second time. By now they would have lost faith in the testing process and no doubt many would be worrying about the effect of all of this bungling on the TE scores. I was sufficiently concerned at about this stage to issue a press statement criticising those involved in the preparation of the test. Amongst many other things, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Federal Government annually pays about $550,000 to the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), the body which compiles the ASAT test. </PARA>
<PARA> If the errors on either occasion have their source in the ACER, the Federal Government's contribution to that body must be seriously questioned. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> If the errors occurred in Queensland, a giant administrative shake up is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Queensland and Federal Governments should immediately investigate the circumstances surrounding the errors and announce to the public what remedial action will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that my views were identical to those of many students and parents in Queensland. After my comments were drawn to the attention of the Director of ACER, Dr Barry McGaw, he was good enough to write to me about what he termed `the difficulties that were experienced with the Australian scholastic aptitude test in Queensland this year'. Dr McGaw indicated to me that ASAT test drafts are first trialed in New Zealand. To me, this seems to be a excellent procedure. It allows data to be obtained from the testing of a group to which the final version would not be administered. On the basis of analysis of data collected in New Zealand an Australian scholastic aptitude test is created. This test is subject to scrutiny by the agencies who have commissioned it. Some changes may be made at this meeting. It appears that it is during this process, when changes were made to the draft test, that errors occurred. It is not necessary to dwell on what did occur this year but I am pleased to be able to report that Dr McGaw has indicated to me that the ACER's procedures in this critical area have been reviewed and some significant changes have been made. I quote Dr McGaw's letter. He stated, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, we have proposed that any changes to items suggested at that final meeting be made during the meeting, be checked by the participants and be formally approved. When the final form of the test is then prepared, we will have two external experts take the full test. We will also send it to the three commissioning agencies for them to check and authorise prior to the production of the film from which printing is undertaken. These extra checks will make the timeline tighter but we believe they are now necessary and justified. </PARA>
<PARA>I am satisfied that ACER has now taken every reasonable step to ensure that errors such as those which plagued the ASAT this year will not occur in the future. Students who sit for the ASAT next year, and in following years, have every reason to be certain that they will not be confused by errors in their test papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill, and I guess that is not surprising as in fact we have demanded a National Crime Authority (NCA) office in South Australia for some time-a demand that was at first rejected strenuously by the State Government in South Australia, and it was not the subject of much enthusiasm from the Hawke Federal Government either. Clearly this Bill is so structured as to enable the appointment of an extra member of the Authority to take up a specific reference, and that specific reference is related to South Australia. We are therefore pleased that finally the Government of South Australia and the Commonwealth Government came to the conclusion that the appointment of a new member of the Authority and the setting up of an office in South Australia was necessary and was the most appropriate response to the worrying elevation of organised crime and official corruption that has become apparent in South Australia. I do not know whether the levels of organised crime and official corruption have become higher or whether it has simply over a period of time become more widely appreciated by the people of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to a rather sorry story of camouflage and cover-up by the South Australian Government in an attempt to sweep under the carpet the situation developing in South Australia rather than face its responsibilities as a Government to counter effectively organised crime and to root out the official corruption that is necessary for organised crime to exist. That brings me back to a speech I made in the Senate some months ago which I guess started the development of the process that has led to this Bill. My comments in relation to South Australia were really simply incidental to the principal purpose of the speech, which was to respond to the evaluation of the NCA by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which has responsibility for monitoring the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the Committee was established under the National Crime Authority Act because of the special coercive powers that had been given to the new Authority and the belief that if such powers were to be given then there had also, on the other side of the ledger, to be greater safeguards than we would normally associate with law enforcement bodies. So this unique monitoring committee was established, a committee that is unique to the law enforcement process in Australia. That Committee, as I indicated a moment ago, reported to the Parliament on its initial evaluation of the NCA's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will be aware, there have been some criticisms of the way in which the NCA has operated and there have been some highly publicised acquittals that have raised questions about the competence and methodology of the NCA. I was saying in that speech that the performance of the NCA had to be judged against difficulties that it was encountering in its operations, and I made specific reference to the fact that the liaison officer who had been appointed for Queensland to liaise with the National Crime Authority on behalf of the State police force had been found to be corrupt and, at that time, the police liaison officer appointed by South Australia was before the courts. The case against him has since been dismissed but, putting the matter in its context at that time, I was saying that the NCA's performance must be judged against these extraordinary difficulties that it was encountering in its operations. I referred to the level of police corruption in Queensland that was becoming apparent from the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into possible illegal activities and Associated Police Misconduct, and I referred to levels of police corruption that have been well known for a long time in New South Wales. I said that, regrettably, South Australia was not exempt from this picture. As I work in the eastern States, I can read newspaper reports of criminal cases proceeding in South Australia that are subject to suppression orders in that State. In South Australian newspapers names, charges and circumstances are suppressed. Therefore, because these things were on the public record in the eastern States, there was reason at that time to be concerned about what was happening in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I was aware that the then head of the drug squad in South Australia was before the courts, the person who had been selected by the police to head up `Operation Noah', to call upon South Australians to come forward with information that could bring to justice those who were committing offences associated with drugs. I was aware that the allegation being made against him, the head of the drug squad in South Australia, was that he was selling drugs out of police headquarters. Exhibits from previous cases were taken with such confidence that he would not be apprehended that the exhibit numbers were not even being removed from the drugs before they were sold. I believed that anyone who had that information had to be concerned with what was going on in South Australia. How could the system be so faulty that the head of the drug squad could be engaging in this illegal activity with such great confidence that there was no chance of him being apprehended?</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the circumstances in which he was apprehended. It was out of a reference given to the National Crime Authority into drug matters, and out of that reference the NCA had staked out a marijuana plantation. Lo and behold, they found the head of the South Australian Drug Squad visiting the plantation. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the time in this Parliament, without being able to relate those circumstances in detail-that would have prejudiced the case in South Australia and been in breach of the South Australian suppression order-that I was concerned about what was happening in relation to organised crime in South Australia and I was concerned that the police at the highest levels were not making sufficient effort to counter it. Those comments seemed to me to be moderate and reasonable in the circumstances. I was therefore stunned by the reaction of the State Government, to the effect that how dare I suggest that there could be this organised crime or official corruption in South Australia. The State Government was totally aware of all the matters of which I was aware-those that were on the public record in the eastern States and, furthermore, other information with which the NCA was keeping it up to date. Yet the Government still came out publicly and said, `How dare you say these things are happening in South Australia. What you are doing is defaming the whole of the South Australian Police Force'. As if that was not bad enough, the Police Commissioner then got brought into it to give an unprecedented press conference, to bucket me, to say how dare I suggest that there are problems in the South Australian Police Force, even when the Police Commissioner knew that the head of his own drug squad was before the courts. One of the most sorry aspects of this whole matter is the way in which the South Australian Government was prepared to use the head of the Police Force in South Australia in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, the editorials came in, with the Adelaide Advertiser and the Adelaide News asking, `How can Hill make these suggestions about South Australia, the finest police force in the world? What right has he got to damn the whole of the police force?' Of course none of the editorial writers had bothered to read the speech that I had made in the Senate in which I indicated that I believed the South Australian problem was an isolated one and, furthermore, that the vast majority of South Australian police are excellent officers doing a wonderful job in difficult circumstances, underpaid and under-rewarded. Did anybody bother about that sort of detail? No. What the State Government had to do was deflect the criticism rather than face up to it, which is what it should have done. It was not prepared to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> So there I am being bucketed by the State Government and bucketed by the Police Commissioner, both of whom had all the information I had. But they knew that my arm was tied behind my back, and unless I was going to be totally irresponsible I would not be able to come back and justify what I had said because I was not going to prejudice cases that were before the court and I was not going to break confidences arising from information given to the NCA monitoring committee of which I was a member. I must say that being treated in that way by a State Government in order for it to camouflage and cover up its inadequacies in this area has been the most enlightening experience that I have had in my 7 1/2 years in this business. </PARA>
<PARA> From there, Madam Deputy President, unfortunately the position did not improve. These matters started to become public, and the Moyes case became public after his conviction-and he pleaded guilty; he admitted what was going on in police headquarters. What associates he had in the corrupt enterprise has never been established. The police line is that he had none. Is that really tenable; is it believable that he could be so confident as to engage in this corrupt business and no-one else in the police force knew anything about it? When that came onto the public record the State Government reluctantly acknowledged that it had a problem and that it had to do something. What was its answer? It said that it would set up an anti-corruption body within the South Australian Police Force. It knew that that would be ineffective. It would be ineffective because police officers simply would not come forward to give information to a body that was within their own police force. So it sought to provide an ineffective answer to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, the pattern continued. More information became public, and the Government realised that it had to do something else. The Channel 10 program, Page 1, detailed how the drug squad in South Australia for years had been engaging in illegal activity itself. That allegation was never properly answered; never even properly denied. Nothing happened as a result of that program, but public concern rose. Newspapers were starting to become interested in the level of corruption and the level of organised crime in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Adelaide Advertiser interviewed a protected witness of the NCA, referred to as Mr X, who gave detailed revelations of criminal activity in South Australia and the names of those who had been associated with it. The Advertiser gives the information to the police. The police say, `This is wonderful new information. Thank you for being so helpful'. But the police have always been properly advised by the NCA; kept informed. That is what we are led to believe. But anyway, the police responded to the new information. The Advertiser stories brought greater public expressions of concern and the State Government realised that it had to do more than provide an internal anti-corruption office, especially since calls were starting to be made for public inquiries. A member of the State Parliament was starting to call for the setting up of a permanent public anti-corruption body-the worst thing that could possibly happen for the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I was saying all along that that was not the way to go. If the problem in South Australia was isolated pockets of corruption, a major permanent public anti-corruption body, or royal commission, was not the way to go. It might have been in different circumstances in other places, but in public inquiries the innocent get hurt as well as the guilty and there was not enough evidence on the table for me to come forward-which I could have, and some would have said it would have been a good political angle-and say there should be this public inquiry. I said there should be an NCA office set up in South Australia because it could get the correct focus. The focus would be on organised crime and out of that organised crime would come evidence of the official corruption which, as I said a moment ago, allows all corruption to exist and unfortunately to flourish. So an NCA office would have set the right focus. It had the skilled personnel; it had the experience of three or four years' operation, particularly in the eastern States, in which time expertise had been built up; it would operate in private so that no damage would be done to innocent reputations; and it would be independent of the South Australian Police Force so it would enable people to come forward with confidence. It seemed to me in all the circumstances that that was the right response to this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> For months the South Australian Government said `We won't do it'. But then, because of the community pressures that were being built up, it finally said, `Okay. We will do it'. In fact, it came out and said, `This is the perfect answer to the problem'. Astonishing! But even then it was not prepared to go the whole way and make it workable, because it intended to provide a downgraded version. It would not have been headed up by a new member of the Authority at all; it would in effect have been a branch office. That would have been ineffective because unless there was a person heading it up of sufficient stature to give confidence to those who had information within the community and who, with good reason, were scared to come forward and give that information, they simply would not come forward; the NCA would not get the information it needed, and it would prove ineffective. Ultimately, when we pressed this on the Government, it said, `Okay, we will appoint a new member of the Authority' and we therefore come to this Bill appointing a new member of the Authority and giving that member a specific reference to deal with the South Australian problem. The terms of reference were made public, ultimately, by the South Australian Government. Senator Tate actually took the correct position when--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McKiernan" NAMEID="1I4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody has heard any criticism from me of Senator Tate in this exercise, but the Senate will hear a lot of the South Australian Government and the Police Minister. They provided terms of reference. But then we find out, not from Senator Tate but from Dr Hopgood, that stated in the material that supports the terms of reference are the names of 56 individuals-56 principal targets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say-and I have known a bit about this business over the last six months-that I was stunned to hear that. It indicated to me that the problem was much more widespread, much more complex, and a much greater problem than I ever envisaged existed. I had talked about isolated pockets of corruption, because that is all I knew of. But it now seems, on the basis of the information that the Government has put forward, that the problem is much greater. If the State Government knew all along that that was the extent of the problem, as it must have because it would have been kept properly informed by the NCA, why did it not act? Why did it continually push this matter under the carpet? When we said, in the last few days, that we are now worried by the extent of this problem in South Australia if there are 56 principal targets, Dr Hopgood's response is, `Don't take any notice of that. That doesn't really mean much; it is all pub talk'. I can tell you, Madam Deputy President, that the NCA would not agree to the inclusion of those names in that reference if there was not evidence sufficient to warrant further investigation. They are not simply names about whom allegations have been made. People are not listed as principal targets in NCA investigations into organised crime or official corruption unless there is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation to see whether that evidence is such that these people can be brought before the courts. So the problem in South Australia is much more extensive and deep-rooted than ever I imagined. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned still about a number of things. I am pleased that this matter has gone as far as it has today, but I am concerned about the composition of that list of names. Who determined that list? Senator Tate said in this place, `I had no part to do with it', and then we find from Dr Hopgood that it was a list determined by Justice Stewart, head of the NCA, the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and Dr Hopgood, the State Police Minister. What role have the Federal Attorney-General and the State Police Minister in determining the composition of the list of principal targets? Is there a political input? One becomes suspicious because we are told by the State Government that all of those about whom serious accusations are made in the Mr X tapes are included in the investigation. But then we are told, `No ex-politicians are included', and yet we know that ex-politicians were included in the Mr X tapes. What is going on? We do not know. We still do not know the extent of the investigation; we do not know how widespread the Government knows the corruption is. We have not been brought into the Government's confidence in that regard. We now do not know whether an NCA office is a sufficient response if the problem is much greater than we ever envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> We experienced this same veil of secrecy with the State Government in relation to a request by the NCA monitoring committee for the balance of the last NCA report on the problems in South Australia. As the Senate may be aware, the State Government put down in the Parliament only the last chapter of that report. But in that chapter allegations were made by the NCA about law enforcement bodies in South Australia, and whether they had been doing their job properly. The monitoring committee has a responsibility to ensure, if the NCA is to make such statements, that they are well-founded, that they are justified. The monitoring committee cannot do that without putting that statement in the context of the balance of the report. So the Committee on the National Crime Authority-a committee that comprises members of both sides of this Parliament and both chambers-then wrote to the State Attorney-General, saying, `We would appreciate the balance of this report, obviously with the names of people excised. We are not interested in operational detail like that but we are interested in being able to determine whether the NCA is doing its job properly'. What happens? The State Government, through Mr Sumner, confers with the Federal Attorney-General and says `No, we are not going to provide you with that material'. In other words, they were not going to provide us with the material that is necessary for our monitoring committee to do its job properly. Why is that matter being covered up? I do not know. I know that the Federal Attorney-General has been given a copy of the report with the consent of Mr Sumner. Why not the committee of the Parliament that has the responsibility to monitor the performance of the NCA? I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters that I am concerned about in relation to this new body. I am concerned not only about the fact that the 56 names have been determined by a political process, but also about the fact that the operation is going to be totally funded by State Government. This is the only instance to my knowledge-the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) might correct me when he speaks-where a State government has been solely providing the funding. As honourable senators would know, under this Bill when the reference ceases the new member of the Authority ceases to exist, and the reference will cease when the funding ceases. So the State Government has still got control of this reference, and it shoud not have in view of its record in relation to this matter. The Commonwealth should be playing a role also. So that is another concern that I have. I am concerned as to whether the funding will be maintained. I look forward to learning who has been appointed to be the member of the Authority to take on this task, because that is going to be critically important. As Senator Tate has had an input into that, I know that it will not be some political crony-unless, of course, the State Government in South Australia has determined who it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> So a number of problems will continue to exist after this Bill is passed. Until we have before us the full picture of organised crime and official corruption in South Australia, until the State Government comes clean and faces up to its responsibility in this area rather than trying to avoid the political odium that flows from its totally unsatisfactory performance in this area, we will not know what is the total and correct response to this particular problem. I welcome the fact that the Government has finally been drawn to this position. I welcome the fact that a new member of the Authority will be appointed and that there will be a permanent office in South Australia that will have the capacity at least to take steps towards countering the scourge of organised crime and official corruption in my State. I only regret that it has been such a difficult and tortuous path to get to this stage. I certainly commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it amendments to the National Crime Authority Act which will enable the National Crime Authority to establish an office in South Australia-not merely a branch office but an office which will be headed by a member of the Authority; that is, a person with all the powers and functions which are bestowed on Mr Justice Stewart and the other two members of the National Crime Authority at the moment. I think that indicates a very real desire on the part of both the South Australian Government and this Government, in so far as it is facilitating the passage of this legislation, to investigate the very serious allegations of corruption and of organised criminal activity and, embracing that, drug trafficking, that have been made in relation to events and persons in South Australia. The fact is that it was only a couple of weeks ago, on 24 November, that the intergovernmental committee of the National Crime Authority, meeting in Queensland, decided that this reference was warranted, and it did so on the basis of a report from the South Australian Government, which naturally acted on the advice of its Commissioner of Police, that the South Australian law enforcement authorities were unable by the use of ordinary police methods to get to the heart of the corruption and the illegal activity, the organised criminal activity including drug trafficking, which was alleged to be occurring in South Australia on a scale which it was beyond their abilities to cope with even with the best will in the world. I certainly assume on the part of the Commissioner an honest and best will to combat corruption and organised criminal activity in South Australia, but particularly where the corruption involves police officers there are all the dangers of the undermining of our way of life and, indeed, of our confidence in the democratic processes themselves. If the police forces, the law enforcement authorities on whom ordinary citizens citizens rely for an impartial enforcement of the laws passed by our parliaments, cannot be relied upon we are in great strife.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is in relation to that recognition by the inter-governmental committee of the National Crime Authority that this Bill is brought before the chamber, to enable this office to be set up. It will be set up and there are certain targets who have been nominated, but I think it is important to emphasise that certainly I do not know the names of the targets. Senator Hill says that Dr Hopgood has indicated that there are some 56 of them. I do not know the number but that may well be the case. The names of course-and I think some reassurance is required-are as agreed to by the National Crime Authority and the relevant Minister in South Australia. But I do not think one should emphasise the term `agreement' as if it were the case that the National Crime Authority would somehow be restricted or beholden to the view of the South Australian Government as to who might appear on that list. It is inconceivable to me and I am sure to all honourable senators in this chamber that Mr Justice Stewart would accept a proposition that a member of the National Crime Authority be given a term of reference with the scope of the investigation already being predetermined, as it were, by a narrowly drawn range of targets being circumscribed so that they were the only persons in respect of whom the special coercive powers conferred on the Authority could be brought into play in order to gather the admissible evidence which one hopes will be the result of the investigations undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the point that Senator Hill raised concerning who will be the member of the Authority to undertake this particular reference. I cannot disclose the name of that person because the matter will finally go, on passage of this legislation, to the Executive Council and the Governor-General next Wednesday. It will only be after then that the name can properly be disclosed. I can assure Senator Hill that the person concerned will be of sufficient eminence and of sufficient experience to enable him to conclude that the investigation will be under expert supervision, and because of the nature of the experience of the person concerned this new member should focus, as is required in the legislation, on the compiling of admissible evidence. We do not want yet another investigation which does not lead to properly founded cases in the courts; we want cases which, if they get to the courts, one hopes will succeed if the prosecution can prove the elements of the various offences beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding to be undertaken by the State Government was a matter which Senator Hill mentioned as though once again this could be used as a lever to enable the State Government to sabotage the investigation should it get too close to the bone, perhaps. I think that is the inference. I believe once again that Senator Hill has painted a very unrealistic scenario. The fact is that the State Government has undertaken to establish the office and to provide for all its operating costs. That will be a considerable expenditure. I think just between now and the end of this financial year expenditure will total $1.4m, and therefore over the full succeeding financial year it will be around $2.8m to $3m. So it is a very considerable amount of money that is being put to this task by the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, by the way, that this problem warrants very considerable money being put into it. Members of the public might not fully realise that when the National Crime Authority does establish an operation under a term of reference and with certain targets in mind the office or team which it establishes include not only policemen seconded from various police forces throughout Australia but also lawyers, accountants, special investigators, intelligence analysts, surveillance officers and administrative and other support staff. So the full team will be there in South Australia undertaking this investigation and it is quite unreal to suggest, if there were any attempt to withdraw funds because the South Australian Government thought that the matter had reached a certain point where further investigation should not be undertaken, that Mr Justice Stewart would not inform the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority on this frustration of a term of reference, that he would not inform the inter-governmental committee consisting of all Attorneys from around Australia of this fact. Indeed, I believe he would inform the Parliament of this fact as under the Statute, as I recall, he is entitled so to do in his annual report. So I believe that those particular fears are unfounded and Senator Hill's misgivings will not be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> Since we need to get through another Bill I will not linger on the National Crime Authority Bill. It is extremely important legislation. The task to be undertaken by the National Crime Authority is particularly suited to its mode of operation-to, as Senator Hill said, the proper secrecy-with which it operates and to the very considerable powers with which it is vested. I am pleased that the Parliament is now reaching the point where it will enable his home State, about which I know he has a very genuine concern as to the integrity of its law enforcement capability and as to the presence of organised crime, and the people of South Australia to be well served by this National Crime Authority office, established under this legislation at the request of the South Australia Government. I now table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. It is an omnibus Bill dealing with a number of amendments to a number of different pieces of legislation that relate to the Attorney-General's portfolio. It seeks to amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to provide for term appointments. That seems to us to be a sound improvement to that Act, offering greater flexibility in the staffing of the Tribunal, so obviously that has our support. It seeks to amend the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, again to give greater flexibility in administration in that it will give the Commissioner, not the Minister, power to determine the number of officers in the various rank levels of the Australian Federal Police. No doubt that will relate to funding restraints, but it seems to us to be a worthwhile improvement in the Federal Police legislation. The Bill also seeks to incorporate the various merit principles in promotion in the same way as they apply to public servants, and although I have expressed some concern on a previous occasion that merit principles do not actually refer to merit at all, but rather prohibit patronage or discrimination on various specified grounds, nevertheless it is a system as a whole that has the support of the Australian Federal Police Association and when put in terms of new pay scales that have just been announced and greater flexibility in promotions, as I mentioned, it seems as a whole to be an improvement to the legislative base for the Australian Federal Police. I will come back to the Federal police briefly in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to amend the Customs Act. We are prepared to support that amendment; nevertheless I want to express a reservation: it is an amendment that will specifically abrogate the self-incrimination privilege in respect of a statement furnished to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy pursuant to a court order. Certainly there are restrictions in the Bill as to what might then be done with evidence that is provided in this way; nevertheless any loss of traditional civil liberties is something to be approached cautiously. We find that in this amendment to the Customs Act there is a further loss of the basic right against self-incrimination. We are prepared to accept it in this instance but we do so with some reservation. It is always a matter of trying to find the right balance between what information is necessary for law enforcement bodies such as the Australian Customs Service to carry out their function effectively and what is necessary to maintain basic civil liberties. Unfortunately we seem to be continually taking away those civil liberties in the cause of more effective law enforcement and we should remind ourselves that there is always a loss. It is important that we should go cautiously down this path and maintain the correct balance. I make special mention of that because it occurs again in another instance in this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act which we support. It also provides amendments to the Family Law Act of 1975. It puts the Northern Territory in the same position as a State in relation to particular matters and also it provides that a lawyer appointed by the court as a separate representative for a child in proceedings concerning the child's welfare is able to seek an order that the custodian of the child produce that child for a psychiatric or psychological report. I do not think it is restricted to a lawyer but the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) might like to address that; the second reading speech would suggest that it is. We can, I guess, imagine circumstances in which providing such a capacity is in the best interests of the child, nevertheless we intend to monitor that provision. There are some aspects of it that make us feel a little uncomfortable and we will be looking, in due course, at how often and in what circumstances that power is exercised. Around Australia there has been some criticism in recent years, particularly of State community welfare organisations and the role that they have played in relation to children vis-a-vis the parents of those children. We, being naturally cautious people, will look to see how in practice this provision operates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides amendments to the Law Officers Act which appear to us to be sound; they relate to properly remunerating and offering proper security to the Solicitor-General. They appear to be an improvement in the legislation. The Bill also provides amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act of 1987, an Act that was passed not long ago. It is a bit of a pity that it was not got right in the first instance; nevertheless we will support the amendment. Lastly, the Bill includes amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, and it is in relation to that Act that we also see another abrogation of the right not to give self-incriminating evidence. Again I express the caution that I mentioned a few moments ago. As a whole we see these amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act as being in the best interests of effective law enforcement; that is, they further improve the capacity to put pressure upon the assets that have arisen out of illegal activity rather than simply upon the individual. It is a tool in the hands of government and law enforcement officers that has proven worth while in the last few years. Improving efficiency and capacity in the area is worth while but, as I said, again we express a reservation when doing so requires abrogation of a basic right not to self-incriminate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of other comments on the part of this package that deals with more effectively law enforcement because we on this side of the chamber are concerned about what is happening in relation to federal crime and the capacity of our law enforcement bodies to combat such crime properly. We read in the press, for example, that the Minister has before him a report which has not been made public and which is being referred to as the Whyte report. It finds that the Federal Government's anti-crime policy is `uncoordinated, fragmented and lacking in vision'. I would have thought that in the context of legislation to improve Federal law enforcement the Parliament would be better informed if it had access to that report, and I would like to see it. I call upon the Minister to table that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report further goes on to criticise important bodies that have been built up in the law enforcement area. It criticises, apparently, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI). According to a press report, it casts grave doubts on the future of the ABCI, which was established in 1981. The ABCI was an attempt to coordinate police intelligence from around Australia, and all of us who take an interest in this subject know that one of the great difficulties has been bringing police intelligence into a central form that can be utilised in the national good, rather than simply being restrained within State boundaries. It is one of the reasons the National Crime Authority was set up. If there are now reports coming out of the Federal Government saying that that body is not functioning in the way it was designed to function, we should be advised as to what is going on in order that we can see legislation such as this in its correct context. Apparently the report went on to criticise the Australian Police Ministers Council. Again that Council is an attempt to coordinate police work around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is going on in this regard? I would be pleased if the Minister, when he brings law enforcement legislation such as this before us, could bring us properly into the picture. I do not want to dwell on it but we understand from press reports that the Whyte report reaches a conclusion that there has been no comprehensive attempt to estimate the dimensions, character, structure, trends or impact on Australian society of criminal activity. That would be most worrying if that were the case. </PARA>
<PARA> That draws us back to previous reports in this area that the Government has not been prepared to make public. The paper entitled `The cost of efficient policing', prepared by the former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Major-General Grey, and submitted to the then Special Minister of State in February 1985, and more importantly the paper entitled `Fraud on the Commonwealth', prepared jointly by the Department of the Special Minister of State and the Australian Federal Police at the request of the then Special Minister of State and submitted to him on 29 November 1985, have never been made public. What we do know is that the latter paper puts the cost of fraud on the Commonwealth at $4 billion-a figure that was denied, as a matter of interest, at the time of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say-and I always give Senator Tate credit when it is deserved-that at a recent State committee inquiry Senator Tate was prepared to give at least an assessment of those two papers, and that is now on the public record. Who made the assessment, of course, we do not know. It may have come out of the Minister's office. It says that we should not take that $4 billion too seriously, yet it is prepared to accept the accuracy of a number of the other findings in the report on fraud on the Commonwealth. Whoever made the assessment cannot have it both ways and say to us, `Take no notice of the $4 billion figure because more work needs to be done', yet say that in other ways the report is correct. For example it is apparently correct we see from the assessment, that we are failures in administration and coordination between the agencies. In fact, it says the relationship between the Australian Federal Police and other agencies has been allowed to develop in a `haphazard and uncoordinated way'. It seems to be similar wording to that which we now understand is contained within the Whyte report. </PARA>
<PARA> So, again, what is going on? We would like to be brought into the confidence of the Government because, after all, it is our responsibility as a Parliament to act if the Commonwealth is failing to meet its law enforcement responsibility. It is particularly worrying to me that whilst on the one hand the Government says, `Don't take any notice of the $4 billion fraud', it then goes on to say, `We don't think it is worth while finding out whether that is correct or not'. How can we develop the best mechanisms to meet a law enforcement problem if we are not prepared to analyse the nature or the extent of the problem. It seems to me on the basis of the little that we have before us that the Government has abrogated its responsibility in this area, and I look forward to the Government's response to the matters that I have put before the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA> In relation to the more general matters that have been raised, I believe that the Federal law enforcement agencies, pre-eminently amongst them the Australian Federal Police but also various joint agencies such as the National Crime Authority and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, are in very good order indeed. I believe that morale in the Australian Federal Police is at an all-time high. I certainly hope to confirm that at Christmas drinks with the Australian Federal Police Association later this afternoon, if I am allowed a quick pair with the indulgence of the chamber. It is a most rare event for me to so indulge but I believe that, having been through a rough patch with the Australian Federal Police Association early in the winter recess, we have now reached a situation where, as I could perhaps explain at greater length if I had more time, the relations between the Minister, the Department, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Federal Police Association are at an all-time high. Everybody knows that this Government has taken steps in the right direction, first of all with the appointment of Commissioner McAulay, with the various efforts that have been made in the industrial relations field, and in trying to target and focus the operations of the Federal Police in a way which gives to those entering the force in particular a fascinating career path which will enable them to get great job satisfaction out of combating organised crime, drug trafficking and major fraud against the Commonwealth. Because of all these things I believe that the Federal Police are now in a very good position to wage that particular battle which the community demands that the Federal law enforcement agency wages. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, it may be that I can further elaborate on this. I do not have the exact papers before me to which Senator Hill referred, but I made it quite clear at a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council on 25 November, once again in Queensland, that the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence certainly has my support. I know Senator Archer has always had a great interest in the operations of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. He is present in the chamber. In so far as the so-called Whyte report-that is an over-personalisation and dramatisation of what is an internal document, still in draft form and produced by officers-is said to have suggested that the Australian Federal Police absorb the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, which is the real purport of that paragraph in the article to which Senator Hill referred, I have made it abundantly clear to the Australian Police Ministers Council that that is just not in the mind of the Government at all. So Senator Hill should not believe everything he reads. I believe that the Federal law enforcement agencies are in a good position to wage the war that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in relation to fraud against the Commonwealth the various preliminary reports to which Senator Hill referred led to the setting up of a major exercise including, I think at the highest level, representatives from all relevant Commonwealth departments to come up with a strategy for combating fraud against the Commonwealth. I can tell Senator Hill and other honourable senators that that strategy is now already beginning to bear great fruit in the various agencies as they devise strategies and precautionary methods of preventing fraud against the Commonwealth arising, which must be the main in-principle aim, but then detecting it and effectively dealing with it should it unfortunately occur. So I believe that we are in good shape as far as the Federal fight against crime is concerned. I am pleased that the chamber is supporting the passage of this legislation. I also table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill. Once again it has to do with the excision of certain National Crime Authority matters into another Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988 is the second such amendment Bill to have come forward this year. It amends eight separate Acts with approximately 60 individual amendments or alterations. The Acts so affected are the Navigation Act 1912, the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, the Airlines Equipment Act 1958, the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, the Independent Air Fares Committee Act 1981, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986. The previous amending Bill amended five Acts-the Navigation Act 1912, the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952, The Federal Airports Corporation Act 1988, the Shipping Registration Act 1981 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Navigation Act amendments on this occasion give the Minister more powers and reduce recourse to the courts of marine inquiry for some of the matters referred to, passing them over to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal instead. The Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 amendments increase the size of eligible ships from 12 metres to 60 metres and separate cargo and passenger vessels by the creation of another section under `Definitions'. These are the main issues dealt with. There are about 50 other changes relating to errors, to the English used, to definition alterations, to commencement dates and so on. The number of alterations is quite horrifying and I expect that there should be less need for alteration than appears to be the case. Having said that, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all been very fortunate today to have several missives from our colleagues in Brazil come back to Australia. I am informed of the following: I am delighted to advise the Senate that the World Heritage Committee, meeting in Brasilia, today decided to inscribe the wet tropics of Queensland on the World Heritage List. The decision recognises the wet tropics as one of the most valuable tropical rainforests in the world. Mr Jim Thorsell, head of the evaluation team which examined the nomination, told the Committee in his official presentation that it was one of the best five nominations he had ever seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The World Heritage protection for the wet tropics is yet another milestone in the Hawke Government's impressive record on environmental protection. In deciding to inscribe the wet tropics on the World Heritage List, the World Heritage Committee clearly rejected the Queensland Government's position. The decision was unanimous; not one country took up the Queensland Government's case. The Queensland Government has had ample opportunity to put its case. Dr Thorsell's international evaluation team visited the wet tropics in April 1988 and discussed the nomination with the Queensland Premier, Ministers and officials. The State has ceaselessly lobbied World Heritage member countries and led expensive delegations to the June meeting of the World Heritage Bureau in Paris and the current Committee meeting in Brasilia. Millions of dollars that could have helped north Queenslanders have already been wasted by the Queensland Government. Surely even Queensland should now accept reality. It should put aside its differences with the Commonwealth and cooperate in the disbursement of the Commonwealth's $75m package for north Queensland. It should come to the table and discuss the future management arrangements and drop its unconstructive and expensive High Court of Australia challenge. To put it another way, we have been to the funeral, now let us have a reading of the will. World Heritage listing has brought international attention and better protection and management of the Great Barrier Reef. There is no reason why two governments cannot come together and similarly cooperate on arrangements for the rainforests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 November last the West Australian newspaper reported a speech given by the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Elliott, to a business dinner in Bunbury in Western Australia and stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Business lunches as a tax deduction will make a comeback under the next Federal Liberal Government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Elliott added that the Liberal scheme would allow for genuine expenses associated with the earning of income to be deductable but it would aim to eliminate rorts. Of course, that is a bit of cloud-cuckoo-land stuff because, short of sending an officer from the Australian Taxation Office to every business lunch to make sure the conversation does not stray too far away from business matters, it is impossible to reinstate deductability and eliminate rorts. The only practical way of eliminating what had grown into a giant rort is to deny the deduction.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Elliott's statement contradicts the statement made by Mr Howard and Mr Peacock on 10 May when they said, in the statement on `The Shape of the Coalition Tax Policy':</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Opposition recognises that many entertainment expenses are directly involved in earning assessable income, the priorities are such that we can no longer commit ourselves to a restoration of entertainment expenses as a tax deduction.</PARA>

If I may say so, the undertaking by Mr Elliott that the Liberal Government would restore the free tax deductable business lunch-or the rort as it degenerated into-is at considerable variance with the soft images of families and picket fences which the Liberal Party tried to convey last Sunday. The Government is not contemplating bringing back that rort. But, if we did, the likely cost of doing so would be about $400m a year.

I therefore ask the Minister: Is he aware that it has been alleged by several parties that senior officers of the Commonwealth Bank have in the past colluded in a corrupt practice by which businesses receiving funds from the Bank are deliberately manipulated into bankruptcy and that their businesses are then acquired by other predetermined parties? Is the Minister aware that it is further alleged that these allegations have, for several years, been known to the Federal Police and that the victims of these practices claim that the Federal Police has failed in its duties in these matters? Is the Minister aware that these matters are the subject of statements of claim filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales last Thursday, 1 December?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had some chance to consult with the Australian Federal Police, who inform me that it is currently investigating allegations that a senior officer of the Commonwealth Bank provided confidential information to individuals concerning outstanding debts by certain companies. It is alleged that those companies were then approached and offered funds which would enable them to continue trading and repay their debts. They would be converted to public companies and the majority shareholding would be controlled by the individuals who proposed the scheme. It is further alleged that the companies were unable to repay their debts and were stripped of their assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also been further informed by the Federal Police that these allegations were first reported to it in April 1988 and that it has been undertaking an investigation since that time.

The Australian Federal Police has further advised that it is aware of one document relating to these matters which was lodged by a plaintiff within the Supreme Court in March 1988.

Each of those committees conducts a monthly survey of prices in its immediate district. The surveys of prices are then compiled monthly and figures drawn from the prices are available both on a national and a regional basis. In a place such as Newcastle the price watch committee can monthly come up with a select basket of prices for that region and consumers are then able to compare prices available to them from one supermarket to the other in that region. The Government believes that the price watch network is a very important and effective tool in ensuring that consumers have relevant and adequate information on the cheapest place to shop at the most appropriate time, and that is before they actually go shopping.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not refer to the rumours, as they seem to have so upset Senator Puplick. No form of amendment to the affirmative action legislation is being considered. The affirmative action legislation was implemented in the time of my predecessor, Senator Susan Ryan, who did a great deal of work in consulting extensively with the public and companies. The legislation in its present form is in an excellent condition. That is best indicated by the fact that when reports for the first year were prepared and presented to the Minister responsible, about a month ago, they showed that there had been 99 per cent compliance with the affirmative action legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, you will probably recall the dire predictions that were made by a number of Opposition members when Senator Susan Ryan was taking the affirmative action legislation through the Parliament. It was criticised on the basis that companies would not comply with the legislation, that they would ignore it. Yet the Government's commitment to equal employment opportunity has been well and truly vindicated by the responsible way companies have responded. That augurs well for the second stage of the legislation's implementation, to come into effect next year.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Puplick will regard this as a rumour, and I have not yet had an opportunity to read the Future Directions document, but I have heard it said that the Affirmative Action Agency would be maintained by Mr Howard in the unlikely event he were to be in a position to make such a decision. His contribution to Human Rights Week was to announce that, if in government, he would dismantle the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-not a particularly appropriate way for a responsible Opposition Leader to begin Human Rights Week. Mr Howard has indicated that the Opposition is committed to equal opportunities for women. He maintains that equal opportunities are available to women in education and the workplace and that the treatment of women in Australia should be fair and equitable at all times.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that Mr Howard has given that commitment. But how he would ensure that those principles were implemented if he were in a position to live up to his promise to dismantle the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is beyond me. In answer to Senator Zakharov's question, the affirmative action legislation will not be amended. It would not be appropriate to apply the legislation to companies employing less than 100 people. We believe that the larger companies have the resources and the opportunity to set an example in this regard. Whether or not it was a rumour, I can assure Senator Zakharov that there is no move to change the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of companies which are integral to the Australian steel industry, such as Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, Palmer Tube Mills Ltd, Comsteel and some others, were in the province, as it were, of the steel plan. In terms of bounty assistance, investment and a whole range of activities associated with the Steel Industry Authority, those companies were beneficiaries of and participants in the steel plan. I will make some brief, practical comments about that. For example, of the $144m which the Government spent on the steel industry over the life of the plan, $82m went to 23 different non-BHP companies. As I have said, one of the best examples was Tubemakers. The Tubemakers plant at Newcastle reduced its work force during the life of the plan from 2,400 to 700 without a strike and without retrenchments. At the same time, it doubled, and in some areas trebled, productivity and invested over $80m in the latest plant and equipment. It is rapidly becoming a world leader in pipe and tube technology. At the same time, with the Steel Industry Authority, it developed plant level agreements which should be a model for the rest of the steel industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of other smaller firms and tube makers were involved in the steel plan, some of them highly entrepreneurial. They included Bunge Industrial Steels Pty Ltd, which exports most of its output of quenched and tempered steel to the United States; Palmer Tube Mills, which grew rapidly in the local market in spite of some difficulties from time to time with BHP and is now growing even more rapidly in the United States; and Smorgons, the Melbourne mini-mill which has captured a sizeable share of the Australian rod and bar market and is currently in a stage of further capacity expansion. All these firms emerged from the period of the steel plan leaner, more efficient and better placed to benefit from the booming domestic market. Present indications are for a very promising world steel market in the next year or so. There were other firms involved but I have mentioned some of the key ones.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that I speak on behalf of all honourable senators when I express the outrage we felt at the treatment of Mrs Sham-Ho. Anything that we can do at the Federal level to assist in that regard we will. The protection of speakers at public meetings in New South Wales is the responsibility of the State Government at this stage. Given that State Government's commitment to multiculturalism, obviously it will provide the necessary degree of protection in future. It is true that one would be more likely to have to seek protection in certain areas of Australia because of extremist groups. I think it is provided in South Australia. I have not availed myself of it yet, but it is provided to Ministers going to South Australia. Sometimes there is a problem in Western Australia, where similar activities have broken out, and now these extremists are active in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all have a responsibility to condemn political extremism. I feel comfortable in doing that because all my life I have condemned political extremism, either of the extreme Left or the extreme Right, especially when it manifests itself in violence and threats. Mrs Sham-Ho was treated shamefully at that meeting, and I believe that every protection possible should be accorded to her.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The transfer of these airports to the FAC is taking longer than was originally anticipated. We very much regret that delay but it has been caused by a number of quite complex issues which are taking additional time to resolve. They are essentially threefold. The first is the need to finalise an agreed valuation which provides an appropriate basis for future FAC pricing and investment decisions. I understand that that matter is very close to settlement. Secondly, there is a need to determine appropriate tenure arrangements on the joint user aerodromes which are shared with the Department of Defence. That has taken much longer to resolve for reasons which even Senator MacGibbon may be deeply appreciative of. The problem is that when we have a shared facility, as is Darwin Airport, we have to deal with the defence interests involved. Given the significance and importance of that from the national security point of view, it is important to get the tenure arrangements right, and that has taken some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is a need in due course to amend the Federal Airports Corporation Act to permit the FAC to operate Federal airports under leasehold from the Commonwealth and to develop arrangements, again, for joint operations on aerodromes shared with Defence. That is the other side of the coin which I have just mentioned. The FAC, for its part, has to establish the necessary management arrangements to accommodate a significant increase in the number of airports under its control, but that is something for which arrangements, I understand, are well in hand. It is now expected that the transfers will take place in the early part of 1989. There need be no concern whatsoever about the fact that the transfers will take place. The problem has just been one of timing, for the reasons I hope I have sufficiently and clearly indicated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of certain reports that the Western Australian Government, in the guise of the Minister for Police in that jurisdiction, has decided to support in financial terms the efforts by the police union-I just cannot recall its exact title-to challenge the exercise of powers by the member of the Royal Commission who has been allocated certain tasks by Mr Justice Muirhead in relation to the Aboriginal deaths in custody which have occurred in Western Australia. I regard it as a matter of regret that the Western Australian Government has reached a point where it has decided to support an attempt to frustrate the inquiries which have been undertaken, as the honourable senator has said, in accordance with the very references which both the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments have agreed should be the subject of the Royal Commission's inquiries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I think we ought not to anticipate events over the next few weeks because, as I understand it, Mr Justice Muirhead will be presenting to governments an interim report by the end of this year which will indicate certain preliminary findings as to the steps which might be taken to prevent the further occurrence of these tragic deaths in custody. I think a great cause of frustration, perhaps in the general community and even amongst honourable senators, is the fact that, at one stage, the Royal Commission looked as though it would go on for a very long time without any indication coming from its deliberations to this point as to what practical steps might be taken to prevent the recurrence of these deaths in custody. In so far as the Commission, through its various inquiries, has come to any conclusions which might be of use, I believe that governments need to be made aware of them as soon as possible. I believe that the Western Australian Government is anxious that those deaths in custody do not occur at the rate at which, tragically, they have occurred over recent years. I believe also from certain press reports-I have not been able to confirm this-that Mr Justice Muirhead intends to bring down findings in respect of certain cases which have already been the subject of inquiry within the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, I believe that, upon the receipt of the interim report from Mr Justice Muirhead, governments will be in a much better position to decide whether the sort of action being contemplated by the Western Australian Minister for Police is justified. I would hope that the interim report, carefully considered by governments, will enable the Commission to have the confidence of all participating jurisdictions so that the tragic deaths which have occurred, having been properly examined, can be finally regarded as having been inquired into in a way which satisfies in particular the families but also the general community and that the lessons learnt from those experiences can be applied to prevent the recurrence of these tragedies.</PARA>

The honourable senator raised a couple of other general questions about the propriety of people working for government, then going off into some private sphere and using that training and knowledge and profiting from it. If it occurs it would not be limited only to defence; it would occur in areas such as communications and right across the board. One of the reasons governments have this difficulty-I think most Ministers acknowledge it-is that many employees who are working in the Public Service are not paid the market rate; therefore, they are quite tempted to leave. Some retire early and become journalists and later senators. There is a whole range of people.

I would have to say that it did not enthuse everyone in New South Wales when he sent the submarine contract to South Australia. Whenever he makes a decision about a frigate there will be people who whinge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to assert that there is nothing really contradictory in the statements of Senator Ryan and Senator Richardson. The processes of environmental impact assessment, in accordance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, were fully satisfied in the case of the Christmas Island casino. After the proponent was designated, the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and Environment required sufficient information to determine whether an environmental impact statement was necessary. Following extensive consultations between the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Territories and the proponent, the Department secured the proponent's agreement to a series of environmental protection measures which address the potential impacts of the proposal on the island's natural and socioeconomic environment. These undertakings have also been incorporated in the agreement between the Commonwealth and Christmas Island Casino Resort Pty Ltd. On the basis of these undertakings and the Department's assessment, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment concluded that an environmental impact statement would not be required for the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to the honourable senator's specific question: firstly, in accordance with the procedures under the Act, the proponent is responsible for preparing the environmental assessment documentation. The Department, on behalf of the Minister, provides guidance and an audit of these documents. Secondly-and this follows from what I have just said-the Government does not normally commission independent assessments of specific impacts except, of course, where it is the proponent. However, in this case, the then Department of Arts Heritage and Environment had before it information from the Department of Territories and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist in examining the environmental issues associated with the proponent's project. The then Department of Territories identified two main areas of concern: firstly, the potential effect of the increased visitor numbers on the national park and other sensitive natural areas; and, secondly, the potential effects on the island's social and economic structure arising from the shift to a tourism based economy, changes in the type and availability of employment and other associated changes in island administration.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service also expressed concern on the first of these matters. On the basis of this advice and on its own assessment, the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment concluded that the most effective way to protect the island's natural and social environment would be to secure the proponent's agreement to a series of broad environmental protection measures. These measures were documented, referred to the developer and his agreement obtained. Thirdly, as a result of an agreement to those environmental protection measures and in accordance with the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the Minister then determined that an environmental impact statement was not necessary for achieving the object of the impact of proposals Act. Fourthly, the honourable senator asked whether I would table the environmental impact statement or the equivalent document. The relevant document which I have referred to is the environment protection undertakings that the developer has agreed to. I table the document.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article; indeed, I have a copy of it with me. It is pretty clear that it is a call, in short, from Mr Olsen for the Government to extend cheap finance to every small business on the west coast because he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Predominantly, small business income is related to farming.</PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, this view has been seriously challenged by the University of New South Wales in some recent research which has shown that in the Riverina-I have forgotten precisely what town it was-during the rural slump of the early 1980s small businesses were doing better than they had done before. Of course, anecdotal evidence of that type has been around for a long time. I recall that in a Western Australian country town during the agricultural slump of the early 1970s one local businessman was reported as saying that his trade had gone up since the slump because the farmers could not afford to do their shopping in Perth any more and they were doing it in the local country town. Leaving that aside, Mr Olsen continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The drought affected season has meant turnover has dropped with people buying less, only the essentials.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that Mr Olsen himself was once a small businessman from those sorts of areas. The natural disaster relief arrangements do not provide for this kind of assistance to small business. As I understand it, the South Australian Government has the good sense to address more fundamental problems than that, particularly securing a suitable restructuring of agriculture through the rural adjustment scheme (RAS).</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia was saying that this was not enough and that as South Australia's carry-on loan budget had been exhausted, there was a need for an immediate injection of at least $1m from the Commonwealth into South Australia. Whether Mr Olsen is aware of that promise by his Federal counterpart-that is, the additional $1m for the Eyre Peninsula-I do not know.</PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday, in response to a challenge from the Treasurer and me, Mr Peacock and Dr Hewson issued a list, incomplete though it was, clarifying their position on a number of expenditure promises from which they had dumped a huge amount-over $12 billion in total-of commitments that had been given by various people purporting to speak for the Opposition, most spectacularly of all by Mr Sinclair and Mr White in the defence area. Among those commitments was a reference to $1.8m for the RAS on South Australia's west coast. They put out a document in which they said:</PARA>
<PARA>the call for $1 million to be provided for these purposes was made last financial year and is no longer relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>Or, as Ronald Ziegler used to say, it is `inoperative'. If Mr Olsen really believes this assistance is necessary I suggest that he commence by talking to his Federal counterparts, who explicitly walked away from the commitment which they had previously made to do just that.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 November 1988, Senator Teague asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, a question without notice regarding reports that consideration is being given to changing International Labour Organisation (ILO) rules in respect of the Director-General's term of office. Senator Teague asked what will be the attitude of the Australian Government representatives at the ILO to such changes, are they being actively sought by the Australian Government and who was responsible for initiating the move to change the rules. In my reply, I undertook to refer the matter to the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Minister has provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The term office of the Director-General of the ILO expires on 26 February 1989. In accordance with previous practice the tripartite ILO Governing Body considered a report prepared by its officers at its June 1988 meeting on the necessary measures in anticipation of this expiry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government Body decided to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) amend the Staff Regulations, reducing the period of appointment from ten to five years. The ten year provision has not applied since 1948 and is considered obsolete and inappropriate. This brings the period of appointment of the ILO Director- General into line with the Appointments of the heads of a number of United Nations agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) adopt a requirement that to be elected a candidate should receive the votes of more than one-half of the members of the Governing Body entitled to vote. This requirement was introduced in light of the Governing Body's expectation that for the first time there will be more than two candidates standing for the position of Director-General. The Standing Orders of the Governing Body did not set down specific conditions and, according to accepted practice, the Director-General could be elected by a simple majority of votes cast (abstentions excluded). The Governing Body took the view that it is essential for the Director-General to enjoy the broadest possible support within the Governing Body in order to fully carry out the important functions of the position. The previous practice did not seem to provide an adequate guarantee in this respect. The Governing Body adopted this change by consensus. The changes were not sought by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The election of the Director-General will be held on 13 February 1989. The Governing Body will meet in private sitting in order to proceed to take a vote by secret ballot.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone asked me a question yesterday as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs about an article by Father Frank Brennan in the Catholic Leader of 4 December 1988 concerning the Yarrabah Aboriginal community in north Queensland. Honourable senators will recall that most of the matters were directed actually to the responsibilities of Senator Richardson. I am advised that the allegations raised by Senator Stone about Senator Richardson's dealings with the Yarrabah Aboriginal community are totally false.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by Senator Richardson's office that the Yarrabah Aboriginal community has been, in fact, extensively consulted by the Federal Government about the World Heritage nomination of the wet tropics of Queensland. Senator Richardson met with the Chairman of the Yarrabah Community Council in Cairns in September 1987 and with the entire Council in Canberra in October 1988. He has written not once but three times to the Council Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, officers of the Federal Government's Cairns rainforest unit have visited Yarrabah to discuss World Heritage listing on four occasions.

<PARA>The Editor</PARA>

<PARA>FORTITUDE VALLEY QLD 4006</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed with the number of inaccuracies contained in Fr Frank Brennan's front page article in the Catholic Leader of 4 December. Despite the impression conveyed by the article, the Yarrabah Aboriginal Community in North Queensland has been extensively consulted by the Federal Government about the World Heritage nomination of the Wet Tropics of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> Fr Brennan implies that I have somehow ignored the Yarrabah community or refused to allow them to put their case. Nothing could be further from the truth. I met with the Chairman of the Yarrabah Community Council (with other Aboriginal leaders) in Cairns on 3 September 1987 and with the full Council in Canberra on 18 October 1988. I have written three letters setting out in some detail the implications of listing for the community. Officers of the Federal Government's Cairns Rainforest Unit have visited Yarrabah for consultations on 4 occasions. Another 3 meetings have been held in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these formal meetings, there have been numerous telephone discussions between officers of the Rainforest Unit and representatives of the Yarrabah community. Other representatives of the Federal Government such as Mr John Gayler MP, Member for Leichhardt, and staff of the Minister for Local Government, Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds, have also visited Yarrabah to discuss the World Heritage nomination.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1988 the Federal Government organised and paid for a visit to the Northern Territory by members of Yarrabah and other North Queensland Aboriginal communities for consultations with Aboriginals from Uluru and Kakadu National Parks. Both those national parks are inscribed on the World Heritage List. All of Uluru National Park is Aboriginal land. About one third of Kakadu National Park is Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA> These matters have been acknowledged by the Yarrabah community. The Council Chairman wrote to me on 28 June 1988 that ``we have had continuing discussions with Commonwealth . . . officials''.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that I have not been to Yarrabah itself. However, I had arranged to visit on 8 August 1988 but the visit was cancelled because members of the Council were not available to meet with me. A planned visit in July 1988 by members of my personal staff was also cancelled when my staff were advised that the Council was interested only in talking with me.</PARA>
<PARA> Fr Brennan is not correct in implying that the Federal Government made an error in including Yarrabah land. It is also not correct to imply that the Yarrabah Aboriginal community has been treated differently from other private landowners. It is true that I announced in November 1987 that private land within the nominated area would be kept to a minimum. However, private blocks which were essential to the integrity of the nomination had to be included. Thus, in my letter to the Yarrabah Council Chairman of 23 November 1988, I explained that it would be inappropriate to delete some of the finest and least represented rainforest (i.e. the Yarrabah rainforest) from the nomination. Exactly the same situation applies to 131 freehold blocks elsewhere in the nominated area.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is nothing unusual about people living and working in a World Heritage Area. Apart from Uluru and Kakadu National Parks which support viable Aboriginal communities as well as a thriving tourism industry, Australians live and work on the Great Barrier Reef, the Willandra Lakes region of NSW and Lord Howe Island, all of which are on the World Heritage List. A wide range of activities are undertaken in World Heritage areas in other countries, such as the Rocky Mountains in Canada which includes towns and farming communities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Yarrabah Aboriginal community has been given a number of assurances about the implications of World Heritage listing. On 22 January 1988, I wrote to the Council Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA>``I assure all Aboriginal communities who have land included in the listing that, provided World Heritage values are not unduly compromised, there is no intention to restrict traditional activities.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the Federal Government will not limit the traditional use of or access to these forests by Aboriginal people. The use of forest resources for the manufacture of artefacts or for traditional purposes can continue. In addition, activities such as hunting and food gathering will not be stopped.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that Yarrabah has a small sawmilling operation for supplying timber to the community. I wish to assure you that the activities of your mill will not be affected by the listing.</PARA>
<PARA>Kakadu National Park is one example where World Heritage listing has brought benefits to local aboriginal people. I believe your community will also discover that World Heritage will give you a better chance of both protecting and developing your land in accordance with the wishes of your people.</PARA>
<PARA>I assure you any rights that your community has so recently gained with the Queensland Government's Deed of Grant in Trust legislation will not be diminished or compromised. Indeed, World Heritage should give you even greater and more secure control over your lands.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government hopes to develop co-operatively with the Queensland Government appropriate management for the region. This will involve certain employment initiatives and regional development proposals in keeping with the World Heritage values of the area. I would be more than willing to discuss any such proposals your community may wish to put forward in conjunction with other relevant Federal and State Departments.''</PARA>
<PARA> These assurances were honoured in January 1988 when regulations to prevent logging in the nominated World Heritage Area were promulgated. The regulations contained a specific provision exempting Aboriginal people. Similarly, other private landowners are permitted to continue using timber from their own land for non-commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also given assurances to the Yarrabah community that World Heritage listing will not mean control of their land passing to the Federal government. On 23 November 1988 I wrote to the Council Chairman that ``Aboriginal communities will play an important role, not only in World Heritage matters concerning their own land, but also in the management of the whole area.''</PARA>
<PARA> On 28 November 1988 I reiterated this assurance in another letter to the Council Chairman noting that ``the management of the Wet Tropics will continue to recognise existing authorities within the area''. I said ``As the responsible authority, the Yarrabah Community Council will continue to have prime carriage of all matters related to Yarrabah''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is determined not only that Aboriginal people will have a significant role to play in the future management of the Wet Tropics but that World Heritage listing will provide increased benefits and opportunities for Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> As a final observation, I would note that it is unfortunate the Yarrabah community has had so much blatant pressure put on it for purely political reasons by the Queensland Government to oppose World Heritage Listing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's commitment to World Heritage and Aboriginal aspirations is clearly demonstrated at Kakadu and Uluru. I believe the Wet Tropics will be a similar success.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Senate was provided with a series of documents by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). These related, first, to the Government's response to the FitzGerald inquiry report, entitled Immigration-A Commitment to Australia, the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies; secondly, with a number of press releases which give further details of the Government's response to the FitzGerald inquiry; thirdly, with a table providing the outline of the Government's response to 73 recommendations of the FitzGerald inquiry; and finally, a statement on the question of criminal deportation the Government has put down relating to a number of matters affecting the way in which the Government believes matters of criminal deportation should be handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will start my remarks by dealing with the question of criminal deportation. On behalf of the Opposition I wish to indicate simply that we understand the purpose for which the Government has made this statement. It is in order to provide a guidance to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the Federal Court of Australia under the new provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act about the interpretations which these bodies should bring to bear in dealing with the question of potentially overturning ministerial deportation orders and the extent to which they should have greater regard to the policy determinations of the Government in criminal deportation matters. The statement primarily indicates that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court should take into account two particular matters which they may not have emphasised sufficiently in their judgments in the past. The first of these is the extent to which they should have regard to the total criminal history of the person who has been designated as the recipient of the deportation order. The second is the extent to which they should have particular regard to the importance which the Government and indeed the Opposition attach to the significance of deportation orders which involve people who have been convicted for trafficking in illicit drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition I say that we believe it is a perfectly proper practice for the Government to indicate to judicial authorities the outline of government policy which should be borne in mind when making these determinations. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, following changes made some years ago to the Acts Interpretation Act, the courts and judicial authorities are to have regard to certain government policy statements. We think this is a proper way in which the Government should go about advising the courts of its policy parameters. The Opposition certainly endorses the view that the total criminal history of people who are the subject of deportation orders ought to be borne in mind by the courts. We share the Government's view of the significance which is attached to the fight against trafficking in illicit drugs. Therefore, we have no difficulties with the statement put down by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethic Affairs dealing with the question of criminal deportation. As a result it is not my intention to spend any further time dealing with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The main thrust of Senator Ray's comments today dealt with the so-called FitzGerald report. The Opposition shares with the Minister a feeling of appreciation to Dr Stephen FitzGerald and the members of his Committee for having produced this extremely important report. The FitzGerald report has opened public debate on one of the great sacred cows of Australian politics, namely, our immigration policy. Since the end of the Second World War immigration policies have occupied a central place in public policy in Australia. However, in recent years the Australian Labor Party has undertaken a series of exercises in social engineering under the guise of changes in immigration policy which for various reasons it has sought to conceal from public debate in Australia. The important thing about the FitzGerald inquiry is that it has put back on the public agenda discussion about immigration policy. That is a very significant contribution in itself. The nature of Australian society is profoundly changed, profoundly shaped by changes in immigration policy. The people of Australia are entitled to know what the Government is doing, what the Government is seeking to achieve, and to have the opportunity to express a view as to whether they approve or disapprove of what the Government is doing. This is a very important issue for everybody in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the FitzGerald inquiry has opened this area up for renewed public debate it has rendered a very important service to the people of Australia. It is perhaps a pity that a great deal of the subsequent public debate about the FitzGerald inquiry or its recommendations has been manifestly uninformed. I look, for example, at an article which appeared in the August-September 1988 journal Migration. It refers to comments by Mr Tony Bonnici, a member of the FitzGerald committee. At that stage Mr Bonnici was still the senior Deputy Chairman of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia. In that article he is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bonnici said FECCA-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>and the ethnic communities had failed to look at the report, and the immigration issues involved, from the wider national perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely prescient and very important comment. To a very large extent a great deal of the debate about the FitzGerald inquiry has been ill-informed and based on the prejudices of people who have not only not read the preliminary document but who have also not read the model Bill presented as volume 2 of the inquiry and the papers contained in volume 3, which are papers of a consultative nature which are very important in understanding the broad background from which the FitzGerald inquiry moved towards the production of its final report. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I want to make is perhaps the most important in some respects. I believe it is a great pity that given the choice between a response which really responds to Australia's national interest, the course of action we know Senator Ray favoured, and a response based primarily upon the promotion of the Labor Party's sordid and narrow political interests, the response Dr Theophanous, the honourable member for Calwell, and the Caucus immigration committee favoured, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) decided to lend his weight to the latter. This response in fact has indicated the extent to which the Prime Minister personally has capitulated to the demands of the left wing of the Labor Party, to put section before nation, to put division before harmony, and, above all, to put party interest before principle. It is a continuing capitulation of the Prime Minister to the demands of the left wing of the Labor Party, this time in immigration, in exactly the same way as he has capitulated to the demands of the left wing in the debate on Aboriginal affairs and as he has nailed his colours to the mast of his left wing Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, rather than endorsing the rational, sensible view which spokesmen for the Labor Party such as Senator McMullan and Senator Collins might otherwise have advocated. It is above all a capitulation to the left wing of the Labor Party as part of the Prime Minister's agenda to shaft Mr Keating and to ensure that the debate within the Australian Labor Party over its leadership moves in a particular direction. It is a great shame that, just as in Aboriginal affairs, so it is in immigration: the Prime Minister has embarked upon a course of division, a course of the promotion of the Labor Party's sectional interests, and a clear determination to avoid giving a commitment which responds to the real necessity to provide a balanced policy which serves the national interest of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the most important single statement in the matrix provide to indicate the response of the Government to the FitzGerald inquiry recommendations. The Government has decided to reject the central thrust of the FitzGerald recommendations-namely, that immigration policy and selection criteria be changed so as to reflect a great weighting upon skills and up the promotion of a skill component within the immigration intake. Regarding recommendation No. 49 in the matrix document, the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> That the highest weightings go to the skills and entrepreneurship factors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted: alternative points system adopted on basis of advice of National Population Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental thrust of the FitzGerald inquiry, that immigration policy should be changed so as to reflect a greater priority for the introduction of skills within the migration component, has been centrally addressed and fundamentally rejected by the Australian Labor Party. That is a gross long term betrayal of the real interests of the Australian community. Nothing could be more important for Australia than the improvement of the skills of our population, whether it happens to be in the terms of the people coming here as migrants or the people who are born, educated and trained here and who will have to contend with the position that Australia finds itself in during the latter part of this century and the early part of the next. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental requirement for Australia to improve its skills, thereby improving its productivity, thereby improving its living standards, has been fundamentally addressed by the FitzGerald inquiry and has been absolutely rejected by the Australian Labor Party. That is a tragedy. It is a betrayal. It is a long term undermining of Australia's capacity to exist, to compete and to prosper in the world of the twenty-first century. This Government will stand fundamentally condemned for its failure to adopt that recommendation of the FitzGerald inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps interesting to look now in detail at the Minister's statement, which was tabled this morning, particularly at a number of parts of that statement which essentially endorse what the Opposition has been saying about social policy and migration policy in Australia. Let me turn first to to the statement on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of social goals, Australia supports the concept of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is absolutely central to what Mr Howard and the Opposition have been saying in our manifesto. Future Directions. The Prime Minister, in Fremantle and elsewhere, has been making statements designed to denigrate, to debase and to debauch Mr Howard's statements about the importance of the family unit. Mr Hawke has, at every stage, attempted to ridicule Mr Howard's comments about the centrality of the family to Australian social policy. We have seen the Prime Minister on television in the West making disparaging and negative comments about the Liberal and National parties' emphasis upon the family as the central unit of Australian society and the central point of Australian social policy. Yet here we have, in Senator Ray's document, a clear and unequivocal statement that Mr Howard is absolutely correct in describing the concept of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I turn to page 2 of Senator Ray's statement. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of multiculturalism was not central to the report-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the FitzGerald report-</PARA>
<PARA>and the subsequent attention afforded to it did not add to the community's understanding of the issue and was at some cost to informed debate on the core immigration issues in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not accepted by the Opposition as a correct statement because that is predicated upon the Government's failure to state the clear intended outcome of immigration policy in this country. We say: Multiculturalism, although not integral to the way in which one constructs an immigration or migrant selection policy, is nevertheless of vital importance because it is important to lay down what a government expects to achieve for Australian society as an outcome of its immigration policy. One cannot have a coherent immigration policy without setting out clearly the outcomes and the goals of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Liberal and National parties describe their immigration policy as being based on the concept of being one nation, one Australia-to use Mr Howard's phrase-that indicates precisely that we on this side of the chamber have a coherent view about the outcome of immigration policy as distinct from simply a series of disaggregated policy initiatives which this Government has pursued. The Minister, on page 2 of his statement, says:</PARA>
<PARA>As a quite separate domestic policy, multiculturalism seeks to ensure that those born in Australia and those who migrated to Australia are equally accorded their rights. </PARA>
<PARA>We make it perfectly clear in paragraph 1.3 in the preamble to the Liberal and National parties' published immigration policy:</PARA>
<PARA>All of the policies of the Liberal and National Parties are based upon respect for the value of each individual. We are totally committed to equal treatment and equal opportunity for all Australians regardless of race, colour, creed or country of origin within the framework of a just and tolerant society. </PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Howard was interviewed on 26 August 1988 he said that there was no doubt:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all of the policies of the Liberal and National Parties were based upon the proposition that all Australians, irrespective of ethnic, racial or cultural background were entitled to complete equality of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>In that respect the statement put down today by Senator Robert Ray endorses not only Mr Howard's view about the central role of the family in Australian society but also Mr Howard's and the Opposition's view about the complete equality of treatment to be accorded to people within the wider concept of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to page 5 of the Minister's statement. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the Committee's message that immigration is for all Australians and that it should be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the chamber have consistently made precisely that point. Immigration policy should not be designed to favour one group, one section, or one community; it should be designed to favour all Australians, and it should be in the national interest. That is the third important element of the Opposition's immigration policy which Senator Ray's statement today clearly indicates the Government and, indeed, the community accept as entirely valid. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the short time which is available to us today to debate this important statement I will make only one or two other comments. The first concerns the mischievous comment made by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in his statement when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is regrettable that the Opposition sought to exploit this issue in the course of the Government's deliberations on the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>That lie was nailed by a member of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, who was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 August 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, said that he was ``disgusted'' with the way the Government had manipulated the immigration debate, and laid much of the blame on the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody has sought to exploit ethnic differences and tensions within this community more thoroughly, more comprehensively or more widely or cynically than has the Prime Minister and members of his Party. I exclude from this Senator Ray. He has attempted to get some rationality into this debate. He has at the end of the day been comprehensively rolled by Dr Theophanous and the Caucus immigration committee. His view about the balance of skill and family reunion migration, about the direction of policy, which he had put up to Cabinet, did not prevail. The reason it did not prevail in Cabinet was that the Prime Minister and his acolytes decided that the sordid misuse of immigration policy by Dr Theophanous and people who take his view of the future of Australian society should be preferred to the rational and sensible views being advanced by the Minister responsible for immigration, Senator Robert Ray. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the next part of the Minister's statement and commend him for a number of the initiatives which he has managed to get through Cabinet. I commend him for having decided to maintain the grant of resident status policy rather than subsume that within the wider immigration policy as was recommended by the FitzGerald inquiry. I congratulate him on having maintained the degree of ministerial discretion which he has sought to maintain and which we think is appropriate for a Minister to exercise on behalf of the Australian community. However, I direct a question to Senator Robert Ray which I hope that during the debate he or a spokesman for the Labor Party will seek to address. The Minister says that he will remove himself from an overview of the recommendations made under the second level appeal on immigration cases by whatever it is that is to replace the Immigration Review Panel (IRP). The Minister says in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> I shall also retain a general statutory power to override any decision of the review panel which, while consistent with the regulations, acts against the interests of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Minister says, `If a negative decision is made by the immigration review panel in relation to any individual, I retain the right to overrule that'. I ask the Government and the Minister: If the immigration review panel agrees to permit a person to come to Australia will the Minister reserve to himself the right to overturn that recommendation in the national interest? The Minister makes it clear that if the IRP or its equivalent recommends against an individual the Minister may review that decision. </PARA>

If the immigration review panel rules in favour of an applicant, will the Minister reserve to himself the right to overturn the positive decision? In other words, will he reserve the right to say, `The panel has recommended that the individual should come to Australia. I overturn that decision because it is in the national interest to do so.'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And indeed be tabled. But the Minister's statement is simply not clear on that matter and I am asking for clarification. We also express some concern about the Bureau of Immigration Research. This body is to be funded and in a full year its cost to the taxpayer will be about $4m. It will have a staff of 41. We hope that it will focus primarily upon the question of research and upon the question of commissioning research. To the extent that it may become simply a tool to promote the immigration policies of the government of the day as distinct from commissioning research and dealing with objective questions, we are concerned about it. Whether it becomes the Department's version of a National Media Liaison Service is an important question because if it fulfils the former role, that is, as a research body, it ought to be supported. If, however, it simply becomes a tool of propaganda on behalf of the specific political policies of the day, the Opposition has very considerable concerns about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is perfectly relaxed about matters such as the process of mandatory deportation in certain circumstances. It believes that that will be a significant improvement in light of the uncertainties which exist and which were drawn to the Senate's attention yesterday in the Minister's discussion of the case of Mr Kurtovik. We believe that the problems which the Minister identified yesterday need to be overcome and that the system which the Minister is proposing as far as that is concerned is perfectly acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of my colleagues wish to speak on this matter, and unfortunately our time today is restricted. I make only one other point. I express some degree of disappointment that the Government has decided that the important question of the recognition of overseas qualifications should be referred to yet another committee-on this occasion the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet. In light of the fact that the Fry Committee of Inquiry into the Recognition of Overseas Qualifications reported in December 1982, and the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications reported fairly recently, I think we ought to be getting some positive determinations and decisions rather than giving a reference to yet another committee to look at what is a very important question. The Fry Committee laid down a number of guidelines and made a number of recommendations, some of which have been acted upon, others of which have been reported upon by the Council on Overseas Professional Qualifications. It is a pity that six or so years down the track from the Fry Committee their recommendations are being sent off to yet another committee, this time a Cabinet committee. This is an area which requires some firm determination and decision making. The Opposition believes it is a pity that it has not been addressed more comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other important issues which arise in the field of immigration. I just draw attention to two papers of some importance. One paper by Paolo Totaro, entitled `Prejudice and Social Cohesion' was presented to the Italians in Australia Conference in Wollongong earlier this year. The other was presented by Arlene D'Mello, Coordinator of the Victorian Cooperative on Children's Services for Ethnic Groups, entitled `Is There Something Wrong With the Australian Immigration Program? Both papers bear study by honourable senators. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table those two papers as I do not have time to discuss them. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Immigration is a critical national issue. The nature of Australian society is profoundly shaped by its immigration policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to start by congratulating the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) on his statement, which I believe strikes the correct balance between the conflicting social, economic and humanitarian pressures that everybody is under in resolving questions about immigration and ethnic affairs. I had promised my colleagues that I would be on my best behaviour today and that I would comment only on the substance of the issues and not be at all provocative. However, I do feel that I must respond to some of the things said by Senator Puplick and will try to so so in my least provocative manner. I have also indicated, in the interests of the management of the business of the Senate, that I will try to keep my remarks relatively brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The party political remarks made by Senator Puplick early in his speech reminded me of a book I once bought for my young daughter before the school holidays. It was called What to do when there's nothing to do. The first part of Senator Puplick's speech sounded like `what to say when you have nothing to say'. He really was somewhat desperate. I have known the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, a very long time and know him perhaps as well as anybody else in the Senate. I have heard the Prime Minister accused of a lot of things, some of which I have agreed with and some I have not. I have never heard him accused of being `a captive of the Left'. I actually thought I was going to be ill I was laughing so much when Senator Puplick said that. It is so hysterically wrong when people look for conspiracy theories to explain other people's actions. All it tells one is what determines their own actions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other comments that Senator Puplick made to which I wish to respond. Firstly, Senator Puplick talked about the Government attempting to conceal its actions in the area of immigration and that, therefore, it was a good thing that the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies had come down to open up the debate. It made me wonder who had initiated the FitzGerald Committee report. I had to have a rethink because I have always thought that the Government had initiated it and that we opened up the debate. I had a quick rethink, I had a look at the report, and I found that I am right and that Senator Puplick is wrong. It was just an attempt to tie in the absurd allegations of the `Back to the Future' document about social engineering, so he had to make something up to give it a link. That was also the justification for the absurd and absolutely incorrect remarks he made in relation to the statement on page 4 of the Minister's statement concerning the concept of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society. Senator Ray's statement is correct and it is a statement shared by most people, whether they are members of such families or not. Even if they are not, they certainly accept that the majority of Australians see the family as the predominant group unit of social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, to contend that the Prime Minister in any way ridiculed that concept is either a gross misunderstanding of the English language or a deliberate attempt to mislead. What the Prime Minister was doing in the speech in Fremantle, in response to the `Back to the Future' document, was saying that the actions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) are in direct contradiction to his advocated concerns. He pretends, feigns, concern about the living standards of ordinary Australians, but everything he says and does entirely contradicts it. It is in no way a contradiction, with concern for the family, to say that someone else who cries crocodile tears does not have that concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter to which Senator Puplick referred, and to which I wish to respond briefly, was his breathtaking allegation that in the area of immigration the Government was concerned with division before harmony. That the Government in the political debate in Australia should be accused of engineering division in society in the area of immigration only means that Senator Puplick, in his very busy role in environment and the arts, has not had much time to examine what has been happening in Australia or even in the Liberal Party in his own State about the issues of immigration and about whom Liberal Party State members of parliament in his own State hold responsible for that division. It is certainly not the Australian Labor Party or the Prime Minister; it is the Leader of the Opposition and quite properly so. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the last point. This is not something that Senator Puplick said; this is something that he did not say. I listened very carefully for half an hour and he said nothing about the principles of non-discrimination in immigration. I do not blame him. I am sure, in his own way, he is privately committed to the principle that immigration in Australia should remain non-discriminatory. But he has said not one word about that very important and fundamental issue because he knows that the statement of the Leader of the Opposition, from which he has refused to resile, that Asian immigration should be slowed cannot be got around. I will be interested in any comments Senator Panizza might like to make to enhance the wonderful and enlightened remarks that he made in Esperance about Asian migrants while I was, unfortunately, in Asia. My concern is that the Leader of the Opposition has said, and he has refused to resile from it, that we need to slow down Asian immigration, in either a blatant or a misconceived attempt to facilitate the excesses of those involved in the extreme debate on anti-Asian immigration in Australia. It is a tragedy that that statement goes uncorrected. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to come back now to the substance of the statement before us. It strikes the correct balance between the conflicting social, economic and humanitarian pressures which confront decision makers in this area. If I wanted to summarise it, it is essentially an Australian policy. It fits within the broader strategy and framework of Government economic, social and foreign policy over the next few years. It is important that it is seen within that strategic framework. It is not a statement in isolation; it is a statement within a framework of a government which has a vision of Australia towards which it is working. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate on three areas of the reforms outlined in the statement-those with economic implications, the administrative reforms and what I have summarised as the political and humanitarian aspects-and then reflect briefly, if time permits, on what steps might follow these reforms. Before I do so, I want to join with Senator Puplick-I have disagreed with him on a few things-in congratulating those involved in the FitzGerald Committee for the work that they did. It is a pity that it has been misunderstood, particularly with regard to multiculturalism. The Committee said correctly that the community did not understand that issue. That misunderstanding has been compounded in the debate subsequently, particularly by the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition. The Committee pointed out correctly the problems of the increasing median age of people coming to Australia, of the declining skill level and of the questions about economic focus. That has led to the broad thrust of these reforms without throwing out the benefits of the existing systems and mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn, firstly, to the question of business migration. I think there is bipartisan agreement in the Parliament that business migration is beneficial. There has been some public statement-not by the Opposition, I hasten to say, and not by Senator Puplick-that the Government is planning to cut business migration. That is not the policy as outlined in this statement. There is an assessment that the likely outcome of some recent events, which I will not dwell on because they may be a bit diverting and provocative, is that the level of business migration might slow slightly. But that is not Government policy; there is no ceiling on business migration to make that happen other than the 54,000 person limit on economic migration overall. Business migration has been rising rapidly and we may have more than the 10,000 predicted. I also welcome the increased emphasis on monitoring of business migration to ensure that the mooted economic benefits do flow. </PARA>
<PARA> As a minor issue, but one that is to be welcomed, I note that in addition there is a recognition of concern by State and Territory governments-I do not think it will be an issue here in the Australian Capital Territory-over population distribution trends. I welcome and support the decision to give extra points to an applicant if the sponsor lives in an area consistent with State or Territory government settlement priorities. It will be principally the responsibility of the States to designate those areas. That is of proper concern to the Federal Government with the important issues of city and urban planning. </PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of skills, there is a broader strategy of skill development in Australia, within which the immigration matter has to be addressed. I support the priority given to the training and retraining of Australians. There is an obligation on all of us-on our education system and on Australian industry-to train more Australians. But it is necessary also to recognise that, even with the incentive, the pressure, the persuasion on Australian industry to train more Australians, about which the Government is currently involved in discussions, there will be gaps. Immigration can fill these gaps and, in so doing, create more jobs than the immigrants take. Employment remains a driving force in this Australian Labor Government's policy, and so it should be. Immigration has a substantial contribution to make in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> On a related issue, I want to express views essentially in support of those of Senator Puplick about the importance of prompt action on the question of assessment and recognition of overseas qualifications. I am happy that this has been referred to the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet, provided, as I expect, that the matter is dealt with promptly by it. It is important that this is seen within a broader context. That is the role of the structural adjustment committee. It is very important that this matter is not delayed. I look forward to the statement of Government policy on it and a positive Opposition response. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the question of administrative reforms to comment on two relatively minor ones consistent with the FitzGerald Committee approach and which are appropriate. One is the tightening of the focus of settlement strategies, more particularly in the area of new arrivals. There is also the emphasis on the settlement problems faced by women coming to this country and an emphasis on the multilingual skills of those recruited to the Department. In supporting that, I say briefly that one of the great problems in our country is that Australians tend to be far too monolingual. I include myself in that. A very sparse knowledge of the French language learned at high school does not contribute significantly to a broader understanding. It is good that in Australian primary education attention is now being paid to issues of language education. I regard that as a very important part of a future strategy for Australian education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support the changes to the review procedures outlined in this document. The departmental review unit should be able to provide in simple cases a prompt and efficient review to correct errors of fact or to accommodate rapid change in circumstances. But, of course, it is not enough; no-one pretends it is. Therefore, the enhanced immigration review panels, with their function of merit review and their capacity to make what are in most instances final decisions, are an appropriate format and are overdue. I support the fact that the ministerial review is reduced but retained in some important areas, and I also welcome the tabling requirements as part of the continuing process of opening up the debate in Australia on immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a part which I welcome and which I think in a sense can be seen as very typically Robert Ray, where he talks about guaranteeing the numbers. It is an excellent concept in itself, but it is very typical of this very efficient Minister. It has nothing to do with electoral matters but it is part of the statement on page 7 where he refers to the floating pass mark, which the Committee recommended to ensure that the best people are selected and that the numbers in the overall program are not exceeded. It seems to me that the floating pass mark concept has the capacity to work as a shock absorber so that, where the inflow of migrants is greater than expected in designated areas where we might wish it to be enhanced, such as in business migration or a particular skills area, within the points system it will accommodate the priority selection process for other applicants within that broader economic category. That is a proper process for the important matter of normal government administration, which is the allocation of necessarily limited resources amongst virtually unlimited demands. </PARA>
<PARA> On the political, humanitarian aspect of the report, I welcome the maintenance of a commitment to refugee intake. That has been a desirable feature of the immigration policies of all parties in Australia, and I support the continuation of the Determination of Refugee Status Committee with its process for reviewing individual refugee applications. I support the rejection of coercive measures to enforce citizenship. Citizenship is very important and it is appropriate that the FitzGerald Committee gave greater emphasis to it and that the Government has responded with the Year of Citizenship, with the focused attention, publicity and priority it has been given. But I do not think we ought to be starving people into it. I support the affirmation of non-discrimination but I have dealt with that sufficiently in my previous remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Bureau of Immigration Research, I, unlike Senator Puplick, welcome this proposal wholeheartedly. The FitzGerald Committee is absolutely correct, and the Minister in adopting the proposal has acted wisely. It is very important, firstly, that the information base on this issue is broadened. I know that was not a matter about which Senator Puplick was expressing reservations but I believe that one of the great problems-there are several-in this ill-informed debate is that governments of all persuasions have not been totally discharging their obligation to establish a proper factual base. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem is the lack of adequate communication of those facts which has enabled people to feed on rumour, innuendo and misunderstanding. Every senator has probably been to a public meeting where the most outrageous assertions have been made, as though they were facts, about the relative proportions of Asian and European migration, the proportion of Asians in Australia or, getting away from the racial issue, about the alleged benefits which are given to migrants on their arrival-that they all get cars, they all get jobs and they all get all sorts of wonderful assistance-which, of course, are not true. </PARA>

I see the question of its communications function as something similar to the proposed Canadian Race Relations Foundation which has an important job in spending the money on `race relations and cross cultural understanding, preserving heritage cultures and languages and strengthening community support and participation'. That was a quote of the Canadian Multiculturalism Minister, Garry Weiner, just prior to the last election. I am not sure whether he has been re-appointed, but the Government was re-elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to a point that I have been discussing over the last several months with regard to immigration, on which I wish to conclude; that is, the initiative of the Canadian Government, the Canadian House of Commons, which unanimously passed a Multiculturalism Bill on 18 July this year in the shadow of the election. Yet no politician in Canada succumbed to the temptation to take a cheap shot and exploit possible racial tensions for local domestic political benefit. The Canadian Parliament unanimously carried a resolution on the multiculturalism Bill. The Canadians amongst other things say that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . reinforces the direct responsibility of all departments and institutions of the Government to implement the new multiculturalism policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The resolution describes multiculturalism as a `fundamental characteristic of our evolving Canadian heritage and identity'. It unanimously stresses the importance of preserving and enhancing the multicultural heritage of Canadians and, inter alia, states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Government of Canada to:</PARA>

<PARA> (f) generally, carry on their activities in a manner that is sensitive and responsive to the multicultural reality of Canada. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the fact that the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia at its recent conference supported the concept of a charter of multiculturalism for Australia. I look forward to that step being taken in Australia either by way of a Bill, a charter or other statement. I welcome this ministerial statement as another major step forward. Together with the FitzGerald report it should enhance community debate on immigration, ethnic affairs and multiculturalism. I congratulate this Minister and his predecessors who have initiated and developed the report and the statement. I thank the members of the Committee for their contribution. I welcome the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan who preceded me in this immigration debate made a reference to the non-discrimination principle and took a cheap shot at Senator Puplick who led on this matter for the Opposition in that he insufficiently referred to the well-established non-discrimination principle in the Opposition parties. It is a bipartisan principle in this debate in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me remind Senator McMullan and those in the chamber that the Opposition parties in adopting the immigration and ethnic affairs policy some months ago reiterated a longstanding principle on immigration. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In selecting between one individual and another, immigration policy will not discriminate against applicants on the basis of their race, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, gender or religion. </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be clearer than that. Those are the very words that are used by the report of the FitzGerald Commission of Inquiry to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies that is before us in this debate. They are the same words that have occurred in the last six policies of the Liberal and National parties. The non-discrimination principle is supported by the Opposition. We are glad to see that the support given to the non-discrimination principle in the FitzGerald report is expressed in precisely the same terms as our long established policies in the Opposition. I also draw attention to the Opposition's clear statement:</PARA>
<PARA> All of the policies of the Liberal and National Parties are based upon respect for the value of each individual. We are totally committed to equal treatment and equal opportunity for all Australians regardless of race, colour, creed or country of origin within the framework of a just and tolerant society. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is heartening to see that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) in his speech here this morning reiterated that principle himself. It is right to say that he borrowed the concept of one Australia from the clearly expressed support for the concept that we want to put up front in immigration policy debate in this country; that is, that we are one nation, we are one Australia and we want to ensure that every Australian has an equal capacity to contribute to Australia without any barrier, without there being any second class citizen. That follows through to the non-discrimination principle in selecting potential Australians in an immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us the Government's response to a most important inquiry. About 15 months ago a thorough inquiry into Australia's immigration policies was set up. The execution of that inquiry cost some millions of dollars. The Chairman of that inquiry was Dr Stephen FitzGerald, an eminent Australian and a former Ambassador of this country to China. He is a person who has the confidence of all parties in this Senate chamber. In May this year members of the Committee brought their considered conclusions and recommendations to the Government. There were some 73 recommendations. They came as a great bombshell to the Labor Government. Members of the Committee said that they had weighed the immigration policy of the Government and found it wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public does not have confidence in immigration. When members of the public were asked about this in public opinion polls, the majority said that they wanted to see an end to immigration because they could not see a positive outcome in the national interest. Many of us would want to give the evidence to the Australian public, especially in the post-war migration phase of the 1950s and 1960s, and I would say right through the 1970s as well, to show the positive gains that have come to Australia, such as the development of this country; the enhancement of our population; new schools; the demand for housing and education-every manner of commodity that is required due to the increased population that has flowed from migration. We can turn to every area of Australian life and see how it has been enhanced by the waves of immigration that have occurred over the last 40 years. But because of the mishandling of immigration by the present Labor Government over the last five or six years the Australian public does not have confidence any more in immigration. So it was timely that the FitzGerald report was commissioned and that that report was placed in the Government's hands in the middle of May. </PARA>
<PARA> For seven months the Government has been working out how it will respond to this bombshell. This report which condemned the conduct of the immigration policies of the present Government still has to be responded to. It is a clear and well argued report. It is only today, seven months later, that the Minister, Senator Robert Ray, has given us in this ministerial statement the Government's response to that Committee inquiry. It is a most disappointing document. It misses the opportunity presented by this most important report. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia today the central, overriding issue in immigration policy is to renew public confidence in immigration. After five years of confusion and poor administration, the public does not have confidence in Australia's immigration program. This was the golden opportunity. The most important and far-reaching inquiry into immigration ever undertaken in this country was in the Government's hands. The present Minister, Senator Ray, came to his job with the support of all sides of this chamber. He had a reputation for understanding matters such as those involved in this portfolio. With a fresh and renewed start for looking at the Government's record, we thought that Senator Ray would be able to take this opportunity and give Australia a new direction-give back confidence to the Australian public. The Minister has not succeeded. He has failed to take up the opportunity that was given to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reflect for a moment on the immigration debate that occurred in August and September this year in this chamber and throughout Australia. At the end of those weeks I wrote an article for the Age newspaper in which I summarised where we had reached. The questions that were raised in that debate led to statements reaffirming important and sound principles in immigration on all sides. In the first week of the Senate's sitting the debate led Government members, Opposition members and the Australian Democrats to outbid each other in their commitment to the established non-discrimination principle, and to their total rejection of policies expressed in terms of racial targeting. All parties were underlining, and continue to underline, their absolute commitment to the equality of all Australians. All parties were emphasising the importance of accepting cultural diversity and the fact that each tradition brings an enriching contribution to one Australia. At the end of that debate all parties said that all along they have pursued the objectives of one Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of August the new Minister, Senator Ray, was appointed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He realised that the two-month debate had also underlined the fact that the Government was found wanting in its conduct of immigration policy. I wrote the following article in the Age newspaper very well known to you, Mr Deputy President:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the renewal of public confidence that matters most and this will require a new level of genuine leadership and credible explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister seems to have accepted this point and the person he has chosen to make the new start is Senator Robert Ray. This astute and influential Victorian was sworn in to the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs portfolio on 2 September. </PARA>
<PARA> The ball is at his feet. He has, quite genuinely, received good wishes from all sides in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> But if he fails to renew public confidence in immigration, that same Parliament will be unforgiving. For the sake of all Australians, his task is to turn away from the Hawke Government's five years of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Public confidence can only be regained by addressing the policy mistakes of the past five years. This can be achieved by openly correcting the administration of policies so that they are neither underhand nor biased, and by a factual, credible explanation of what immigration should be all about anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate's most useful starting point is the FitzGerald report into the Hawke Government's immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Today the moment of truth came. The ball was at the Minister's feet. He failed this chamber, and he failed Australia. There has been no positive response to this most important report. What we have as a result of the Minister's statement today is business as usual. The Labor Government, lobbied by its Caucus committee, lobbied by various factions within its lay Party around the country, has said, `Don't let us give in to the firm recommendations, the principal recommendations, of this major inquiry, the FitzGerald report. Let us accept the marginal matters in which there is some merit, but as to the mainstream of our immigration approach of the last five years we will go on undeterred'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very sad for the Minister, Senator Ray. He was rolled by the Prime Minister, rolled by Cabinet and rolled by the Caucus immigration committee. Now he stands in this chamber with the same mess about him as has been accumulated in all the years of the Labor Government. Does anyone here expect the public to have renewed confidence in immigration unless we have a change of government? I do not have that confidence. I believe that the only hope of getting the positive, central recommendations of the FitzGerald report implemented is to see the election of a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties are convinced that immigration policy should serve all Australians, that it should be in the national interest. That is why the central element of our policy is to attract to this country a majority of immigrants who have been chosen on the basis of the skills, the education, the competence and the contribution they will add to the Australian community. They will come here and create new jobs. They will not come here and take jobs away from Australians. There is a place for family reunion. If we have here a mother and two children-refugees who have been given a place in proper compassion by the Australian people-of course we want the husband of that family to be reunited with them. All things being equal, that husband should be able to come to Australia and be permanently resident here alongside his wife and children. We give proper weight to family reunion in our immigration policy. But the business as usual approach of the Labor Government is to keep family reunion as the major element of the immigration program it is endorsing here today. It has not heeded the recommendation of the FitzGerald report that the priority thrust in immigration selection be skill, education, youth, entrepreneurship and what will be a contribution to this country in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The press already has it right. The Advertiser this morning under the headline `Government to dump key migration proposals', states:</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the key recommendations of the controversial FitzGerald report on future immigration policy will be dumped by the Federal Government today in a move that will appease the country's ethnic communities. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Dr FitzGerald made scathing criticisms of the immigration program earlier this year and said it should be given a sharper economic focus. </PARA>
<PARA>Articles such as that, which appeared this morning in newspapers all around Australia, are right. The opportunity that was before this Government has been passed up and wasted. The only way that Australians will regain confidence in immigration in this country will be through the election of a Liberal-National Party government. In his statement today the Minister gave some specific figures on the shape of immigration over the next two or three years. Page 5 of his statement states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the migration program for the next two to three years is to be maintained at 140,000 places, comprising three main streams:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government retains the 140,000 places at a time when the business community and the Liberal and National parties are calling for increased migration based upon skill and not upon those who will come here and take away the jobs of Australians. Such expansion was passed up in the announcement. If the Labor Government is retained in office, we can expect the number to remain the same as that in recent years-that is, 140,000. The statement went on to outline the three main streams. This is the important point:</PARA>
<PARA>71,000 in a family category, 54,000 in an economic category and 14,000 in a humanitarian category, plus a special eligibility category of 1,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA>The arithmetic is correct; the figures add up to 140,000. Only 54,000 are in the economic category. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition will reverse that priority. The priority in our selection will be based on the national interest-skill and education and those who will create jobs for themselves and other Australians-rather than those who will come on an extended family or second-cousin basis but with the denial of those skills and contributions to Australia, or where there is grave doubt as to whether there would be such a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to remember that there are a million people around the world knocking on our doors every year seeking to immigrate to Australia. Australia is a land of settlement and has a pattern of immigration. However, we have the luxury of choosing from those one million the 140,000 or 170,000 whom we believe will be most at home in Australia and will make the greatest contribution to this country. Unashamedly, whilst reserving an appropriate number of places for family reunion and humanitarian-refugee-migration, we will give priority to the economic category, based upon those skills that we need and the potential that new Australians will offer by coming here. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the central thrust of the FitzGerald report has been rejected in the Minister's statement. Because of that and because of the Minister's failure to respond to the positive recommendations of the FitzGerald Committee-the Minister was rolled by the Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Caucus committee-he now stands as a continuing part of Labor's failure in immigration. I am sad for the Minister. The prospects that we had in his appointment last August have not been lived up to. Not even his perception and skill have been able to shift the Australian Labor Party from its five or six year pattern in office in failing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to citizenship. The findings of the FitzGerald report were flashed all around Australia in the first few days after its publication. A headline went around alerting Australians to the longstanding situation that one million permanent residents in Australia who are eligible to be citizens have not taken up citizenship. We in the Liberal and National parties who place the highest value upon citizenship as the ultimate expression of an individual's commitment to Australia were alarmed at the extent of that failure of so many living in Australia-one-sixteenth of us-not taking out that ultimate expression of commitment to Australia. So we have called for a program to encourage those one million residents to take out citizenship. The FitzGerald report made specific recommendations that would enhance that encouragement, but the Government has said `Not accepted. Not accepted. Not accepted'. That demonstrates another important failure in the Government's response today. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind this chamber and the Australian people that the only option left to regain a sound immigration policy and for the public to have confidence in Australia's immigration policies is the election of a Liberal and National Party government. We must remember the important contributions that were made in the Menzies period, in the post-war period, by a Liberal and National Party government and the confidence that was expressed then in immigration by the Australian people. We must remember the Fraser Government's record, the delicate, careful and secure way it handled the Indo-China refugee crisis in those years and the way in which settlement was successful during the Fraser years. Those two great Menzies and Fraser periods of Australian public confidence in immigration stand in enormous contrast to the last five and six years of failure under the Labor Government. Today's announcement makes it clear that that lamentable record will continue. The only remedy will be the election of a Liberal and National Party government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Government's response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, the so-called FitzGerald report, and in particular the statement by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) in that regard. We are also taking note of, and as necessary debating, the Minister's statement on criminal deportations, which he incorporated in Hansard this morning. I note at the outset-I do so with regret-the absence of the Minister from the chamber. I suppose two interpretations could be placed upon that absence. The first is that it is a rather overt rudeness to Opposition speakers on this matter. I do not wish to accuse the Minister of that. I have not thought Senator Ray-I would not say this about some of his colleagues-guilty of that particular behaviour characteristic. Secondly, I can only assume that, unless the Minister is urgently engaged in some matter of vitally important government business-I suppose that is always possible-his absence from the chamber has some relationship to his wish not to be too closely associated with the statement that he had to bring down this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Minister for his courtesy in providing me this morning with advance copies of the statements and also a number of press releases on associated topics. I must confess that I have not had time to read all of them in full as there were a great many. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to support fully, on behalf of National Party senators in particular, the response to the Minister's statement which has been given this afternoon by Senator Puplick. I propose to be relatively brief, as others wish to speak and as we have the pressure of the legislative timetable. But let me take up a few points of detail. I begin, like Senator Puplick, by welcoming the Minister's statement on criminal deportation. Our courts, particularly some of our lesser courts, sometimes take a great deal upon themselves when they overturn decisions of the Minister in this area. The guidance that the Minister and the Government through him seek to give to the courts by the statement that was delivered this morning on this matter is, therefore, entirely appropriate and, for my part, fully acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the immigration policy more generally, while there are many aspects of the Minister's statement with which I agree, there are also major aspects which I think have to be described as disappointing. In saying that I do not so much seek to criticise the Minister himself. On the contrary, he may well turn out to be an exceedingly good-that is to say, commonsense-Minister for immigration if he is given a chance to do so by his colleagues in the Cabinet. But I criticise those Cabinet colleagues, and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who have caused the Minister to amend in many material and important particulars the statement which he would otherwise have chosen to bring down this morning, so as to make that statement more acceptable to the left-wing of the Australian Labor Party-what one might call in this case the Theophanous wing. Just as we have been referring in the last three days or so to the Hand wing of the Labor Party and the maladministration of Aboriginal Affairs policy, so today it is appropriate to refer to what will be called, for some time to come perhaps, the malformation of immigration policy by the Theophanous wing, the same left wing of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate result of this is that we have in this document something of a mishmash, the precise outcome of which is very difficult to foresee but which, on the face of it-as other speakers on my side of the chamber have already indicated-seems unlikely to differ markedly in terms of outcome from the present policy. That, of course, is the policy which has led, and is still leading, to the strong upsurge of unease, disquiet and opposition which is being voiced increasingly strongly. I can only say that I cannot see this revised policy changing that in any significant degree, if indeed at all. That, I think, is a matter for considerable regret. I hope that I may be proved wrong in that regard because it is clear that the outcomes which are being delivered by the present policy need to be changed in the face of that growing unease, disquiet and opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of the outcome of the present policy that the FitzGerald Committee was so trenchant in its criticism. I should say that it was less trenchant in its final forms of criticism than when the report was originally drafted and before it was revised at the request of the Prime Minister, just as Senator Ray's original statement has been revised at the same request. In that sense, history is repeating itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is an issue which, as the Minister has truly said in his statement, `touches the lives of every Australian whether born here or not'. I say amen to that. As the Minister has also said, the central message of the FitzGerald report, namely, that immigration should be for all Australians, has received wide support-and so it should. That is the very theme of the Opposition's one Australia approach to the whole question that we have been expounding over recent months. I also agree with the Minister when he says that we seek `to ensure that those born in Australia and those who migrate to Australia are equally accorded their rights'; that is, the same rights as citizens or potential citizens, once having been granted permanent residence, of one Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not wish this afternoon to strike an unduly partisan note on this matter, I say to the Minister that nothing has been more shameful over recent months than the actions of Ministers, from the Prime Minister down, in seeking to suggest, imply, or even overtly assert, that the Opposition's view of these matters would in some way adversely affect the rights and freedoms of our fellow Australians already resident in this country, most notably in our various ethnic communities. As Senator Puplick has said it is the Labor Party that has politicised this issue-not the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is in error when he seeks to suggest-I think it is fair to add that he does not anywhere expressly say it-that the Government's multicultural spending programs are `quite separate from immigration policy as such'. While I have no intention-time not permitting-to debate the matter further this afternoon, the truth is that, as the FitzGerald Committee clearly found, those very multicultural expenditure programs have done as much as anything to raise antagonisms within the Australian community to immigration as a whole. Because of that they are putting in jeopardy the very maintenance of that policy on immigration to which I and every other senator on this side of the chamber-indeed, I would say, in the chamber as a whole-subscribe and which is fundamental to Australia's long term future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick dealt cogently with that portion of the Minister's remarks which sought to blame the Opposition for what Senator Ray alleged to be feelings of disquiet in Asia arising out of the earlier public debate on these matters. I regard those remarks by the Minister as totally hypocritical when our Prime Minister, and particularly our pathetic Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), have been projecting themselves around Asia in a manner which could hardly be more calculated to distort the debate and to poison the wells of understanding on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me note also the Minister's tongue-in-cheek remarks about bipartisanship in this area of policy. I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA>In that context I now state that this Government believes that a return to a bipartisan policy is in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to go on the record and say to the Opposition that should you accept the invitation I now extend to you to return to a bipartisan, non-discriminatory policy, the Government, for its part, will applaud and in no way seek to take political advantage of the fact that you have done so. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I regard those phrases by the Minister as utterly tongue-in-cheek. As I said by way of interpolation in quoting the Minister, I think it is important to obtain, if reasonably possible, a degree of bipartisanship in this area. It is a great and vital matter of national public importance that we are discussing this afternoon. But it takes two to tango. The Opposition has no intention at all of dancing to the tunes which successive Labor Party Ministers for immigration have been playing in this area over the past 5 1/2 years and against which an overwhelming majority of Australians is so vigorously reacting. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister of what I said some months ago on this aspect when I spoke in this place on the Government's urgency motion on immigration. I said then, and I repeat, that we shall have bipartisanship again in this area of policy. Let there be no doubt or disquiet about that. We shall have it when the Government, gradually no doubt, moves to pick up our policies in this, as in so many other areas. I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we shall welcome that return to bipartisanship by the Government when it makes, gradually, the move to attain it. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention briefly only one other point. I refer to the Bureau of Immigration Research which the Government proposes to establish at an initial cost of some $4m a year and which will employ over 40 people. Yet, so far as one can see, this Bureau will not principally be a Bureau of Immigration Research, which its name would imply, so much as a bureau which will, as is said, commission research by others. Will it be research that is commissioned or will it be propaganda? Will it be public relations documents that are commissioned by this body? Will we see in this body another body akin to the National Media Liaison Service-the `animals'; the NMLS? Is that the body which is going to be set up by this Government with a view, as the Government would say, to promoting a better understanding of these matters within the Australian community-a better understanding or, what is sometimes known as brainwashing or social engineering?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to the Minister, through you, that the Opposition will be paying very great attention to the establishment of this body. We will be examining very closely, including through the relevant Estimates committee of this Senate, its activities and how in fact it spends the significant funds which the Government apparently proposes to accord it. Throughout all this our emphasis is, and will continue to be, on the one Australia to which the Minister says he too adheres-although, I think it is fair to say, he does not use that term. It is all the more a pity that, as the shadow Minister for immigration, Mr Cadman, MHR, said at a press conference earlier today:</PARA>
<PARA>in-fighting within the Government has produced a policy which is almost identical with the existing policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Teague said at the conclusion of his remarks, it does appear that the only way in practice in which we are going to change that situation is by changing this failed Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I will try to keep my remarks brief because of the lengthy business list of the Senate. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) for the statement he made on behalf of the Government in its response to the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policy. The statement is detailed and covers a wide range of areas. It indicates-and I suggest that people read it and the FitzGerald report carefully-that there is an overwhelming acceptance by the Government of the recommendations of the FitzGerald Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I found it interesting to hear Senator Puplick and Senator Teague in particular comment earlier in the debate that the FitzGerald Committee recommendations have been overwhelmingly rejected by the Government. Unfortunately, some headlines appeared in the press today, before the report was released, that FitzGerald has been overwhelmingly rejected. I just want to quote to the Senate from a press release issued today by Dr FitzGerald which is headed `Dr FitzGerald Welcomes Cabinet Decision'. Amongst other things, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Cabinet has adopted a set of policies which is both profoundly reformist and yet also reflects a harmony of compassionate, social and economic objectives. In a climate of emotional debate and against intense pressure to favour one special interest or another, this is an impressive achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement issued by Dr Stephen FitzGerald on 8 December 1988 completely refutes remarks made earlier in the debate by Opposition spokespeople that the Government has rejected the FitzGerald recommendations in a major way. I will return later to Dr FitzGerald's comments on specific matters about which Opposition members have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Australian people generally, and particularly those interested in the specifics of Australia's immigration policy, could do nothing but deplore the attitude of the Federal Opposition in this debate over the last six or seven months since the FitzGerald recommendations were released. We had the extraordinary performance here today of Senator Stone speaking supposedly on behalf of the Opposition, yet he is no longer on the front bench of the Opposition because his remarks could not be tolerated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He is still Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and speaks with that authority. But he is not a member of the front bench of the Opposition because his attitudes about immigration turned out to be contrary to what a number of other members of the Opposition stated. It is confusing because I cannot really see that there is much difference between what Senator Stone said and what John Howard said on a number of occasions in press interviews. </PARA>
<PARA> At least John Stone should be given the credit for belling the cat honestly about what the Opposition is really about on immigration. In a public interview earlier this year he said, `Let us not beat about the bush. The Opposition's statements and policies are about reducing Asian immigration'-full stop. When he said that there was a conflagration in the Opposition parties. Senator Baden Teague, who spoke earlier, went public condemning those remarks. A number of other Liberal senators went public condemning those remarks. In the end, even though John Howard was saying between the lines the same things, he was forced to sack Senator Stone. He could not sack him as Leader of the National Party in the Senate; he could only sack him from the front bench. We saw a rather bizarre reshuffling of the seating arrangements on the Opposition side. Senator Stone, who was sitting next to Senator Austin Lewis, went over to the second XI or, I suppose, to the sin bin at the back of the Senate. He is now sitting in a position near the Australian Democrats, who, I must say, I do not find most of Senator Stone's policies and views comfortable with anything that they stand for. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that in this whole debate on matters of considerable obvious public sensitivity about immigration, the Opposition's performance over several months has been disgraceful. It has done the Opposition no good and it has affected Australia's relations overseas. It was once said that the famous first shot at Concord in the American War of Independence was heard around the world. I say that Senator Stone's remarks about reducing Asian immigration were certainly heard all through Asia and that they had a dreadful impact on our relations with Asian countries. No other remarks by an Australian politician have done Australia's reputation overseas so much damage than the remarks made by Senator Stone and Mr Howard. They deserve to be condemned for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement contains a number of highlights which I think everybody in Australia will welcome. First of all, the Minister referred to the establishment of a Bureau of Immigration Research. Senator Stone says that this is going to be the equivalent of a propaganda exercise like the National Media Liaison Service. Nothing could be further from the truth. He talks about conducting research. He asks, `What sort of research?' Obviously, in Australia's immigration and population policies consistent research will have to be conducted and commissioned by the Bureau from experts-I would suspect not only from this country but also from overseas. Not since the seminal report of the Borrie National Population Inquiry in the early 1970s have we had an opportunity in Australia to make decisions about what sort of population this country should have in the twenty-first century. There has been a range of projections from 20 million to 35 million over the next 40 or 50 years. These are fundamental issues which this country is going to have to face up to during the 1990s. The decisions we make on immigration will affect the population numbers in this country next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Bureau of Immigration Research will deal specifically with ongoing research into the population numbers that this country should have and the impact that various population numbers will have on the economy and social structure of this country. That is what the Bureau of Immigration Research will have to deal with. I will be the first to join Senator Stone in condemning it if it does nothing else but send out a few press releases. But certainly it has to have the resources to publicise its research and findings as part of an informed public debate. I know that members of the Opposition do not want an informed public debate on immigration because they are appealing to base prejudice in much of the immigration policy they are putting forward to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to mention about Senator Ray's statement is something that has not been noted widely but I think it is something that Australians-Liberal, Labor, Australian Democrats or National Party-can be very proud of. In the last 40 years Australia has taken over 470,000 refugees into Australia. Since 1975 it has taken 175,000. Four hundred and seventy thousand people in 40 years is almost the population of Tasmania. It is a commendable achievement that Australia has met its obligations in the international arena in taking such a large number of refugees. Few other countries have had the courage to do so and in particular in the last 12 years in relation to Indo-Chinese refugees. It was not the Australian Labor Party's policy to intervene in the Vietnam War and prolong it and the misery that went with it. But as a consequence of that war large numbers of people were displaced and Australia accepted its responsibility, firstly under the Fraser Government and then under the Hawke Government, to accept refugees from Indo-China. If we had not done that it would have been one of the more immoral acts in our history. Despite the fact that some people in our community, aided and abetted by the Senator Stones of the world, are trying to campaign on a racial basis against immigrants from Indo-China, we ought to be very proud of the fact that we are one of the few countries that takes refugees on a humanitarian basis in such large numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point in Senator Ray's remarks is the new system of appeals. I have been in the Senate only some 16 or 17 months. As a senator I do not get the same constituency work that most members of the House of Representatives get with a specific electorate. But I have to say that the largest amount of constituency work I get, probably like most other senators, is from people wanting to appeal to change decisions not to allow people, relatives and so on, to immigrate to Australia. They know that despite the Department rejecting people's applications to immigrate because they do not have the required number of points, and despite the fact that they may appeal to the appropriate tribunals in each of the States and be rejected further, they can still come to a politician to try to get the decision overturned by ministerial discretion. I suppose there is not a member of this Parliament who has been here for a couple of years who has not, on a number of occasions, gone directly to the Minister, whether Labor or Liberal, to get special consideration for someone to be admitted to the country despite being previously rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray and the Government have proposed that that discretion by the Minister be removed. I think that is an excellent step because for every one who gets in under ministerial discretion, I suspect several thousand others do not get in who should be let in under the same criteria. Therefore, injustices are continually perpetrated against many thousands of people because a few are able to get the Minister to change the decision of the appeals tribunal or of the Department. The Minister will still hold some discretion but when the Minister uses it the information will be tabled in the Parliament so that people will be able to see that the Minister is being consistent and the special reasons why he has used his discretion. I also note in the statement that a much more rigorous set of guidelines will be laid down for the appeal procedures within the Department. That is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard comments today by Senator Teague and Senator Puplick regarding the numbers and the various categories under the immigration program. We have heard that this is where the recommendations of the FitzGerald Inquiry have been totally rejected by the Government. Outlandish remarks have been made that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Ray have been rolled by the so-called Left and so on. I will quote to the Senate another aspect of what Dr Stephen FitzGerald said today publicly in a press release, which I have referred to already. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Referring to Cabinet's decisions on family migration and skill migration, Dr FitzGerald said that what mattered was not how one described the categories but the outcomes, and the mechanisms for producing them. ``Apart from Immediate Family, where the numbers decided by Cabinet are very close to those recommended by the Committee,'' he said, ``Cabinet has accepted the recommendation which is fundamental to selecting the young, the skilled and the entrepreneurial-the best immigrants-which is the recommendation for adoption of a principle of highest scores only or first past the post (the ``floating pass mark'')''. </PARA>
<PARA> ``With the decision to give most points to employability factors, for both ``economic'' applicants and Extended Family applicants, the actual outcomes will be as the Committee recommended,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that further Opposition speakers in the debate will take note of what Doctor Stephen FitzGerald has said and will no longer try to put to the Senate this stereotyped view, this lie in fact, that the FitzGerald Committee of Inquiry has had its major recommendations rejected by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A further point I wish to make regarding one of the recommendations and comments in both the ministerial report and in the FitzGerald report is on the question of Australian citizenship. The Government rejected the FitzGerald Committee recommendation that if people do not take out Australian citizenship there should be some financial penalties regarding eligibility for pensions and so on. The Government has rejected that. I do not think anybody, even those in Opposition, would cavil at that decision. If they want to have a coercive immigration policy, if they want to go around to ethnic communities saying to people, `We are going to coerce you to be an Australian citizen', I would love to see them try. That would be an attitude more equivalent to an eastern European country than to a democracy such as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the questions dealt with by the FitzGerald Committee concerning the million people in Australia who are eligible for citizenship but who have not taken it out is the question concerning the oath of allegiance. I note that the FitzGerald Committee recommends a new form of declaration of citizenship which it says would be more meaningful. It says that the possible citizenship declaration could be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I undertake to respect the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> I will endeavour to inform myself about the principles upon which these laws, and related institutions, are based. </PARA>
<PARA> I undertake to accept and respect the institutions and principles of Australian society, including parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality of women, universal education. </PARA>
<PARA> I undertake to accept and respect the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin which informs the laws and institutions of Australian society and the immigration policy of Australia and under which I have taken up residence in Australia and thereby become entitled to Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a matter for further discussion. Certainly, the Government's response in the document is to accept it as a concept and as one for further development. Why I have raised this matter and why I am interested in raising it is because I believe one of the reasons we do not have more immigrants to Australia taking out citizenship is that many find it unnecessary that they should swear an oath of allegiance or an affirmation of allegiance which at present asks them to swear that they will bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen of Australia. Many immigrants come from countries with republican constitutions and cannot understand why they should swear allegiance to a Queen of Australia who basically resides 12,000 miles or 25,000 kilometres from Australia. The FitzGerald recommendations are an excellent way of overcoming some of the apprehensions migrants have when taking out Australian citizenship. In this debate I do not want to express my own views as a support for Australia becoming a republic in the near future. But I do believe that the recommendations made by the FitzGerald Committee on a new form of citizenship declaration is the way we should be proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area I wish to comment on relating specifically to the report is the question of multiculturalism. The Minister in his statement said that the FitzGerald report was not dealing specifically with the issue of multiculturalism but that it has become part of the debate. Unfortunately, part of that debate has been fanned by some of the unfortunate remarks of Opposition speakers such as Senator Stone. I would like to put on the record the excellent statement of what multiculturalism stands for as stated in the Minister's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are already, in a descriptive sense, a multicultural nation. Multiculturalism is premised on an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia. It embraces basic issues of individual expression, social justice and economic efficiency. We need multicultural policies precisely in order to ensure that insecurity, disharmony, injustice and inefficiency do not disfigure our society. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that succinct description of multiculturalism is one that should be publicised widely within Australia. It will go a long way to overcoming some of the prejudiced views put forward by the Opposition. Australia is one of the very few countries in the history of the world that have been able to organise and run a successfully planned immigration policy for over 40 years. Several million people have come to this country under the planning that began in the 1940s. It has made Australia a much better country, a stronger country and a more diverse country. But above all, for people such as me, a fourth generation Australian, it has enabled Australians to start to develop and evolve an identity that is uniquely Australian. I do not consider myself a European; I consider myself an Australian. Australia is part of the Pacific Basin. We have that role to play in the world. We are not specifically part of Asia; we are part of the south-west Pacific. Our future lies in relations with Asian countries. I believe that the immigration program that has been so successful in this country and has had bipartisan support up until three months ago has been a great bipartisan support up until three months ago has been a great credit to this country. Although we have had people from over 140 countries come to this country over the last 200 years-and particularly the last 40 years-I think this country has been very successful in enabling those people to become Australians and to participate in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the analogy I would like to conclude with relates to how people have been successful in the past. People have often said that sporting achievements in Australia are a sign of success. In the last 40 years in sport we have seen southern Europeans, with names such as Barassi and so on, participating in the great Australian sport, Australian rules football. In the next 10 or 15 years I look forward to seeing a Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground starting on Boxing Day against the West Indies with the Australian batting side being opened by Nguyen van Thien, the son of a Vietnamese refugee who has come to this country, being applauded when he hits the runs to make his maiden century. I know that all Australians will applaud him as an Australian from a different background. Many of the rest of us will be applauding him as an Australian. That is part of the ongoing multicultural aspect of Australia's immigration program. It is one in which we should all be proud because it has been extremely successful. I used that analogy not as the only one because there are many others. In the years to come people from all different nationalities will play a part in ensuring that in the next century Australia stands for something distinctive, important and successful in the world. I commend the Minister for his statement to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>Speaker for the motion:</PARA>
<PARA>Sen. John Panizza:</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you Mr. Chairman, I was hoping to speak on a previous motion but this is a very similar motion so I'll speak on this one. What I would like to point out Mr. Chairman, that migration to Australia has got strongly out of balance. It seems to me and I am sure that it is, we are getting too many from one part of the world and the reason we are doing that is because this Government is being too lazy to try and attract migration from our traditional sources that we used to get them before. I am not going to say that there is too many Asians in Australia, I'm saying that we are not getting any from Europe and Southern Europe and places like that that helped build Australia up before. Mr. Chairman, Australia has got to know where it is going. I know you may call it social engineering but we want to know what sort of Australia we are going to have in ten years time and if we want to do that well we have got to look at our sources of migration right now. And another thing what Australia does need is a balanced migration to get people in that fit into the workforce that we have already or already have not got. For an example, especially the ones out here in outer areas, we've got unemployment in the cities, in fact Australia's unemployment is about 7.2% and yet there is a lot of places in the Goldfields and the Agricultural areas that cannot be filled and the traditional migrants from Europe used to fill those jobs in years gone by. I'll just give you a few figures Mr. Chairman out of the Fitzgerald Report into Migration and it makes your hair stand on end. As I said it is an enditement of this Government that we've got 7.2% unemployment, but when you look at the breakdown figures you've got overseas born in the unemployment, ranks at 8.4%, but when you break that down further, those from the United Kingdom and Ireland are 6.8%, the Italians are 3.2%, the Greek 5.6% and yet those from Vietnam is 30.5% which was at this time last year and now has risen to 42% and you've got those from Lebanon at 28.3%. In other words we are getting too many migrants that are not employable or choose to go on the unemployment list. And my final point, Mr Chairman, is that the commitment by all migrants should be that we have one Australia. We can tolerate multi-culturalism but that is something we can tolerate. We encourage it but above all there must be one Australia Mr. Chairman and that's the number one undertaking that migrants have got to do before they are admitted to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you. </PARA>
<PARA> West Australian Liberal Senator, John Panizza, claims the majority of Asian migrants living in Australia are unemployable. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza told the Liberal State conference in Esperance that the FitzGerald report pointed to the need for a more balanced immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> He said eight point four percent of the nation's unemployed were migrants, and of that amount, more than 30 percent were Vietnamese. </PARA>
<PARA> State conference supported a resolution to limit the intake of refugees and other migrants in the humanitarian category to a maximum of 20 percent of Australia's total migrant intake. </PARA>
<PARA> Another more controversial resolution-to restrict Australia's migrant intake to people of European origin-was deferred. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will wait until Senator McMullan reads today's Hansard to see whether he wants to call me a liar. Aside from all of that, this twisted press release has branded me as a migrant basher. I was vilified in Asia and in the Australian press. Let me tell honourable senators that, as one belonging to a migrant family, I have seen more discrimination than anyone else in this place. I have experienced as much discriminationb as any discriminated or disadvantaged group in Australia. I have seen discrimination in schools, in employment and in social life. Let no-one in this place call me a migrant basher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall now comment on the report. Before it is suggested that our migration policy is discriminatory-of course, members of this Government claim theirs is not-let me stress that remarks made by my colleagues have been beaten up by the media and carried on by others such as Dr Theophanous, who was in Melbourne when I addressed a migrant group. He was also invited and he kicked up a fuss because the Italian community there had the audacity to invite a Liberal. He thinks that the Labor Party has a monopoly on interest in migrant groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to make a couple of points on naturalisation, labour skills, and business migration as they relate to the Government's response. The report correctly identified citizenship as the ultimate commitment to Australia. I am disappointed and dismayed that the Government has failed to take up this point. I do not believe that non-citizens should be denied any basic benefits and social security, especially if they have worked in Australia, or the right to work or to enjoy normal life. Of course, this was not the case with pre-1950 migration. I believe that one should hold Australian citizenship before one has the right to nominate to sponsor other migrants, other than one's spouse and dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to skills. I believe that the Government is not doing enough to attract migrants whose skills are presently in demand in Australia. The categories I know which come to mind are building construction employees, medical and paramedical personnel for remote areas, and mining personnel. At present there are vacancies in Australia for at least 4,000 bricklayers. Bricklayers are not ever defined as tradesmen by the migration authorities. The dream of owning one's own home or even living in a decent rented home will remain a dream, despite the present building boom. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan pointed out that the Australian Council of Trade Unions had something to say about skilled migrants. It believes the emphasis should be on teaching Australians who are here at present rather than bringing in people who already have skills. That may be so, but by the time Australians are trained the boom will be over. The boom is on now and there is a demand for bricklayers and other workers now rather than in five or six years time, when people will be trained in these skills. Australia is probably one of the best equipped countries in the world for education, whether professional, semi-professional, or skilled and semi-skilled trades. There are no better opportunities in any other country in the world. If Australians are not taking up the opportunities to become skilled, I believe we should admit people who are willing to come here and work in projects in remote areas where they are most needed. I am afraid that Australia has bred many people who would rather be handed a snake than a shovel. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a shortage of nurses not only in remote areas but Australia wide, and there is a shortage of doctors, but mainly in remote areas. There are South African doctors willing to come to Australia and work in those remote areas but they are not admitted. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will take their applications but that is as far as it goes. The applications simply pile up and the remote areas do not get these doctors, who are well qualified to work and are willing to come to Australia but are not admitted. Their only crime is that they are white, come from South Africa and have been educated at the University of Cape Town-where incidentally Dr Christian Barnard, who was the first person in the world to perform a heart transplant, was educated. The remote areas remain devoid of doctors while this Government carries on its prejudice against certain people wanting to migrate to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I said I would be brief. I turn now to the skilled mining personnel. Not enough of these people can be found in Australia and, once again, the skills criteria and trade union prejudice will prevent them from coming here. Worse still, as the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, would know, not only do we not have enough skilled personnel but also countries such as Canada and probably South America are taking the ones we do have. So the need to bring in others to replace those who have gone to other parts of the world is becoming greater every day. The Minister mentioned a tripartite agreement with the unions. I fear for the future because, as Senator McMullan pointed out, that is how the Government will attempt to fix the skills problem. We may teach many Australians the necessary skills but, as I have already said, we will not get them out into the remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to business migration, I totally agree with the view in the report that we need to encourage business migration because of the benefits that flow to Australia. I would like to see a monitoring system put into action to ensure that those business migrants are dinkum. Temporary status could be given to such people for two years or so to allow them to prove that a business can be established and to check that the money is not remitted overseas to bring in another family. In this case I know what I am talking about because I have spoken to a bank manager in Perth. This is going on. People come in with half a million dollars. They get a passport; they return to their country of origin to carry on a business, the half million dollars is given to another family to come in, that half million dollars goes out again and so it goes on. The same half million dollars gets circulated time and time again. There are some genuine immigrants who set up businesses and family homes and who intend to remain here, but there are many who do not. It is time the Government took that into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not taken up enough of the recommendations of the FitzGerald report, despite Senator Schacht's claim. It has not taken them up because of pressures from certain minority migrant groups. It is a case of the tail wagging the dog. We should be master of our own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate what migrants have done for Australia and what Australia has done for migrants. Many migrants, especially people who arrived before 1950, have been discriminated against. They did not make too many noises about that, although I know there were riots in Kalgoorlie in 1934 and in other places. In the final analysis the migrants provide their worth to Australia and they made their contribution. And as I belong to a migrant family, I can record my appreciation of what Australia has done for migrants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Government's response to the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which was submitted to the Government some time in May. It was tabled in the House of Representatives on 3 June. It was open to pubic debate for a stated period of three months. It was subjected to workshops, public meetings and consultations between various and varied committees and groups and between lobbyists and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). It was tabled in the Senate in August and now, on 8 December, the Government has given its formal response. The Australian Democrats believe that it was proper and correct for the Government to deliberate at length on its response because it is a very important report and it is a very important issue. It is obvious from the tenor of the Government's response that it has looked at the report and has listened to the representations from various concerned community groups and individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The FitzGerald report did not address the issues that the Government expected it to address. The Government expected that the FitzGerald Committee would change the points system so that the blow-outs which had been occurring over the last few years in immigration numbers would cease. Everyone who had the 70 points was eligible to migrate to Australia, and this was causing a blow-out in the projected numbers. In fact, the report did not address this matter specifically. This, no doubt, is why the Government raised the number of points necessary for a person to enter Australia from 70 to either 75 or 80. It did this without warning last June. This change was not debated in the Parliament; it was not required to be debated. It was made quietly and it has caused much concern to many people. It has been criticised because people who had already applied for migration and who believed they would attain the 70 points found, without warning, that they could not. I commend the Minister for stating in his speech that any changes from now on will be demonstrably open, consistent and equitable; that no more decisions will be made behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA> When tabling the Government's response the Minister said that immigration was an issue which touched the lives of every Australian, whether born here or not. That is absolutely true. The Refugee and Migrant Services group from the Australian Council of Churches, in response to the FitzGerald report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the lasting impression of the Report is that it has added fuel to those elements in Australian society which have opposed immigration, particularly of non-English-speaking background immigrants, and have predicted dire consequences for multicultural policy. If all of the recommendations in the FitzGerald report were to be accepted then we would have produced a meaner spirited, less fair and divisive nation. The costs in terms of community relations would be unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an indictment of the basic tenor of the report. The Australian Democrats believe that that criticism is justified. On the whole, the Democrats are pleased about the way in which the Government has dealt with some of the controversial aspects of the report. I will talk initially on multiculturalism. Dr Stephen FitzGerald showed confusion and misapprehension of the whole concept of multiculturalism despite submissions which were made to the Committee. It was his confusion which led to the unfortunate public statements which were made on immigrants from Asia by parliamentary members of the Opposition. Then, of course, the debate was taken up in the community. We heard a debate which I never thought we would hear in this country in this day and age. I did not believe that we would ever be debating the possibility of discriminating against people on the basis of their racial origin. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say at the annual conference of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia that the Government is totally committed to multiculturalism. That has been emphasised again in the Minister's response to the report. I was also pleased to note that the recommendation in the FitzGerald report that the number of refugees from Indo-China should be scaled down was also quite correctly dismissed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats were also pleased to see that the FitzGerald recommendation in relation to discrimination against people who had not thought or chosen to take up citizenship has been rejected. I think the Government is taking the right path in encouraging people to take up citizenship and in proclaiming the advantages of citizenship commitment to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main the Government's response to the report is responsible and the Democrats are in broad agreement with many of the Government's responses to the recommendations. We are in disagreement with some. Because of the lack of time and opportunity to analyse all of the responses in detail-we are not sure of the full implications of some of them-we may have to respond to some at a later time. The Government has not complied with some of the recommendations which are based on a very dry economic rationalism which would treat prospective migrants as mere economic units. In a paper delivered to the FECCA Conference last week, Walter Lippman said that the FitzGerald recommendations `clearly denigrated important social factors including motivation for immigration'. He went on to quote Peter Robinson in the Sydney Morning Herald, who he said put it bluntly. Peter Robinson said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we regard immigrants as economic objects to be exploited for their money we will get economic objects who will exploit us. If we see the newcomers as valuable additions to the human wealth and cultural depth of our society, that is the kind of invaluable immigrants we may have some chance of attracting. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has also acknowledged that in the past there have been many irrational areas in immigration, that many decisions have been made behind closed doors without regard to the Parliament. Now they will be open; they will either have to be legislated for, or they depend on regulations which can be openly tabled; or the Minister will at least have to table his reasons for making decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has rejected one of the basic recommendations of the FitzGerald Committee, which was to divide immigrants into three categories-A, B and C. FitzGerald recommended that category A, family immigration, should remain self-determining but was likely to increase to about 40,000; that category B, refugee/humanitarian, should increase to 15,000 people; and that category C, the open category, should form the balance of around 95,000 migrants. The Government's recommendation is that those categories should be changed to a family migration intake, which would consist of immediate family of some 41,000. This would be demand driven; that is, it would be hard to put a ceiling on these numbers because the demand would come from the families in Australia. It recommends a further extended family category of some 30,000, which would be residual, to take up the remainder of the 71,000 to be allowed in under that category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's second recommendation concerns the economic migration area. Senator Panizza has already talked about the business migration program, as I have done at length in the past. I am very pleased to see that the Government will take up the FitzGerald recommendation that there should be auditing and monitoring of what happens to the money that is brought in by business migrants. Some come in as genuine business migrants, invest correctly and set up businesses, but there is no doubt-and this has been raised publicly before-that a number do not. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspects of economic migration, with a total of 54,000 potential migrants, depend partially on the points test. The Government has recommended changes in the points test. It is advocating a floating total of points which can be changed as the numbers of migrants ebb and flow. This could be very difficult to administer. It needs to be looked at in further detail before pronouncements can be made. Further details need to be known about exactly how it is to work. Where there is a floating total of points we will have a queue of migrants, some of whom are not going to be sure whether or not they will get here. Even though, as the Minister has explained, they can re-enter the queue twice, this may not be a satisfactory solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is recommending in the area of humanitarian migration that 12,500 refugees should be admitted with a contingency reserve of 1,500. A number of people, groups and community organisations that have looked at the issue of refugee migration have suggested that the number should be increased. The Democrats would certainly go along with this suggestion. Australia can afford to increase the number of refugees to the suggested target put forward by the Australian Council of Churches of 20,000. We cannot foresee what tragedies or events will take place in the world, but provision should be made within our migration scheme to play our part in taking in refugees. Other countries do it; Australia can do it too. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which was looked at by the FitzGerald Committee and by the Government is the area of review. The Government has suggested a two-tier review, which certainly would be fairer than the present system. On the Government's projected two-tier review system, first reviews would be undertaken by an independent section within the Department. That would mean that if people's applications had been rejected by simple error this would be picked up immediately. If they then chose to appeal against this, they would go before the immigration review panels. The immigration review panels as they stand are not satisfactory. I spoke up against this in the debate on the Migration Amendment Bill 1987 when a fee of $240 was brought in. We found that migrants were paying a fee for a review system which was not a true review system at all. The Minister has suggested that the immigration review panels should be overhauled and that the credentials, qualifications and suitability of the members who sit on them should be looked at closely. The Democrats look forward to learning more about how the Government proposes to proceed in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as overseas qualifications are concerned, this area has been problematical all the way along the line. There have been improvements, but there is a lot of room for further improvement in this area. Very often prospective migrants are not given correct information. They are assured that their trade and professional qualifications will be recognised and that they will find work here. They come to Australia and find that this is not the case. Others find that the process required to have their qualifications recognised is very lengthy, very protracted, very difficult and often very costly; or they find that they have to undergo further training which they had not expected to do. Many people who expect to find work in skilled and professional areas find themselves instead without work or having to accept work for which they are not suited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has suggested that there should be a Bureau of Immigration Research. A lot of decisions-and this may explain why there is a lot of confusion in the community about immigration-are made without any detailed government research having been undertaken into our immigration policies, how those policies evolve and what the outcomes are. I think it would be a step in the right direction if we became aware of what we were doing. We need to look at the total number of migrants, what happens to them and whether, as is said by the Government and the Opposition, migrants do create a higher standard of living and will continue to do so in the future. A number of concerns have been expressed by environmental groups and others that there is a limit to the numbers that this country can take. It is a big country, but there are relatively small areas where people can live with a reasonably high standard of living, to which we are now accustomed. With the soil degradation that we have engendered and the lack of plentiful water supplies, this question does need to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also be looking at whether we should be bringing in migrants in a category of skills when there is an unacceptable level of unemployment. A recommendation has been made by the FitzGerald Committee, which the Government has accepted, that, in addition to importing migrants on a skills basis, we should be looking to education, training and retraining. The Democrats are not satisfied that enough is being done in that direction. All too often, government panders to business and industry which want skilled people here and now and are not prepared to play their part in the training of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that decision making within his Department will be made by the Secretary to the Department. It is stated in one of the releases put out by the Minister that in future the Secretary to the Department will be the principal decision maker in immigration cases. The Australian Democrats are not very happy about that. We believe it is the Minister's role to be responsible for decisions and to be involved in decision making. We are pleased to see that the Minister will still retain discretion. However many rules we have, wherever we go with the points system ultimately, there will always be cases that fall outside the system and cannot be categorised so easily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats disagree with the Government's response to recommendations 17 and 71. In recommendation 17, FitzGerald recommends legislation to ensure equal employment opportunities for migrants. We certainly endorse that; the Government does not. We also endorse FitzGerald's recommendations that fees should be waived in cases of extreme hardship. I was very disappointed to see that the Government did not endorse that recommendation either. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at the fees that migrants have to pay. They are very high. On application for processing, a prospective migrant has to pay $200. Of course, the process may finish right there. If the applicant wants to apply for reconsideration of a Migration Act decision through the Immigration Review Panel, that costs another $240. An application for change of status to permanent resident costs $315. An application for a further temporary entry permit costs $50 and an application for an entry permit giving permission to engage in employment in Australia costs a further $60. Other fees that can be charged include those relating to sponsorship for entry to Australia for temporary residents, application for a resident return visa, application for a declaratory certificate of Australian citizenship, application for the registration of Australian citizenship by descent, application for the grant of Australian citizenship, application for an evidentiary certificate of Australian citizenship and application for resumption of Australian citizenship. That seems to be quite a money making area for the Government. I am not convinced that all those--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is a lot for people without the proper means to pay. Very often, applicants are people who need work but cannot work for various reasons because they are in the process of migrating. That does seem very heavy going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have limited my remarks to the Government's response to the FitzGerald report as such. The Minister also tabled his report on deportations. I have had a quick look at it and it does seem to be a step in the right direction, but it needs to be looked at in further detail. It is quite a weighty document. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Australian Democrats wish to reaffirm their commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We refuse to regard people as mere economic units. We believe it is a gross error of judgment to deliberately import migrants on a skills basis while we have an unacceptable level of unemployment. We believe that, in order to encourage cohesion in our society, it is correct that a high emphasis should be placed on humanitarian and family categories of immigration. With all that has been said about the family by the Government and especially by the Opposition in recent days, I believe they would fall in with that. We cannot support any increase in the total immigration numbers because of unemployment and because of our need in Australia for sustainable economic and environmental policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are details in the Minister's response which need further detailed consideration. The Australian Democrats reaffirm that we consider Australia to be one multicultural Australia, which is an example to the world of democratic pluralism in action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1988, which sets up the framework to sell off 30 per cent of a newly created subsidiary of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) to the public. I have an amendment to the motion that this Bill be now read a second time. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should sell the Australian Industry Development Corporation in its entirety to the private sector as soon as possible in view of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the fact that the Corporation operates as a commercial enterprise and furthermore that there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal Government ownership; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance has interjected that the AIDC has a rather better record than those two bodies, and I agree with the Minister. Certainly, it is not an implication of the amendment that the AIDC has the sorry record of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation or the Western Australian State Government's general intervention in private enterprise matters which will cost the taxpayers of Western Australia very dearly indeed. The taxpayers of both Victoria and Western Australia have reason to regret that their governments have tried to become entrepreneurial and that will ultimately be at considerable cost to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one should really be celebratory in speaking to this Bill. It is not really appropriate to quote the New Testament in debate in this place but it does say something about there being more joy in heaven and on earth over one sinner who repents than over 10 just men who are saved. In the case of the Government moving towards even the partial privatisation of one of its statutory bodies, I suppose we should not be churlish. We should be celebrating the change of heart that this measure represents. Therefore, to some extent I am prepared to congratulate the Government for moving at least partially down the road which has been advocated by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> One gets a range of opinions about the AIDC. It has been described in very complimentary terms by Government Ministers when it has suited them. When the Government was engaging in anti-privatisation diatribes in about 1985-86, accusing anybody who advocated privatisation as wishing to wantonly plunder the public sector for private profit, the AIDC was mentioned in quite warm and glowing terms by a number of senior Government Ministers. For some reason there has been a change of heart on the part of at least some Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated to read the report of 8 June of what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had to say about the AIDC. He said some things which I found slightly extraordinary, but they are worth repeating to show the diverse attitudes which have been adopted by this Government. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Why should the funds of superannuation members, who are mostly just workers, be put across to some genius so-called in the AIDC to invest it for him? . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``What do you think that every investment manager out there in the AMP Society or National Mutual or the other 300,000 funds is? A lemon? . . . the funds can only be invested wisely by someone at the AIDC, which is just a government merchant bank?</PARA>
<PARA> By the way, it's a government merchant bank which has conned two-thirds of the party . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There's a whole lot of bureaucrats out there having a great time in O'Connell Street . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article notes, incidentally, that the AIDC is not in O'Connell Street, it is apparently in Jamieson Street, but I am not sure. In any event, Mr Keating went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pumping money into it, saying: This is good, the Labor Party likes us. We should keep pumping money into this and, as you know, we've got the Left up there barracking for more capital for us. </PARA>
<PARA> They're laughing all the way to their big lunch. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating said that what the Left was saying was: ``Instead of all these super funds actually putting money where they think they can invest it best in equities, we say, `No, we've got a better solution, we'll regulate a bit of it off you and send it down to the AIDC'.''</PARA>
<PARA>I think these must be comments relating to the Australian Council of Trade Unions' Australia Reconstructed, which suggested that the AIDC should be some sort of permanent part of the landscape which would accept sequestered funds from the superannuation savings of the Australian work force and the AIDC would have a voice in where these funds should be invested. It might be helpful in this debate if the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) could indicate whether the Government has any intention of sequestering the funds of Australian workers and giving the AIDC a role of the sort that the ACTU has advocated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are entitled to know whether the intentions of the Government are in that direction. In any event, I do not think that the Minister should be cross at my quoting the Treasurer. After all, the Treasurer, as I understand it, is still regarded as a senior spokesman for the Government and although his leadership ambitions seem to have been pushed back a week or two, notwithstanding Senator Button's support, he still speaks for the Party and for the Government. Mr Keating stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the public-private bureaucrats down there can actually have a bigger fund to walk around doing deals, and be the big dogs on the street . . . saying, `We've got all this money here. What's your proposition? Just step this way; we'll have a look at it for you'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kevin Heffernan from the AIDC responded:</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds like (Mr Keating) doesn't like us very much. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that if the AIDC brings that same nicety and precision of judgment that Mr Heffernan brought to Mr Keating's remark, I am sure it has a very big future indeed. I remind the Senate that the whole notion of privatisation-this is, of course, partial privatisation because 30 per cent is to be floated off to the public-is something which was very severely attacked and spoken of by the Government in terms which are worth repeating because they are a reminder of how suspicious one should be when this Government is at its most emphatic. The Hon. Paul Keating, who seemed in those reported comments of this year to be a bit critical about the public interest element of the AIDC, talking back in 1985 when he was playing a very hard political game on the issue of privatisation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>No matter where one looks, whether it be at TAA or the other authorities, there is no case for the Opposition's argument in economics, except simply to indulge ideologically in a Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try and destroy these authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Keating was saying back in May 1985. He said that the sale of a whole series of bodies which he mentioned, including the Australian Industry Development Corporation, `is simply vandalism of Australia's great public authorities'. At the same time he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>One can go on and on. The Prime Minister had a few purple passages about this subject too. Again it is a reminder of how little credit we should give the statements of the present Prime Minister. The Prime Minister described privatisation as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a one-off fire sale, a sale of the century, of your assets-the assets of the people of Australia. They-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the dreadful people from the Liberal and National parties-</PARA>
<PARA>would transfer them into the hands of a privileged few, to the cost of every one of us. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose Mr Hawke, in some magic way, will ensure that the AIDC is not sold to a privileged few. I ask the Minister in his response to indicate what restrictions, if any, will be placed on potential shareholders, and to ensure that this is not a transfer, in the words of his leader, `to a privileged few'. Again, I have literally dozens of similar quotes from the Prime Minister and the Hon. Bill Hayden in his then capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr Hayden actually referred to people who wanted to sell public enterprises as economic Moonies, which again is a reminder of the colourful turn of phrase which we assume he will drop as Governor-General which will be sadly missed, I am sure, in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> This attitude of the Australian Labor Party, which was even reflected in some of the statements of Senator Peter Walsh, who is normally a little more hard-headed in these matters, continued through 1985 to 1986. Indeed, the Prime Minister went back to it after he had his flirtation with a pro-privatise position when, in September 1987, he talked about it as being economic and social vandalism. Again, that is an illustration of the quite erratic approach the Government has adopted. Senator Peter Walsh, for example, in November 1985, very effectively attacked the South Australian Government which was concerned to privatise-I think my recollection is right when I say that it was concerned simply to partially privatise-some State Government assets. He talked about it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Olsen says that he will fund his tax cuts by selling assets. That is another way of saying that he will liquidate assets in order to find current expenditure. We all know where that road leads. If one keeps going down that road for long enough, one finishes up insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no acknowledgment from Senator Peter Walsh at that time that there could be considerable virtues-virtues for quite different reasons-in promoting private ownership of some public assets. Debt reduction is one reason. In some cases there can be an encouragement of competition. Indeed, if Senator Peter Walsh bothered to look at the documents which have been published by the Opposition with respect to privatisation, he would find a great deal of attention being given to the notion that one of the most fundamental reasons to privatise is to increase competition where that can be done. That is not the only reason. As I said before, the record of the Victorian and Western Australian Labor governments with respect to their intervention in investment decisions through State instrumentalities is a sharp reminder that the very fact of government backing can of itself be a danger. It can lead to decisions, which on the surface are normal entrepreneurial risk decisions being taken, forgetting, of course, that the people taking the decisions do not run the risk of bankruptcy, of losing their assets, which provides a controlling mechanism in terms of the investment decisions of private corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make one further quotation from Bob Hawke and the sort of silly-effective, of course-and ultimately destructive campaign which members of the Labor Party ran principally in 1985 and 1986 and which, of course, turned around and bit them in the backside when they tried to reform their policy in this area and their Party revolted, having been suitably converted by the rhetoric of 1985 and 1986. I am glad to see Senator McKiernan smile because I am sure that he did not need the rhetoric of 1985 and 1986 to convert him. I am sure that he is solidly in favour of public ownership of these great national enterprises. I do not say that in any disparaging way. Senator McKiernan has come into this chamber with some strong political views and I am sure that that would be one of them. He can correct me if I am wrong. I am sure that he did not need the rhetoric of 1985 and 1986. It is no wonder that the Labor Party gave Mr Hawke and his Government a lot of trouble when they tried to change their privatisation policy. In January 1986, Mr Hawke stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation is simply a flash way of saying they would flog off the assets of the people to their rich friends in private enterprise so that a select few could make profits out of those services which are profitable and the rest of Australia could go hang . . . ideologues tucked away in a mansion in Sydney . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not a wonderful phrase? Does it not conjure up all the prejudice which has been so vital to keeping the Labor Party together over the years-those ideologues stuck in mansions in Sydney? Mr Hawke continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . think it would be a good idea to flog off the Bank, flog off Telecom so that a few people get rich providing some services at a price and a profit which suits them. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that there is any intellectual belief in those numerous quotations. It is a small selection, however, of the quotations available to us. I do not believe that the Ministers at the table, Senator Walsh and Senator Button, believed for a moment the nonsense that they were talking in 1985 and 1986. It was just a pathetic and negative contribution to an important public debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Button can claim to have said nothing, his position in this argument will be a proud one indeed. I congratulate him on it. Senator Walsh has made some sensible contributions, some of them quite recently. Indeed, I want to quote Senator Walsh shortly because I think there are things to be said in his favour. The confusion in the Labor Party since 1986 is something that again I could enjoy, but I should not take up too much of the Senate's time on that. It is splendid to see this wonderful public debate with Mr Langmore, Clyde Cameron and Gareth Evans. Gareth Evans really summed up the dilemma for the Government. This is splendid vintage Evans, which explains why the debate has been so disorderly. Evans said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My heart, like those in the Labor Party, continues to tug in the direction of public ownership, but my head tells me that if we sweep privatisation off the table, we may be condemning some of these enterprises to death-either instant or by slow strangulation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a good Evans phrase. It sums up the problem that the Labor Party recently has tried to come to grips with. Is it going to privatise these great public enterprises by seeing them become irrelevant, by seeing them wither away, is it going to give them access to capital through the Budget, or is it going to enable them to go into the private market? Broadly they are the choices which the Government faces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has disclosed that there are massive capital requirements for Qantas, for Australian Airlines and for the Commonwealth Bank. The AIDC is a tiny drop in the ocean. It is a very small part of what is required. I congratulate Senator Button on having been able, at least, to steer this tiny element of privatisation through the Government and the Cabinet. The much larger issues, the issues of our state-owned airlines and the issue of the Commonwealth Bank, have yet to be tackled in any realistic or effective way by the Government. But I welcome the fact that we have had from the Government a number of statements which make it clear that it has come up, looked around and realised that the economic arguments are totally contrary to the sort of populist nonsense, the sort of doctrinaire rubbish, that was a feature of Government statements on this matter in 1985-86. Note the different tone in the Treasurer's comments of April 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>The question needs to be asked: How can the public sector serve our traditional goals of social progress and equity? . . . Some assets may be used more efficiently outside the public sector. Sales of some assets would certainly relieve the Budget of ongoing subventions and, of course, all assets (sales) produce a capital appropriation to the Budget which either retires debt or slows down the buildup of debt and hence relieves the Budget of its very high public debt instruments commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>So the issue of efficiency is raised. The issue of relieving the Budget of ongoing subventions is raised. The fact that debt may be reduced is raised. These are all matters which were brought forward by the Opposition and have been brought forward by the Opposition for the last five or so years. The Prime Minister underwent a similar conversion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must, for example, examine whether the need to further reduce Budget outlays and the public sector borrowing requirement is itself constraining the ability of the Government to provide the capital which some publicly owned enterprises need to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. Freed of these constraints, these enterprises may become more efficient and more viable-an outcome which could only benefit consumers, taxpayers and the employees of the enterprise itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is in sharp and quite amazing contrast with the rubbish that the Prime Minister was speaking in his earlier comments that I have quoted. I will not quote, because I would not wish to flatter the Minister at the table, Senator Walsh, who is more distinguished for his offensive remarks about individuals outside the House in the Opposition than for anything that would warrant my quoting him with approval. But Senator Walsh, in a number of speeches, made some hard points to his own constituency in the Labor Party, no doubt, about the economic reasons for wishing to privatise. One has to ask why the Government needs to be in this business at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it about the AIDC which is peculiar and which it can do only if it is partly or wholly publicly owned? The last time I had a discussion with someone from the AIDC it was a quite informal discussion with the Chairman, Sir Gordon Jackson, who still seemed to be insisting that the AIDC did things which would not be done by a private organisation. A very senior member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation who was present during the same conversation expressed great scepticism about that. The very small projects which are undertaken by the AIDC such as the malaria matter could certainly be done by the Government without the need for this publicly owned merchant bank, as it has been described by Treasurer Keating. We should welcome not only the conversion of the Government to the notion of there being some greater private ownership but also the conversion of the AIDC itself. One finds on page 5 of the 1988 AIDC annual report these comments:</PARA>

<PARA>To sustain the growth of equity investment, however, the capital base of the corporation must be enlarged. To this end the corporation explored alternative sources of capital and last year recommended to the Government the raising of private capital from the market to supplement Government capital. The proposal was favourably received by our Minister, Senator the Hon John N. Button, Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. With his strong support and encouragement the Board resolved to maintain the impetus of the Corporation's investment growth for the year in anticipation of a favourable outcome. The proposal was approved by Cabinet early in August 1988 and legislation to facilitate its implementation is to be introduced during the Budget sittings of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to this because I also wanted to advert to the original briefing I sought from the AIDC through Sir Gordon Jackson when I was first shadowing Senator Button. For the record, the very strong objection he made to me regarding any suggestion of privatisation of the AIDC should be noted. The reason I want to put that on the record is that the very strong view he expressed was accompanied by an equally strong statement that the AIDC itself would campaign against the proposition of the privatisation and that the AIDC was extremely influential-it had influence, for example, with the education profession, particularly science teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> This is relevant to public debate because there is some difficulty for the operation of Government, Opposition and the sort of society we want when government-funded bodies seek to exert a political influence on matters of public policy of that sort. I have some doubt in my mind that that is an appropriate function for the AIDC. Whilst I would be quite sure that no such view would be expressed in the minutes and the records of the company, I was extremely surprised to find that view being put to me by somebody who was in the position of Sir Gordon Jackson. It demonstrates the dangers to the public of this sort of public involvement in what should be private enterprise. I note that the Minister snorts. I think that is a fair description of his non-verbal, or non-oral, interjection. I think the matter is of some importance. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent to which the Government reaches into this sort of enterprise, there is a risk of a distortion of the processes of argument and debate. I am pleased that the AIDC now seems to have a quite contrary view to the view which was expressed to me, as I say, when I sought a briefing about the AIDC and its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill tries to get over the difficulties in which the Government finds itself because of its earlier absurd rhetoric which was, in part, built around a desire to see the Bannon Government returned and which resulted in intemperate, inaccurate and stupid attacks on the Olsen Opposition. That led to a situation which proved to be politically unmanageable for the Government when it sought to change its policy in this area. It is interesting that as recently as late October this year Senator Walsh was reported as rekindling the privatisation debate when he raised the financing problems of Qantas and Australian Airlines. In a speech to a Canberra seminar on financing government enterprise, Senator Walsh said that one option for providing private sector equity for Qantas and Australian Airlines was to set up subsidiaries. He referred to the decision, which is being implemented by this Bill, to have a subsidiary of the AIDC and to float that as something that could meet the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that it will get the support of the Opposition for measures which move down the track in the constructive way that the Opposition has been saying for some years we should move. For that reason, the amendment I have moved is not an amendment which seeks to defeat the Bill but simply to record our view that the Bill does not go far enough. I do not believe that the Minister will be able to demonstrate that there is any real reason why the 30 per cent should not be 100 per cent. I say in anticipation of what the Minister might say that the public interest assignments that might be given to the AIDC by government could be handled in a quite different way, just as the Government has now adopted the idea of privatisation with respect to defence homes, where subsidised mortgages at concessional rates, provided to ex-servicemen as part of their remuneration, effectively, to acknowledge their contribution to Australia, continue to be provided through the agency of a private bank, the mortgages having been sold off by the Commonwealth under an agreement which guarantees the continuance of the beneficial conditions that are enjoyed by those defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one example of the way public purposes can be achieved by arrangements between government and the private sector. One does not need a merchant bank or a bank to achieve that. It is perhaps worthy of remark that it was not necessary for the Government to come to some arrangement with the government-owned bank-the Commonwealth Bank-to achieve its objectives. Presumably, Westpac made a better tender than the Commonwealth Bank and, therefore, got the contract. That simply demonstrates that in that and every other area one cares to nominate arrangements could be made without the need to own a bank, a merchant bank or whatever one might wish to describe the Australian Industry Development Corporation as being. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's view is that there are no public interest reasons for maintaining government involvement in the AIDC. It acts as a commercial enterprise. It is, as the Treasurer has described it, just a government merchant bank and only a very small proportion of its funds are targeted towards development or venture capital. The Corporation has developed some expertise in manufacturing and tourism finance, but this can be and has been developed in the private sector as well in response to market demand. I believe that no serious argument can be put forward to maintain the public form of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that is of some concern is that floating off only 30 per cent means that those people who invest in the bank will be permanent minority shareholders. Whilst it is true that legal protections are given to minority shareholders, those protections are often cumbersome and expensive if one needs to avail oneself of them. I commend the Bill for speedy passage and I commend the amendment I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My admiration is absolutely unlimited for Senator Chaney's ability to get up and fill exactly half an hour with speech irrespective of the importance or otherwise of a matter, but I cannot say the same about his reference to Senator Evans's remarks, which he repeated, in relation to privatisation. It seems quite clear to me that what Senator Evans was saying was that it was politically unwise, not economically unwise, not to go down the road of privatisation, the reason being that, the Labor Government having ensured that most of the media are now in the hands of very few individuals and those individuals are extremely powerful in the private sector, it would be unwise not to put more financial power and resources into their hands because those media outlets have the means to make or break the Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not at all impressed with Senator Chaney's disparaging remarks regarding the retention in public ownership of public assets. While he said that it is economic nonsense to retain many of these assets, he provided not one shred of evidence to support that claim. In fact, the evidence goes the other way. He posed the rhetorical question: what is there about public ownership which is not also shared with private ownership in terms of the public interest? It is precisely that. It is the public interest which is not served by private ownership. Private ownership has one motivation and that is to maximise profits to those individuals who own the shares or company. Those private companies can in no sense serve the public interest. If they do so it is by accident and not by design. The other major advantage of public ownership is that the profits from those organisations which are profitable flow back to the public and not to those few individuals who happen to be fortunate enough to own the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) was created in 1970. It operates principally as a provider of capital to various firms for development, particularly those with an export orientation, and for the promotion of Australian industry. The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill seeks to flog off 30 per cent of the organisation to private interests-in other words, to gut the organisation as such, to establish a subsidiary which becomes a public company, and float off 30 per cent of the shares to private interests. When the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) introduced the Bill in the other place he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the listed subsidiary should not be construed as a partial privatisation of AIDC, but rather as an opportunity for the public to share in the national development objectives of AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA>If anything is newspeak, that is it. That is a clear misstatement of what is going on. This is partial privatisation. I draw attention to the fact that about 7 per cent of the Australian public own shares in companies. Ninety-three per cent of the Australian population do not own shares. To talk about an opportunity for the public to share in a national development corporation is arrant nonsense. It is also being deliberately deceitful in relation to telling the Australian public what this is about. That share ownership translates through into the relative share of wealth owned by various sections of the Australian community. I remind the Senate that one per cent of Australians own 25 per cent of this country's wealth; 5 per cent own 50 per cent; and 10 per cent own 60 per cent. Of course, that means that the remaining 90 per cent of the population share but 40 per cent of the total wealth of this country. Further on in the Minister's speech in the House of Representatives we find:</PARA>
<PARA>No single private person or associated group will be permitted to hold more than 10 per cent of the subsidiary's voting equity. </PARA>
<PARA>As we are talking about $50m we are talking about one person owning $5m. I simply pose the question: How many Australians have the wherewithal to go in and buy shares to that value? What an absolute deception to say, on the one hand, that this is not partial privatisation and to claim on the other hand, that this is some sort of an opportunity by which the public can share in the national development objectives of the AIDC!</PARA>
<PARA> We also find on page 2 of the Minister's statement that this is a very effective and profitable organisation. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Corporation has experienced a period of very strong asset growth of over 250 per cent in the four years to 30 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are not talking about an organisation which is in any sense a lame duck. Private interests would not be keen to take over such an organisation. We are talking about an organisation which is of considerable benefit to the Australian public because it is performing very well. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the general proposition that there is no evidence whatsoever that, in general, public organisations work less well than private organisations. There is no evidence whatsoever that the free operation of the market serves the common good. The idea first floated, I think by Adam Smith, that some invisible hand would guide competitive greed towards the serving of the common good is simply an a prior assumption without basis. Moreover, if one looks at the mathematics of the so-called level playing field that the Opposition likes talking about so much-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Government and Opposition. I will come to that point in a moment, because here we have both sides in bed together on this one. The operation of a competitive market system in no sense will maintain the sort of stability in which that market can persist indefinitely, and that is readily demonstrable mathematically. The level playing field, the operation of the pure market that is talked about so often and so flippantly without any intellectual justification, is simply a very unstable situation which will, of itself, always hunt towards a monopoly position. Of course, if one looks at the operation of the market in practice, one sees that that is exactly what happens. Markets rapidly move towards monopoly positions; the very few become extremely rich and the rest go to the wall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So there is no evidence whatsoever to support the assertion made by Senator Chaney that privatisation, plus the operation of the market system, will serve the common interest. I was disgusted to hear Senator Chaney quote the New Testament as a source of justification for partial privatisation. To argue that putting more wealth in the hands of the few who are already wealthy somehow has some religious basis in fact is like the sort of assertion that was made the other night by Senator Puplick when he talked about the Australian Democrats maintaining the politics of greed. I suggest that it is the Opposition and the Government that are very much the merchants of the politics of greed in serving the interests of the already wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said earlier this afternoon by an honourable senator in this place that it takes two to tango. Of course, what we see in this place is that the two that are tangoing are the Government and the Opposition. There is very little to choose between the New Right economics which are proposed by the Opposition and the Hawke-Keating or, indeed, the Walsh-Button economics, which are the same thing; and this is an example of that. The differences between the coalition and the Hawke-Keating Government are just differences of degree, and I think we see that in the amendment which Senator Chaney has proposed and which the Democrats will certainly reject. While the Government would privatise 30 per cent of this organisation, the Opposition would go the whole way. No doubt a few years down the track the Government would also privatise the remainder in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of both groups are designed to win the approval of bankers and business people. They are designed to win the approval of those who are already rich and who are already privileged. They are policies that Mr Fraser flirted with in theory but not in practice. They are economic policies based on the assumption that it is bad for a government to own public enterprises, and to regulate, spend or borrow to achieve socially desirable aims; or, conversely, that private ownership and private borrowing with little or no government regulation is automatically good. Of course, what follows from privatisation is that the more privatisation one has, the more it needs to be regulated, because it is simply profit seeking and it does not serve the common good, so we must put in place regulation. The Democrats' point is that it is far better to keep these things in public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> These economic assumptions of the Opposition and the Government created the squalor, the misery and the poverty of dickensian England. While the free marketeers and the racketeers made fortunes, the rest of the population lived in poverty. That is precisely where this market-driven privatisation would eventually lead. We have a Labor Government that has deregulated financial markets. It harps about the need to reduce government borrowing; it peddles privatisation, and it reduces Government expenditure to the detriment of low income Australians so that it can achieve what it calls a balanced Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In turning to the alternative approaches, one finds, on page 3 of the statement, that Mr Jones has set out the problems which were being confronted by the AIDC and the way in which those problems could be dealt with. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government examined a number of options: firstly, to continue as at present;-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to maintain the existing structure and the accumulation of assets by the process which has been going on since 1970-</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, to provide a substantial capital instalment from the budget; or, thirdly, to raise equity capital from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the list finishes. Of course, the fourth alternative-and this is one of the things which neither the Government nor the Opposition is prepared to look at-is that in exactly the same way that the private banks create credit out of thin air, so the Commonwealth or the Reserve Bank of Australia could create the credit for this organisation. That is a process that has been used in the past. It has been used to support the Wheat Board with interest free credit, until the money from the harvest came in, so that farmers could receive credit, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) may well have received some of this money himself when he was a wheat producer. In the past the Reserve Bank has also given to the States loans at a one per cent interest rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was making the point that Senator Chaney had said that it was a Christian virtue to give more to the rich and take from the poor. I was also making the point that there was another way of raising capital for the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC)-namely, that the Government itself could create credit. When I gave several examples of how that had been done in Australia, that brought the rejoinder from the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that as soon as he was able to he would stop that practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that there is a considerable tradition behind the Government being the sole credit creation authority. Indeed, I believe that just before the turn of the century the Australian Labor Party itself proposed the creation of the Commonwealth Bank precisely because it recognised that the Government should be the sole credit creation authority. I remember that one of the great Labor Prime Ministers of this country, Ben Chifley, also had something to say about the private banks having the sole credit creation capability. I also remember the problems which that caused for this country. One knows what happened to Ben Chifley and what the Opposition did when he came up with that proposal. It is worth while making this point because honourable senators may not understand that the banks do not lend the money that is deposited with them. In fact, they lend approximately 10 times as much money as is deposited with them. When a bank creates an overdraft for someone, it simply creates a book entry of a debt to that person and a credit to itself. Moreover, it does not create the money which will pay the interest on that overdraft, so necessarily the banks become richer and those who go into debt by way of overdraft become poorer. There is abundant evidence to support this. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote Professor Hotson, professor of economics at Toronto University, whose remarks bear very much on the way in which this public instrumentality, which the Australian Democrats are saying should remain a public instrumentality, should obtain its extra finance; they also bear on the position of other public utilities which this Government seeks to privatise. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first rule of public finance should be, `no government should ever borrow any money from any private bank.' It can create the needed money, interest and debt free, through its Treasury Department, or the second best solution, borrow from its publicly-owned Central Bank at say, half of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> But would not such a policy be wildly inflationary? Absolutely not, provided at the same time as zero or low interest money is being fed into the economy, the reserve requirements on commercial banks are raised successively to prevent an explosion of bank credit. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, taking away from the private banks the credit creation capacity which they now have and vesting that with a public bank. Professor Hotson continued:</PARA>
<PARA>For not only is bank credit the real source of all inflation in our age, it is also the source of business depressions that so mar the history of capitalism.</PARA>
<PARA>I now quote what Professor John Kenneth Galbraith had to say on exactly the same matter-the creation of money. Galbraith wrote a book called Money-Whence it Came, Where It Went in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The process by which banks create credit is so simple that the mind is repelled. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me a repugnant observation that this Government, supported by this Opposition, is prepared to go to the private banks and put publicly owned corporations such as the AIDC into hock to those who are already wealthy rather than use the instruments that are available to them to create that credit through bodies such as the Reserve Bank of Australia or the Commonwealth Bank, which are already owned by the Government. Indeed, we heard Senator Chaney this afternoon talk about the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. We have also heard those sorts of statements from certain Government senators. That would herald the end of a rational, sensible economic system in this country, oriented towards public benefit rather than private gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Other simple means are available by which this organisation can remain publicly owned and can expand its capital base for the benefit of the public and those companies for which it was set up, and moreover, without the need to go into hock to private capital. We believe that that should be done. We oppose the sale of 30 per cent of this instrumentality. We certainly oppose the Opposition's attempt to privatise the AIDC completely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, having just listened to an example of breathtaking antediluvianism, that it is rather incredible to imagine that there can be rational economic debate on a subject such as this-the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1988. There seem to be some who are locked in a time warp and are not prepared to face the reality of what the consequences would be if we accepted Senator Walsh's figure, that $8 billion to $10 billion could be necessary in order to provide sufficient capital even to allow for an expansion of the operation of Government business enterprises in the transport and communications sectors. One must really ask why it is that the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) is in the business that it is in. Certainly, the only conclusion I can reach is that it is a convenient vehicle for patronage on the part of the Government. It has a list of 12 worthy luminaries on its board, who no doubt get a great deal of kudos from attending board meetings and waxing lyrical about all the marvellous things they are doing, but at the end of the day they are not doing one thing that could not be done by the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice, for example, that the activities of the AIDC in recent years have been as diverse as being a major lender in the first phase of the Woodside Petroleum Ltd North West Shelf project; putting together funding for the Wesfarmers liquefied petroleum gas plant in Western Australia; putting equity and debt into the Hyatt Hotel in Melbourne; and putting equity and debt into the five star Fairmont Resort at Leura in the Blue Mountains. I do not understand why any of those activities could not have been wholly financed by the private sector. Nonetheless, it is probably illuminating to quote one of the directors of the AIDC, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>We need a greater equity base to support what we want to do. So far we have not been greatly constrained, but we have had a number of opportunities into which we could have put funding if we had it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a classic approach to business. If one regards oneself as having an entitlement to get involved in a whole range of private sector activities, it is very difficult to imagine what other constraint there could be, apart from capital. For example, the annual report proudly boasts:</PARA>
<PARA>AIDC takes pride in being Australia's foremost development financier and investor. We are a government enterprise operating in a thoroughly commercial manner. </PARA>
<PARA>When one looks to the second reading speech of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) for a justification of the activities of the AIDC, the most one finds is this sort of pap:</PARA>
<PARA>AIDC's ability to provide both loan and equity capital across the spectrum of new and old industries is a key characteristic which differentiates it from other financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is as though the average merchant bank or investment bank is not able to provide debt or equity capital for a range of new and old industries. It is absolute nonsense. The Minister's second reading speech also contains this similar feeble effort:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the public interest roles expected of AIDC, which remain the raison d'etre for its continued presence in the public sector . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We ask: What are the public interest roles expected of the AIDC? One should bear in mind that this Bill supposedly provides amendments that take the AIDC and all its brethren into the brave new world that Senator Evans was not quite prepared to tackle. He mouthed the rhetoric and nodded in the right direction, but dropped the ball before he reached the goal line. If we take this as an example and look at these amendments and see what is left we find that the AIDC Act is still riddled with a whole range of interventionist entitlements:</PARA>
<PARA>Enterprises or projects in the national interest</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, from time to time . . . inform the Corporation of the policy of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>There are requirements for reports back and forth:</PARA>
<PARA>the Corporation shall furnish to the Minister a report in writing in relation to the enterprise or project. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters to be taken into account by the Corporation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the performance of its functions the Corporation shall have regard to the current monetary policy of the Commonwealth Government . . . in relation to trade practices, the environment, industrial relations, urban and regional development and the efficiency of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(3) The Corporate shall . . . have regard to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the importance of the industry concerned to the Australian economy;</PARA>
<PARA>These are just words. It is nonsense. It is a generalised blueprint for providing carte blanche involvement and intervention. I cannot see that this Bill will do much in that regard. All it is really doing is providing a convenient justification for what is nothing more nor less than a charade for those in the Australian Labor Party who have not quite got the stomach to talk in terms of corporatisation, let alone privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had this artificial device served up of providing a separate listing vehicle that will be able to raise 30 per cent from the public. It is unwieldy, it is unnecessary, it is indirect and at the end of the day, of course, it will be underwritten directly by an explicit guarantee from the Government because all borrowings will be undertaken by the holding company, the AIDC. It is a complete and utter nonsense. It is just a fiction to disguise the inability of Senator Gareth Evans and his colleagues to persuade the majority of the troglodytes in his Party as to the virtues of privatisation, which are blindingly obvious to most of those who have turned their minds to this subject. I include in that category Senator Walsh because I was intrigued to read a recent speech of his to the Business Law Education Centre in Canberra on 24 August last. I note his conversion to Thatcherism, which is somewhat surprising in one sense given the faction to which he belongs. Nonetheless, here it is:</PARA>
<PARA>Until six weeks ago I had regarded the Thatcher model for the transfer to private ownership of government enterprises as a cynical attempt to raise a large amount of money to fund election winning tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney said before the dinner adjournment that in November 1985 Senator Walsh was talking about going down the insolvency road. We all know that he has been down the Argentinean road and presumably as a result of this little exercise he has been down the Damascus road or perhaps even the Cyprus road because he says this:</PARA>
<PARA> On my way to the recent Commonwealth Finance Ministers Conference in Cyprus, I spent a few days in London where some things became clear to me. Privatisation had not been conceived as a cynical exercise to raise revenue-though no doubt it is a present objective. The original objective was to make public enterprises more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that was an impeccable goal and an admirable objective and one that even Senator Walsh freely acknowledges, and I think to his credit has acknowledged at least for the last several years. It should be blindingly apparent that one of the great difficulties facing government business enterprises is their inability to raise sufficient capital and certainly to get the hand-outs to which they would like to become accustomed from government. It is simply far beyond the capacity of any government, even one with a $5.7 billion revenue surplus which no doubt is going to be distributed with such great profligacy on about 1 July next year. Nonetheless, if we are talking seriously about providing the funds necessary, the Government does not have the capacity to deliver. Senator Walsh acknowledges that and recognises the reality and makes it clear that privatisation makes a great deal of sense.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say I was quite intrigued to see him giving some very friendly advice to the Opposition. He said this, for example:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National party coalition in this country should bear these points in mind as they proceed with the development of their own privatisation policy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very gentle and kindly stuff. It is about as close as one could get to an explicit endorsement of coalition policy in this area. He then proceeded to list all of the targets that he thought we had on the drawing board. In fact, he left off the Commonwealth Bank. Nonetheless, he proceeded to make a few pejorative comments. He did not in any way question the underlying rationale, or the need, for privatisation of any of those enterprises. At the end of the day he knows the problems he faces within his own party. That is why this unfortunate method has been adopted in this instance. Senator Walsh simply put it forward as one possible method for achieving equity from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is that. It does not go far enough, as we have made very clear. In a sense it is a mirrors and beads exercise because at the end of the day partial privatisation will inevitably lead, in due course, to calls for full privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> If one analyses the objectives of the AIDC, what is required in the private sector and the capacity of other investment banks to deliver the capital requirements, it will inevitably transpire that the AIDC will not need to remain in the public sector. We welcome that. We regard that as simply a realistic acknowledgment that the AIDC does not need to be in the business of picking winners, that it should take its chances out in the private sector. If it is as good as its annual report says it is, no doubt it will continue to thrive. It has been let off any dividend repayment this year because of the shortage of capital. Unless it is it will shrink in the same way that the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines, for example, have been taken to the cleaners by their competitors. That is a deliberate, callous and cynical result of this Government's intransigence in the area, its refusal to face up to economic reality and its determination to provide massive tax cuts in due course in the hope that they will save its bacon at the next election. The real losers in that little exercise are a whole range of government business enterprises that have legitimate claims on capital, not necessarily in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Bill to the extent to which it goes. It seems to me that it still does not fundamentally address the real issue of why the AIDC needs to be in the business at all. One would hope that in due course we will not need to be having this sort of debate, despite the Australian Democrats, who no doubt will maintain their economic irrelevancy in this general area. I simply say in closing that I would like an explanation at some stage of why in this package of Bills some government business enterprises are being relieved of the immunity of the shield of the Crown and others are not. In this particular instance it would seem that the AIDC remains immune. That does not seem to make sense to me. The closer we can get to putting the AIDC into actual competition with private sector competitors the better it will be for the exercise. </PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1988 provides for private equity in the AIDC which was sought by private enterprise. The Labor Government has provided that opportunity on the basis that the additional money that comes in will enlarge opportunities for companies not able to attract funds in the private banking industry. If that is a negative approach, then I am absolutely amazed. I think it is a very positive approach. The Opposition is only trying to make political capital in a very inefficient and inappropriate way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, in his rush to grab and hang on to the coat-tails of the New Right, spent a lot of time referring to the antediluvians and miscellaneous troglodytes who are still prepared to support the institution of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and, in doing so, ignored, as Senator Burns has just reminded us, a rather important piece of history; that is, that the AIDC was of course established by a conservative government. In fact, it was established in 1970 for the very purposes for which it still exists today, namely, to help finance the development and growth of Australian private enterprise in a variety of sectors, and to assist Australia in the participation and control of Australian industry. That is the objective. It was a worthy objective then and remains a worthy objective now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for those, among other reasons, that we have of course pursued this legislation designed to further streamline and make more effective and up to date in relative and contemporary terms the organisation and activities of the AIDC. It is for those reasons that we reject the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. As was stated in the second reading speech, the AIDC performs a unique function which differentiates it from other financial institutions. Under its charter, the AIDC has provided not only necessary finance for the restructuring and vitalisation of Australia's older industries but also the development of new high technology industries as well as again participating in things like anti-malaria vaccine research under the national interest provisions of the Australian Industry Development Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In this role over the years AIDC has proven to be a very effective instrument of government industry policy. The decision to allow AIDC to raise private sector equity acknowledges the capital constraint that would otherwise have limited its future capacity to contribute to industry development. To sell AIDC in its entirety to the private sector, as this amendment proposes, would see the loss of an effective arm of industry policy without any assurance that the private sector has the capacity, or indeed the willingness, to pick up the activities carried out in the past by the AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA> I will summarise in two or three paragraphs what the effect of this legislation will be. No Commonwealth assets will be sold off. The Corporation will remain 100 per cent Commonwealth owned. The purpose is rather to enable, as I have said, AIDC, through its subsidiary, to raise additional capital necessary for it to continue meeting the Government's industry policy objectives. The Government's intention, as is evident from the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill, is to approach the external capital raising it in two steps. First, the bulk of AIDC's business excluding borrowings will be transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary company with the minimum of change or distortion, such that the business would be shown in the books of the subsidiary as being in the books of AIDC prior to the transfer taking account of the indemnity arrangements and the proposed new section 29L. The subsidiary would then become the investment joint venture between Government and public, with the public providing new capital. The AIDC, with its subsidiary, will continue to play a vital role in the ongoing development of the private sector through the provision of loan and equity finance for the development, revitalisation and restructuring of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> After that very learned account, may I conclude by thanking honourable senators for their contributions to this debate, tendentious as it may have been on occasions. Nonetheless, I note the support that is on offer for the legislation and wish it a speedy passage accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall try, but I do not guarantee that I will succeed. I am sure that none of the participants in today's debate and this evening's debate would want any brevity on their part to be seen in any way as an indication of the lack of importance of this debate on Australia's future immigration policies. That is what we are in essence talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to join at the outset other speakers in congratulating Dr Stephen FitzGerald and the members of his Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies for the dedication and skill that they brought to their task and for the result of their labours. The result that they produced was one of the very best reports from any government established committee for many years. That does not mean that I agree with all the Committee's recommendations. In particular, I strongly disagree with the recommendations concerning our future Indo-Chinese refugee program. Overall, however, I do strongly support the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I also welcome the statement made today by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). It has been a long time coming. I do not criticise the present Minister, Senator Ray, for that. He has held the portfolio for only a short period, and I fully recognise the requirement to give proper consideration and processing to what was a long and complex report. But neither of these factors prevent me from placing the blame for the unnecessary delay where it quite properly lies, that is, with the former Minister, Mr Holding. Mr Holding has a dreadful record in government. He was the worst Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that this country has ever had. We have now had 11 Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs. It should be 12. If the present Minister, Mr Hand, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had any respect for ministerial integrity and parliamentary responsibility, either Mr Hand would resign or he would be sacked for misleading the Parliament on at least three separate occasions in recent weeks. Mr Holding was also arguably the second worst Minister for Immigration that this nation has ever had. The first prize, of course, goes to Mr Stewart West. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, by a street. But Mr Holding runs him a very definite second. My welcoming of Senator Ray's statement does not mean, however, that I endorse it; nor, I am sure, does Senator Ray himself. It is quite clear that Senator Ray and the Prime Minister were rolled in Cabinet on several of the major proposals. The most significant was the proposal concerning skilled migrants, but there are many others too which show conclusively that the final shape of the Government's immigration proposals has essentially been determined by the left wing of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a great deal of contact with a wide range of ethnic communities, particularly in Victoria. For example, my electorate office is located in what is probably colloquially known as the ethnic centre of Australia. I have a great deal of pleasure in the contact that I have with those communities. In this capacity I have had more than my fill of listening to the Chairman of the Government's immigration and ethnic affairs committee, the honourable member for Calwell, Dr Theophanous, railing against the findings of FitzGerald in the most distorted and hysterical fashion. Therefore, when I read in the Melbourne Sun today that Dr Theophanous had said last night, `In the final analysis, I think Cabinet has taken a very wise decision', I knew that the Government had killed the recommendations of the FitzGerald report and had bowed to the agenda of left of the Labor movement and to its industrial wing, namely, the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement today, the Minister said that the FitzGerald report `has set the broad direction for the changes I am about to announce'. The Minister must surely have had his tongue in his cheek when making that remark because nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the Government has rejected the main thrust of the FitzGerald Committee report. That thrust was that Australia's immigration program needs to be given a much sharper economic focus. This means a much greater emphasis on skilled migration than has occurred in recent years. The FitzGerald Committee made that abundantly clear in much of what it wrote in its report. For the Senate's benefit, I will quote two or three passages from that report. In its executive summary on page xii of the report, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The sharper economic focus for which the Government has called is the most central issue in immigration reform. The composition of the immigration program, and of skill levels, are critical if immigration is to contribute to enhanced economic performance. The skills profile of some groups of immigrants has fallen. The median age is rising. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state on the same page:</PARA>
<PARA> To realise its potential economic benefits to Australia, the immigration program needs a high proportion of skilled, entrepreneurial and youthful immigrants . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later, in chapter 3, at page 37 of the report, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . an immigration program of the current order of magnitude and skill composition would be likely to contribute less than 0.07 per cent per annum to national per capita income growth. </PARA>
<PARA> A larger program would raise the contribution to growth to 0.09 per cent per annum. But a larger program of highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants would make a marked contribution to economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, page 90 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that tripartite negotiated arrangements . . . be central to the allocation of points to different skills under the labour market skills factor. They should largely determine where the skill shortages are and which skills should receive the highest points. </PARA>
<PARA>It recommended that seven groups of factors should form the basis of the selection procedures, and that the first priority should be labour market skills and the second entrepreneurship and special talents. In the 5 1/2 years that the Hawke Government has been in office, the proportion of skilled migrants in our total intake has fallen from over 50 per cent to between 20 and 30 per cent. That is a massive fall. It has had a massive adverse economic impact. The FitzGerald report identified and highlighted this cost and the Committee framed its recommendations around this basic point. As I said, the Government has rejected virtually all the Committee's recommendations in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through three or four of the main recommendations. The first, recommendation 40, is that seven groups of factors should form the basis of the selection procedure, with labour market skills and entrepreneurship and special talents being the first two. That has not been accepted by the Government. Recommendation 41, which I have also read out, is that points should be determined largely to meet the skill shortages which might exist and that, therefore, certain skills should receive higher points. That recommendation has not been accepted, neither has recommendation 42, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the contribution of people with entrepreneurial skills to Australia's economic development be recognised by awarding a significant number of points for entrepreneurship, including a component on capital transfer insofar as it relates to a business venture. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main recommendation, in which the three recommendations that I have just read culminate, is recommendation 49. That is a long recommendation. The first sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the highest weightings go to the skills and entrepreneurship factors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has rejected that recommendation as well. Today the chairman of the Committee that produced the FitzGerald report, Dr Stephen FitzGerald, put out a media release in which he welcomed the Government's decisions. I understand that this statement was tabled in this chamber before dinner by Senator Schacht. Having examined the Government's statement and having outlined certain points, I find Dr FitzGerald's press release very surprising. I wonder whether he has studied the Government's decisions in detail. I wonder whether the other members of the Committee would share Dr FitzGerald's view that the Government has taken most of the thrust of the FitzGerald recommendations into account. I must say that there seem to be some errors in his press release. For example, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the bulk of the Committee's recommendation (some 80%) had in fact been accepted by Cabinet . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That figure seems to me to be extraordinarily high. I have done a count on it and my figure would come out at closer to 60 to 65 per cent, including acceptance of the motherhood recommendations of philosophy, on which there is no disagreement throughout our community. If we look at the number of recommendations for specific policy action decisions, we see that the Government has rejected well over half of the Committee's decisions and, if they are weighted out for substance, it has rejected virtually all of them. I hope that Dr FitzGerald was not leaned on too much to produce that press release today. I do not think it fully reflects the Cabinet's decision. I hope that he will have another look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to reduce the intake under the business migration program by 2000. It has produced a totally spurious and dishonest reason for that. The Minister said in his statement today:</PARA>
<PARA>The reduction reflects the expected effect of the Asian immigration debate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a totally false, dishonest, wrong statement. There are mixed views in the community on this whole debate, but it cannot be asserted with any veracity that the immigration debate has had a negative effect on business migration applications. I draw the Senate's attention to one of the few objective reports I have seen on this matter, namely, a report which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of this week, 6 December, by the Herald's Hong Kong correspondent, Mark Baker. He has some interesting things to say, having researched the matter from the Hong Kong base. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the latest government statistics show that there has been no decline so far in business migration applications from Hong Kong and Taiwan-Australia's biggest source of investor migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Australian officials and leading migration consultants based in Hong Kong can produce no cases of prospective migrants who have abandoned plans to migrate because of the controversy. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time an independent public opinion survey in Hong Kong last week indicated a surge in support for Australia as a potential migration destination . . . </PARA>
<PARA> An independent opinion poll indicated that Australia had now moved ahead of the United States and was second only to Canada as the preferred migration destination. </PARA>
<PARA>The report by Mark Baker cites various other statistics. It states that officials at the Australian Consulate General in Hong Kong say that their records and reports from migration consultants indicate that there is a backlog of about 1,200 prospective business migrants awaiting processing. The business migration agencies in Hong Kong have made statements to support the remarks that I have just made. For example, a Mr Bill Kuo, a consultant with the legal firm of Baker and McKenzie, said about the migration debate:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue has provoked a lot of discussion among our clients and a lot of people are now adopting a wait-and-see attitude, but no one has said they won't go to Australia because they think it's a racist country. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Steven Yu, of Steven Yu, McCann and Associates, one of the most active consultants in Hong Kong, said that he had seen no decline in the level of interest in business migration to Australia. So much for the nonsense and dishonesty in the Government's statements, including the Minister's statement today, I am sorry to say, about this whole aspect of business migration. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other of the Government decisions require careful consideration before one can make a firm judgment on them. I guess that we would all want to preface our remarks on the points of detail about this report by saying that we saw the Government's statement only today. There is a great deal in it and a great deal of detail in it which will need careful consideration before one can form a firm judgment. The question of a floating points system is one that I would certainly like to think about more. Its practical application could be significant. For example, how many points will apply to an applicant if he made his initial application in, say, January of a particular year, the application was taking several months or a year to process and the points system changed along the way? How many points would the person be regarded as having? Which hurdle would he have to jump?</PARA>
<PARA> The weighting to be given to the various components of the points system also requires very careful consideration. We are to have dual selection procedures and a differential points test depending on the category of migration. In that context there appears to have been downgrading of the value attached to a person's proficiency in English. I am not certain of that but it is something, again, which I would want to examine much more closely. If there has been a significant further downgrading-that would be difficult to do considering what the Government has done over recent years; it has slashed dramatically the English proficiency element-it is a very bad move. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an argument that, for the first time in our history, the Government, with its decision today, has created two classes of citizen. A migrant being sponsored by an Australian citizen will score a different number of points depending on whether the sponsor has been a citizen for less than five years or more than five years. A very important point of principle needs consideration. Have we not, in fact, created two classes of citizen? Why should an Australian citizen be considered differently if he has been a citizen for four years rather than six years?</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand the proposed points allocation system, if a person has been unemployed for less than one month he can receive 10 points, but if he has been unemployed for more than one month-for example, one month and a day-regardless of the reason of the unemployment, he gets no points at all. That is also a matter that requires further consideration. I do not profess to give a final judgment on it. These are all matters of significance that need to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to abolish the self-supporting retirees category is an important one. As elected members of Parliament, immigration cases come to us and we see some very worthwhile self-supporting retiree cases. It appears that that category will no longer exist. However, curiously, retirees will be able to come here on what is called a temporary stay, on an extended basis. What does that mean? How will it work out in practice? For example, what happens if a retiree gets sick while he is here? That is another matter that needs very careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that the Government, again, has been tardy beyond any reasonableness in terms of looking at overseas qualifications, which is a very important area. As Senator Puplick said today, there have been reports over many years-the report of the Fry Committee of Inquiry into the Recognition of Overseas Qualifications and others-and still the Government has not moved in that area. My guess is that one of the reasons the Government has been so tardy in moving on the recognition of overseas qualifications is the pressure that is being exerted on it by the trade union movement. That has been one of the major hassles in recent years and there seems to be no reason why that will change. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, the establishment of the Bureau of Immigration Research is perhaps a reasonable proposition, but it is a very expensive one. It will cost $4m a year and will employ a staff of 41, despite the fact that most of the research work that that Bureau will do will be commissioned out. There is every indication that there will be a duplication of the work of the Bureau by existing bodies. I think that the role of the Bureau needs to be spelled out much more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the whole question of the Minister's decision making powers needs to be considered further. My own view on that is that the Minister's statement goes along the right lines but, as I think was also pointed out by Senator Puplick and perhaps Senator Stone today, the Minister's retaining the general statutory power to override any decision of the revamped review panel system which, consistent with the regulations acts against the interests of the applicant, may well be a reasonable proposition. But it appears that the Minister would not have the power to reverse a decision by the review panel which had been in favour of the applicant if we, for good and valid reasons, wanted to refuse that person entry to Australia. Again, I believe that that is another matter that requires consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some aspects of the report that I welcome, for example, the continued commitment to our refugee and humanitarian program and the maintenance of the family reunion program, although again I think that the fine details there need careful examination. Those decisions are fully in line with the policies of the Liberal and National parties. Regrettably though, other key elements of the coalition's migration policy-elements which reflect very much the views of the FitzGerald report-have been rejected by the Government. For example, reading from the executive summary of the immigration and ethnic affairs policy of the Liberal and National parties we see that we, as a coalition, have committed ourselves to increase Australia's migration intake. The figures that we have in mind, although they cannot be determined too far in advance, would be much more in line with the recommendations and views in the FitzGerald report than with what the Government announced in its statement today. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we would `place greater emphasis on the recognition of skills and qualifications of settlers'. The Government has greatly downgraded the recommendations of the FitzGerald Committee in that regard. A related point in our policy is to `assess the individual's suitability as a migrant according to the contribution that person can make to the current and future needs of Australia'. Again, I believe that the Government has downgraded the importance of that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the recognition that the Minister has given in his statement to the key tenet of the coalition's immigration philosophy, namely, to use the Minister's words, `that immigration should be for all Australians', and that, `those born in Australia and those who migrate to Australia are equally accorded their rights'. Again, to quote the Minister, migrants should `bring a commitment to Australia and to its basic values and institutions which attracted them to migrate'. To give just one more quote from the Minister's statement, he speaks of `an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has used the term `multiculturalism' to describe these fundamental issues and commitments. Regrettably, not everyone shares that definition of the word. The FitzGerald report made that clear and so has the coalition. The coalition would go further, though, and say that this Government has pursued its concept of multiculturalism in a way that has not unified; rather, it has divided the nation. In essence, that is what this debate on so-called multiculturalism has been all about. Tonight is not the occasion to go into a debate on that. But the essence of that debate rests on the policies of this Government and the application of those policies, including, for example, the use of grants of money to buy the votes of different ethnic communities in a way that is divisive amongst those communities and within those communities. In my view that is a disgrace and one of the great blots on this Government's policy in the immigration area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely right, Senator Stone. In essence, the fine words of the Minister today amounted to a ringing endorsement of what the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) have been saying about the ideal of one Australia. It amazes me that the Government appears not to be able to see that what it is saying, as distinct from what it is doing, is absolutely in line with the philosophy of one Australia, as outlined by the official policy documents of the coalition and by Mr Howard. I quote from our policy:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The next Liberal National Party Government will foster the ideal of One Australia where loyalty to Australia, our institutions and our values transcends loyalty to any other sets of values anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> All the policies of the Liberal and National Parties are based upon respect for the value of each individual. We are totally committed to equal treatment and equal opportunity for all Australians regardless of race, colour, creed or country of origin within the framework of a just and tolerant society. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we are on about when we look at the future of our country. That is very much in line with what the Government seems to be saying. I urge the Government to look at the pursuit of its policies in a way that will accord with that, rather than continue with its present practice of following policies which have, in effect, the opposite result. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition is deeply disappointed with the Government's response to the FitzGerald report. The Government has walked away from the major recommendations of the report, which stated that Australia needs an immigration program based on skilled and investing migrants. As the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Mr Alan Cadman, said in a press release today:</PARA>
<PARA>The statement today by the Minister does not allay concern but increases the uncertainty for the Australian community and for sponsors and relatives trying to establish how the system will work. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say-and this is probably the most important point of all:</PARA>
<PARA>In-fighting within the Government produced a policy which is almost identical with the existing policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We all know the problems that the existing policy is causing. The Government has shown today that it lacks the commitment to solve the problems confronting it and Australia in this area. As a result Australia will be the poorer and both intending and existing migrants will continue to lack the confidence and certainty which they rightly deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to make only a few points in this debate. In my view, the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies is very substantial and has added to the store of knowledge for people concerned about immigration to this country. The Government response is very clear and lights the path for the immediate future in that regard. My understanding of the way in which we view immigration in this country-and, of course there are now many earlier migrants who are part of that group in this country which has a view on this matter-is that we share this country with others who are less fortunate than ourselves and that there are those who wish to come to Australia, be part of it and contribute to our society, of which we can all be justly proud. We welcome these people to our hearts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Listening to Senator Puplick, I was very concerned to hear him comment on what he saw as the contribution of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to escalating division between Australian nationals and migrants and increasing racial tension in this country. I remind him and other senators that the Prime Minister responded to the FitzGerald report in a way that comforted and gave a guarantee to people of all races in this country that they had a right to be here, that we could all live together peacefully and could all contribute to the future of this country for the sake of our children and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short said that business migration had not been affected by the so-called debate about restricting the level of Asian migration. I was interested to hear him refer to someone in Hong Kong who is making a lot of money by recommending certain business migrants. I agreed wholeheartedly with this recommendation in the FitzGerald report:</PARA>
<PARA>That for business immigrants the grant of Australian citizenship be contingent on provision of proof of a business venture having been set up. </PARA>
<PARA>My view is that enough people in this country exploit workers without our inviting people with even more expertise in this area to do so. However, I am not suggesting that we should not have any business migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I visited South East Asia as a member of a parliamentary delegation comprising politicians from different political parties. I felt very keenly the resentment of people in those countries to the sort of comments made by John Stone and John Howard on behalf of the Opposition, which denigrate the position of Asians and their right to migrate to this country. Indeed, that question was raised by a number of Filipino senators, including the Vice-President. My response was that the Prime Minister has said very clearly in a public statement that never again should any person be judged, for immigration purposes, by the colour of his skin or his country of origin. Afterwards, in private discussions, several of those people thanked me for making that statement. I suggested that Bob Hawke's stature in those countries and in this country is high, compared to that of the Liberal Party and its leader. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot of talk about skilled migrants. The response tabled by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) stated:</PARA>
<PARA>These economic migrants, through the skills, capital and expertise they bring, actually create more jobs than they take and make a very positive contribution to our economic development. </PARA>
<PARA>The fifth page of the original text of the response refers to a figure of 71,000 in the family category and 54,000 in the economic category. My experience, which is based on discussions with people, not on research published in books, is that while many migrants are skilled, there has been a lot of training of Australian workers. How many of those people are using those skills today? The figure, at best, is probably 66 per cent. There is no shortage of skilled people in this country, but skilled people are not prepared to work in those skilled positions because of the lousy pay, based on the suppression of wages over many years by Liberal-National Party governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It used to be said that we needed skilled migrants because we could not train our workers quickly enough. That was being said in 1950, in 1955 and in 1960. It has been said for years and years that we need skilled migrants, but what have we done about training our workers in this country? What have we done to provide the necessary level of reward for those people so that they stay in their jobs? I assure the Senate that not very much has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times some obstacles have been removed. Employers and trade unions are now looking at ways in which people can have a career path. No longer does a young person have to serve an apprenticeship or be a trainee. No longer does a person miss out if he does not undertake such training. Now we are looking at situations where all sorts skilled and unskilled people can be trained to obtain higher skills. What we need to do is to train the people who are already in this country. Many of those people are migrants and the sons and daughters of migrants. That is why the decision to allow a larger intake in respect of family reunions is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe some of those people who do not have the skills we need will be trained and become skilled in this country. That is why I believe that the response of the Minister is correct. We need to go down that path and train the people we have here. After all, we still have hundreds of thousands of unemployed people even though this Government has provided more than a million jobs. This is something that the previous Liberal-National Party Government could not do. In fact, prior to its dismissal from office it was responsible for the loss of some 200,000 jobs. What we need to do is train people in this country to undertake jobs and make our society even richer and better than it is now. People are welcome to come here and make a contribution. They will enrich this society in a way that people who enter this country only because they have skills will not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concern which has been expressed about families by both Government and Opposition senators and, specifically, by Senator Puplick, would ring rather more true if yesterday, when the Australian Democrats had sought to remove the taxes on soya milk and computers for handicapped children, the Government and Opposition had voted not to retain those taxes. If they had seen that these were genuine attempts to improve the lot of families who were in some difficulty, we would take their crocodile tears over the family rather more seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made the point before that one of the reasons that the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies and what has flowed from it fails and will continue to fail, is that before one can properly decide on an immigration policy one has to decide on a population policy. A population policy is fundamental to a country. Once one has determined a population policy, one then determines to what extent one wants that population filled by one's own people by natural procreative activity and to what extent one wants it filled by immigration. Australia has developed no population policy whatsoever and it is about time that it did. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I was elected to this place and the inquiry into immigration was first mooted, I wrote to both the Minister responsible for immigration and the Minister responsible for the environment, pointing out that it was fundamental to a consideration of the immigration question that population be a matter for consideration and that a proper person to consider the relationship between a population and its environment-and that is what we are talking about in the long term in Australia-would be a biologist. I suggested that a biologist, a person who knows about the relationship between populations and the environment, should be a member of that Committee. I also suggested that a demographer should be on that Committee. I would have thought that it was absolutely essential that a demographer be on a committee that was looking at immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did I get a negative response from both of those Ministers, but they said that it was not necessary to have such people on that Committee. A point that I have made in other debates in relation to science education and funding in this country is appropriate in this instance-that is, that this Government is so ignorant on these matters that it does not know when it requires help and where to get it. In respect of the biological inadequacy of the FitzGerald report, point 9 (iii) in the matrix presented to us today states:</PARA>
<PARA>Immigration policies will be determined by Australia's national interests . . . and strategies for Australia's social, economic and cultural development. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of the relationship between the population and the ability of the Australian environment to support that population. A Mr Chris Watson, who comes from the city and is very concerned about these matters of population, wrote to Dr Theophanous drawing to his attention the excellent recent publication How Many Australians?. This is a source book containing a number of essays which deal with the relationship between a population and the ability of the environment to continue supporting that population in the long run. Dr Theophanous wrote back to Mr Chris Watson pointing out what he thought of this book. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I consider that work to be entirely erroneous and in some cases missing the whole point of what is possible in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He totally rejected consideration of those matters. He used the smear tactic which has been used so often when one has attempted to raise this debate. In his final paragraph Dr Theophanous said:</PARA>
<PARA> While I am sure that you put forward your arguments in good faith, you should be aware that these kinds of arguments are being misused by people whose motives in opposition to immigration, are extremely dubious. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly true. There are people who are using these arguments for dubious purposes but that should not be a reason why these matters of population and the ability of the country to maintain a population in the long run should not be raised. For the edification of Dr Theophanous and the edification of other senators in relation to what the population in this country has done to this country in 200 short years, I point out that 19 vertebrate species are extinct; 74 other vertebrate species are endangered; 10 per cent of the plants of this whole continent are endangered-that is, 2,200 species-and 78 species of plants have become extinct. We have lost half of the topsoil of this country, two-thirds of our temperate forest has gone, and a study on land degradation which has been referred to repeatedly in this place shows that over 60 per cent of the land area in Australia is in need of some restorative work at a cost in 1984 dollars of $1.6 billion. Yet we can find only $122m per year to spend on that work. It is quite clear that the population that we already have in this country, given the way it is using the environment, is seriously degrading the ability of that environment to go on supporting that population in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people are bemused-`bemused' is the appropriate word-when they look at a map of Australia and say that it is a large country. Only about 10 per cent of the Australian landscape is arable land. That is the land in which people want to live; the land in which we support people by growing crops and producing food. Australia is quite a small country when one looks at its resource base. As I have already indicated, we have seriously depleted that resource base already. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that the Democrats would support a much reduced immigration policy, and I want to develop that line. Having said that, I want to make it quite clear-I was apparently misunderstood by Senator Harradine when I developed these arguments earlier-that the selection of migrants who come to this country would be, in our policy, on a totally non-racist and non-ethnic basis. There would be no selection on criteria of race or ethnic origin. In relation to race I point out that the cover of the booklet tabled today entitled Information: The Department of Immigration has at the top right hand corner the phrase `200 years of immigration'. I would simply like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the immigration policy in this country is a continuation of the process of disruption and dispossession of the Aboriginal people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Several weeks ago I asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) whether the Aboriginal people of Australia had ever been asked whether they supported an immigration policy for Australia. The answer was, `Well, the Aboriginal people could have come to the FitzGerald inquiry and given evidence'. Anybody who knows anything about Aboriginal people knows that it is extremely difficult for them to do that. Those Aboriginal people I have asked about our immigration policy have made it quite clear that they do not support an immigration policy in Australia. They see migrants coming in as being a very advantaged group with respect to what they get in support. If one looks through the program which is outlined before us, one sees that extra help is given in skill training, extra help is given with the English language and so on and so forth. Bearing in mind that in this country we have some of the most disadvantaged people in the world, namely our own Aboriginal people, it is help we should be directing more properly towards those people who occupied this country for some 40,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In that connection I was interested to pick up the Brisbane Courier-Mail today. The heading on the front page reads, `Cook may have made a right royal mistake, says Judge'. Mr Denis Walker, before a court in Brisbane, pleaded that Cook overstepped the charter given to him by King George III in taking possession of the continent without the consent of the Aboriginal people. As we all know, the assumption on which this country has operated for the last 200 years is one of terra nullius; that is, the country was unoccupied. I guess on that basis we can continue to bring in migrants. But I suggest that if the Government is at all serious about recognising Aboriginal land rights-it was the first motion it put through in the Senate when we moved into this new chamber and recognised prior Aboriginal occupation and ownership of Australia and dispossession without compensation-logically it follows that if we are to have an immigration program at all, we should be going to the Aboriginal people and asking them whether they want more people to come in and further dispossess them of further land and advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is generally recognised by the community that although Australia's natural rate of reproduction has fallen below one-that is, below replacement; for a family that rate is 1.87 which is a little bit less than two-the population rate will not fall. There is a long lag built into population shifts. Without any immigration whatsoever the population of this country will go on increasing, and will increase by about another 3.1 million by the year 2,030. If the net reproduction rate continued to be below replacement then it would go into slow decline but would not fall back to 16 million people until about 100 years from now. So the claim that we need immigration to occupy this land is simply without foundation. That is something that any demographer could have told FitzGerald or anybody else who is commenting on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which has often been asserted-I think it was mentioned this afternoon or in this evening's debate-is that migrants somehow help the ageing of the population. The dependency rate has shifted by only about two percentage points because of immigration. I noticed that Senator Baume mentioned the importation of skills. I find it remarkable that we have had an immigration program since 1947 and some people can still claim that we need to bring in more people because we lack skills. That is a very serious indictment of the educational process of this country. It is a serious indictment of those industries, which are supported by members of the Opposition, which have failed to train adequately the people needed in those industries. If the best argument we can bring for an immigration program is that we need more skills, people should be getting off their backsides and ensuring that we have a much better education and training program. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of immigration in this country has been one in which we have brought people in not for their benefit but ours. One has only to go back to those early years, from 1947 through the 1950s, to remember the `populate or perish' argument and the threat of the yellow hordes coming down to take over this country. We did not bring people into this country for their benefit; we brought people in because we thought we needed numbers for the defence of the country. We also wanted people to be labourers. I remember people who later on became my university colleagues and who came out with medical degrees who were working as fettlers on the transcontinental railway line. Women with science degrees were washing factory floors. So let us not kid ourselves that we have a good record with respect to benefiting migrants; we do not have a very good record at all. We should be doing more to help those migrants who have come into the country. The emphasis should be on helping them rather than on the way in which they can help us. That also comes out of a smaller, more humanitarian targeted program. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that has to be said is that 80 per cent of the population increase in Australia since the early years of migration has accrued to capital cities. That includes both the natural increase and the increase brought about by migration. During that time the population in all the capital cities has at least doubled. Some have gone up by 2 1/2 times. The projected rate of population growth dependent upon the immigration targets which are mentioned in the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies and in the statement that is before us-there is not much difference between the figures; only about 10,000-would see all Australian cities double in size again by some time in the 2020s. Several people have remarked that surveys of the Australian population indicate that the majority of Australians are either opposed totally to a migration program or are opposed to an increased migration program and favour a much smaller program. I think their perceptions are correct. They see cities becoming larger, more inhuman, more polluted, and dirtier. They see people having to travel further to work and having to spend more on houses because population pressure impacts on the cost of housing. Their perception is that the migration program is making them worse off. I think that perception is real. Unless this Federal Government does something to help the States address the problem of infrastructure costs, the quality of life in our cities will simply deteriorate. That is quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Government, in its submission to the FitzGerald inquiry, said that in the five years between 1985 and 1990 the maintenance of infrastructure in Adelaide would cost $800m. In the five years, 1995 to 2000, only 10 years further on, it said that the infrastructure costs will be $3 billion. That will be the total amount of money needed for the maintenance of infrastructure in Adelaide-leaving no money whatsoever for the expansion of infrastructure which will be required if we continue to pursue population increase as a policy. It follows, quite clearly, that the quality of life in our cities will deteriorate if we continue down this road. </PARA>
<PARA> To simply take some vague economic target and say that that is going to be achieved by more people coming in is simply a falsity. There is no evidence whatsoever that migration has improved the economic lot of Australia. There are a number of countries with both small and large populations, but with relatively stable populations that have done economically much better than Australia. That is not to deny that the cultural life of Australia has been enriched, but that is a different argument. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to refugees, the Democrats believe that they should be dealt with as a separate category, which is not included in the immigration program. Refugees are not necessarily immigrants. They are very often people who are seeking asylum from political and other persecution. Some of them may eventually settle; some may want temporary asylum and then want to go back to their own country. The Democrats believe, as Senator Jenkins said earlier, that Australia could substantially increase its refugees intake bearing that in mind. The Democrats believe that that should be done for humanitarian reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the business migration program, one need only reflect on the fact that those with half a million dollars who are leaving their own country have no great commitment to the country in which they made that half a million dollars. To those who say that if our business migration program is not freed up those people will go to Canada, South America, Germany or somewhere else, I simply say that if their commitment to Australia is so strong that they will simply take their money somewhere else, are they the sort of people one wants in this country? I am reminded of a program I saw several years ago on Argentina, which had attracted a large number of immigrants from Europe in the 1920s. Those people had settled; they had never become Argentineans; they still regarded themselves as Germans, Italians or whatever; they were third generation people, still intending to go back and still repatriating money back. One need only look at the economic plight of Argentina and reflect on whether in the long run those people have been beneficial to the country. </PARA>

In recent weeks a plan has been put forward by the Minister for Water Resources in Western Australia that a pipeline be built from the Ord Dam in the extreme north-east corner of Western Australia all the way down to Adelaide and Perth to maintain a growing population. The figures that have been mooted for that pipeline are $8 billion capital cost. One need only do back of envelope calculations on the interest and amortisation of $8 billion to work out that it would cost some $4,000 per family per year simply to maintain the pipeline before any water was even pumped through it to realise how ridiculous that is. Yet that is the sort of scheme that is being looked at due to the fact that the population is being pushed up against a limited resource base. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As a member of that Committee who wrote a dissenting report, it is worth my going through some of the evidence given and the reasons for that dissenting report. The report is entitled The Adequacy of International Terminal and Aircraft Handling Facilities at Sydney Airport. It is important to realise that the reason for the reference was the known congestion at Sydney which was forecast to become much worse. That is the reason the Standing Committee took on this reference. Anyone who goes through that airport, as I do twice a week, will know that it is unusual to get a straight run into Sydney. Those of us who come from the north have a very clear knowledge of the area around the Hunter Valley because that is where we circle for up to half an hour simply coming into Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact of life that Sydney is the gateway to Australia; the majority of tourists wish to enter or exit through Sydney. People from other States may question why tourists want to do that, but it is a fact. To a tourist Sydney is to Australia what we perceive London to be to the United Kingdom, Rome to Italy or Paris to France. Hence the vast majority of tourists at some time or another want to go through Sydney. To add to the congestion, Sydney is the domestic hub for air traffic around Australia. Therefore, congestion at Sydney is not only a big threat to the growth of tourism but can and does seriously dislocate domestic airlines all around Australia. In fact, the hold-ups that occur fairly regularly at Sydney between 6 and 8 a.m. have a ripple effect on every schedule right around the country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is much worse on a wet day, but I am talking about normal congestion even in good times. Someone said to me the other day, `I cannot believe it. I got on a plane at Cairns and I was told that the reason we were delayed was congestion at Sydney Airport'. The pilot told all the passengers, as pilots do interminably, whether we are coming into Sydney or leaving Sydney, that the congestion at Sydney Airport was causing lots of problems. The delay at Cairns was caused by the early congestion in Sydney in the peak period between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. There are two major problems. One is the lack of runway capacity, which adversely affects both international and domestic flights. The second problem is that the international terminal itself has had a major effect on the international flights and, hence, tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> International passenger movements between 1977 and 1987-just 10 years-have increased, including the transit passengers, from 2.3 million to 4.4 million people, just through the international terminal. It is estimated by various authorities that by 1995 the number of international passenger movements through Sydney will be between 6 million and 8 million-depending on the sort of forecast that has been made and who did it. It is generally conceded that those figures may be too low and that the figure may be between 7 million and 10 million. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, Sydney is also the hub for domestic flights and, because of the decentralised nature of New South Wales, is a major commuter centre. It currently has about 30,000 commuter movements in and out of Kingsford-Smith Airport--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twelve months. In fact, it is 30,000 `commuter movements'; not passengers. Everyone on the Committee, from the extensive evidence given, would agree with this summary which is documented in a more detailed fashion in the report. I do not intend to go into those details. We all know the problem. The question is: Which is the most sensible decision? Which is the most sensible solution? That is what our job should be. That is the reason for these standing committees; that is the reason we look at references. We are not supposed to go in there with preconceived ideas. We are supposed to go in, listen to the evidence, and make a reasoned judgment at the end, and not make a judgment which is based on some political decision. I make that point because I believe that the majority report is not based on the evidence. Submissions made were varied from one extreme to the other: from the total closure of Kingsford-Smith Airport to the immediate construction of Badgerys Creek. I wonder whether those people on the other side, including Minister Evans, before they decided to go ahead with this, discussed it with Senator Walsh. Did they ask Senator Walsh whether he would commit, in today's dollars, some $2 billion? No matter how we lag it, that is the sort of figure we are looking at if we start to move to Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the submissions made varied from one extreme to the other. One was the total closure of Kingsford-Smith Airport by members of a particular action group who had purchased their homes under a flight path. They were hoping that if Kingsford-Smith Airport were moved they would have some very valuable real estate. I can understand their thinking, but they did, after all, purchase under a flight path. Neither the Committee nor, I understand, this Government would contemplate the closure of Kingsford-Smith Airport. That is quite clear. In fact, from some of the evidence given, the Botany Council did not suggest the closure of Kingsford-Smith Airport. I make this very clear because the politics of it are such that there are some who would go around badgering local areas saying, `What we want to do is close Kingsford-Smith Airport and if you don't, we will use our political pull to make sure that you have difficulties in the next election, whether it be State or Federal'. But even the Botany Council said, `We have no intention of closing. We don't want you to close Kingsford-Smith Airport'. The reason it does not want it to be closed is that most people who live there either work in the airport or in some area associated with the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority recommendation in principle on the airport is reflected in paragraph 6.7 and paragraph 6.8. I will read these paragraphs out because they explain the reason the majority came to that conclusion. It had nothing to do with the evidence. Paragraph 6.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Honourable Gareth Evans, QC, on 19 August 1988, announced a commitment to proceed with a second airport for Sydney located at Badgerys Creek. In addition, the Public Works Committee also recommended extensive improvements to Sydney Airport totalling $214m in cost be undertaken. These initiatives prompt the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>I am talking about the majority of the Committee, who were all Labor senators-</PARA>
<PARA>to conclude that a decision to have concurrently built an additional runway would have been premature and not cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA>Having said that, the next paragraph, paragraph 6.8, states-and how woolly can one get?:</PARA>
<PARA>However in reaching that conclusion it is not the Committee's intention to dismiss the additional runway option for all time. It may well be that after the planned arrangements and developments at Sydney Airport are in place and the airport at Badgerys Creek is operational, air traffic could reach such levels that it will be necessary to again assess the need for an additional runway at Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is the reason for our dissenting report. In this case, the majority has put the cart in front of the horse. It makes sense to everyone, on the evidence given to us, that step one is to start looking at the construction of a third runway parallel with the existing runway into Botany Bay. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. We believe that the cost of construction of Badgerys Creek, bearing in mind all the infrastructure associated with it, whether it be freeways, fast trains or whatever, would have to be in excess of $2 billion in today's dollar terms. To then state that it is not the Committee's intention to dismiss the additional runway is, as I said earlier, putting the cart before the horse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sydney Airport is in crisis. Already delays are directly costing the airlines, and thus the passengers, a figure estimated to be in excess of $20m a year. I believe that that is a conservative figure. The figure given to us by Australian Airlines alone in direct costs-fuel being used while planes circle in patterns waiting to land and so on-was about $8.5m. So a conservative estimate would be about $20m a year. The indirect cost in delays and missed connecting flights is anybody's guess. This is a serious matter and a serious decision has to be made by this Government. It is time to stop playing politics and start playing government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our conclusions are, firstly, that notwithstanding improvements to the international terminal, an additional new terminal will be required. The user airline indicated in evidence its interest in building and operating such a new terminal. It should be given the opportunity to do so. Secondly, a third medium-spaced 2,000 metre runway should be constructed, located approximately 1.050 metres east of the main north-south runway into Botany Bay. This would take aircraft of up to Boeing 737 size and is estimated to increase Sydney's traffic handling capacity by 40 per cent. It would be expected to take all the commuter and general aviation aircraft. It should also be borne in mind that it would reduce the environmental effects on the people in the area. That has been forgotten. A third runway would halve the noise problems of people living in the area because, in the main, aircraft would take off and land over Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that this third runway must be started, and it must be started immediately. Time should be the essence of the contract. Figures have been given which I disagree with, on the basis of my experience in construction. I do not believe in the time factor. I would be absolutely surprised if a third runway parallel to the existing one into Botany Bay could not be completed in two years. In regard to planning, I suppose that consideration of Badgerys Creek as a site for a second airport should continue. However, one should always bear in mind that the forecasts which we are making today, which I believe are conservative, are only forecasts and that things change; technology changes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth drawing honourable senators' attention to an advertisement placed in last Saturday's Australian by a group of people calling themselves the KSA Task Force. I do not know them; I have had no contact with them. The headline of their full page advertisement read, in part, `You won't mind paying $120 for a taxi'. If the Government decides to go ahead at Badgerys Creek without taking the option of immediately building a third runway at the existing airport, that is what people will be paying. Experts in this field had no hesitation in telling the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in private discussions that to go ahead at this stage with Badgerys Creek would be a disaster. Their reason was that until there is a full-blown airport and internationals can be hooked up with domestics and commuters, there will be absolute chaos. A person flying from Brisbane to Sydney or from Melbourne to Sydney to hook up with an international flight would end up paying $150 to get from Kingsford-Smith to the international airport or vice versa. An article entitled `Abusive Pilots ``Risk to Safety'' ' on the front page of yesterday's Sydney Daily Telegraph supports the evidence which the Committee received and the conclusions it has come to. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The frustrated pilots often have to circle Sydney for more than an hour waiting for permission to land. </PARA>
<PARA>Sydney is the gateway to Australia. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> With congestion at Sydney Airport getting worse, aviation authorities fear flight controllers could crack under the strain. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. Pilots get frustrated, abuse the air traffic controllers and try to jump their slot in the queue. That sort of thing is inevitable. It is my sincere belief that, if all members of the Committee had based their final recommendation on the evidence given, every single one would have supported the minority report. Unfortunately, politics are involved. Labor senators were concerned that if they came down with such a report it would somehow affect their chances in the next election, either Federal or State. I can accept that in a democracy those sorts of things must be taken on board but, frankly, I could not see the political backlash because everyone would be in agreement with it. Decisions have to be made. As I said earlier, it is about time, on such an important decision, that this Government started to play at government rather than at politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I must do in speaking to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled The Adequacy of International Terminal and Aircraft Handling Facilities at Sydney Airport is to stress the present state of affairs at that airport. There are huge inefficiencies there and they are important not solely to Sydney, and least of all to New South Wales; they are of national importance. As Senator Parer said, the cost of this has not been measured but it is probably well in excess of $20m a year. A point to make about that is that this matter has not arisen in the last 12 months or two years: the cost of the airport to the Australian economy has been building up year after year for at least a decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point to make is that the majority report is a very poor report. It is one of the worst Senate reports I have ever seen. It is lightweight and inconsequential. The report of the minority is a good report. It adopts a commonsense approach to the problem, but it suffers from the general deficiencies that went into the main report. The main report is just a hand-wringing exercise. On every page the report acknowledges the problem, but it is devoid of any analysis in depth as to how the problem arose. It is quite devoid of any creative thought as to how it should be addressed and there are almost no conclusions or recommendations in the majority report. It does recommend that a monitoring system be put in place so that we know how bad things are-that in itself will not solve the problem. It does recommend proceeding with the terminal, and that is already in train. And it does comes down quite strongly in favour of the new airport. While Sydney must have another primary airport, a new airport is the lesser priority at present. As Senator Parer said, it is back to front. Basically, the majority of members on that Committee did not grasp the nettle. My argument is that the problem has to be attacked; we cannot pretend that it does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the causes of the problem? The problem is in two forms: first of all, there are considerable and significant delays to aircraft using Sydney Airport; and, secondly, the international terminal lacks space and capacity for the crowds that are going through it. The consequences of these are also twofold: firstly, there is the economic cost; and, secondly, there is the emotional cost. We are trying to build up a tourist industry in this country. Apart from international tourists we have a great number of Australian travellers going through Sydney. The emotional trauma of the delays of the international and other traffic coming through the terminal is a very bad advertisement for Australia. Those delays in themselves have an economic cost.</PARA>
<PARA> Most members of this Parliament fly through Sydney twice a week and we know very well what problems are being experienced. For years now, coming down from Brisbane on the first flight in the morning, there has been a standard 20-minute hold at the back of Newcastle before entry into Sydney Airport. Two weeks ago when I was coming down the delay was in excess of one hour. It is almost unbelievable. We were actually longer in the holding pattern than it took us on block time from Brisbane to Sydney. That sort of nonsense simply cannot be tolerated because it is costing the person who buys the ticket a fortune. It means that those aircraft holding for 20 minutes or an hour on entry are burning a lot more fuel than they should burn on the sector. There is the dead time on the air frame and the engines because those components are lifed and their period in service is on a number of flying hours; there is dead time just holding in a pattern; and there is the dead time of the crew just holding in the orbit. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimate that Australian Airlines gave this Committee was that it was costing it $8.5m a year, and I believe that to be a conservative estimate. I believe that the same figure would be borne by Ansett Airlines of Australia. With secondary costs arising from this, a figure of $20m to $30m a year is not an unreal estimate of what it is costing Australian travellers. I emphasise that that $20m or $30m is a straight transfer to the cost of an airline ticket in Australia. It is not transferred to the Government; it is not transferred to anyone else; it must be a cost borne by the airlines and, as they must make a profit, that cost is transferred on to the travellers. That is only one reason air fares in Australia are so high. </PARA>
<PARA> The bad feature of this is that Sydney happens to be the main entry point for overseas traffic into Australia. For internal traffic-there is really no logic for this-nearly all Australian domestic services hub through Sydney; in other words, nearly all the trunk routes land and take off from Sydney. Whether one is going from Perth to Cairns or from Brisbane to Adelaide the services go through Sydney. There are very few direct flights. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the causes of these delays? First of all, the runway system is inadequate. We simply do not have enough runways. There must be a third minor runway to take the commuter traffic and the smaller, regular public transport aircraft. The point that is not appreciated by the protesters around Sydney Airport is that, by putting in a third runway to take the lighter traffic, this will not mean an increase in the traffic per day. It will mean that there is more traffic coming in per hour, but the number of movements per day, and therefore the amount of noise generated, will not be any greater. In fact it may well be that the noise intensity will be dispersed in so far as the approach and departure paths for the third runway will be a different pattern from those of the runways presently in use. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to look at the air traffic control procedures at Sydney airport. This report gives a maximum movement figure for Sydney airport of 54 movements per hour. That means that there is more one minute separation of traffic arriving and departing. That is a very generous standard, as I am sure Senator Sanders will agree, having been an air traffic controller. In good weather it is quite possible to close up those standards, bearing in mind that there are two runways that can be used, and still maintain safety. A couple of weekends ago I was talking to a friend of mine from New South Wales who had been flying in the United States a few months back. He was flying a Cessna 140, a very old and slow aeroplane, into Sacramento Airport. Sacramento is the capital of California and its airport is quite large. I have flown into that airport and I would say it is probably comparable with Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in terms of the traffic going through it. The control tower told my friend that he had three miles to run, which meant that he was three miles from the threshold on his approach and that he was number 13 to land. I emphasise that he was number 13 with three miles to run. In Australia there would be no one ahead of him if he had three miles to run to the threshold. I believe that the air traffic control procedures that we operate at Sydney airport are, in most cases, too generous and that they could be closed up without compromising safety in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, an improvement might be needed in radar and navigational aids at Sydney Airport. One of the great disabilities from which Sydney suffers is the maintainability of instrument landing systems (ILS) in bad weather. I came through Sydney earlier this year and I think that only one ILS was working. That puts an enormous brake on traffic. There is no excuse for that. The maintenance of the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was at that time, was not good enough to maintain all the navigation aids in an operable state. We cannot tolerate that sort of thing. Sydney is a first class airport and the air traffic control procedures must be good enough to maintain full serviceability, whatever the weather. </PARA>
<PARA> A short while ago Senator Hamer asked what should be done about all those small aeroplanes-the single-engined aircraft and the commuters-using Sydney Airport. One of the things we could do is to follow the American pattern and hold those aircraft over the field. That is the safest place in the air traffic pattern because almost no-one overflies an airport such as Sydney (Kingsford-Smith). Aircraft are either landing or taking off and if light twin-engined aircraft and single-engined aircraft were held in a stack directly over the field in good weather-and this could be done with perfect safety-it would be preferable to bringing them in from a stack 30 miles out when they would have to come in at low speed and fit in with high speed jet traffic. This means that separation has need to be very much greater. If the simple exercise were taken of holding those aircraft directly overhead, they could be slotted in when breaks arose in the heavier traffic, provided wake turbulence was not a problem at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that a major onslaught needs to be made on scheduling at Sydney Airport. International traffic should be moved away from its heavy dependence on Sydney as an entry point to Australia. Indeed, it is not at all logical for traffic coming from the north Pacific, the United States, Asia and Europe. The obvious point of entry is Perth in the west and Brisbane on the east coast. In Brisbane we have an excellent air field which, in many ways, is better than Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) and an increasing number of tourists want to go to places such as the Great Barrier Reef, north Queensland and Ayers Rock. Positive efforts should be made to encourage the asset which the Australian taxpayers have created in the form of the new Brisbane Airport and to use that as a point of entry. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that should be done is to reschedule an increasing number of direct flights between Brisbane and Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane, and from Perth to other centres, so that every flight is not automatically directed through Sydney. The second thing that needs to be done, apart from rescheduling, is to provide a third runway, and do so expeditiously. There is no reason why that could not be finished in about 18 months or two years. The third thing we need to do is to attend to those air traffic control problems, and increase the flow rate through the airfield. That is possible, given a bit of intelligent planning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Sanders said, it might be quite beyond the Civil Aviation Authority to do some intelligent planning. The final thing we ought to do is to plan for an alternative airport for Sydney. Probably, `alternative' is the wrong word. We need a supplementary primary airport. I do not know the area terribly well, but I do not see why Hoxton Park could not be developed as the alternative airport site. It seems to me that the planners, the bureaucracy, always want to develop virgin fields which have no houses. The fact is that it costs a great deal of money to build a major airport. If one has to spend a few more tens of millions of dollars in buying some houses in an area-provided that they are not houses like those in Bellevue Hill and Double Bay in Sydney-that is a cost that one must consider paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am told that the taxi fare at present to Badgerys Creek is about $120. Probably, by the time the airport is built, if it goes ahead in 10 to 15 years time, the fare would be $300 or $400. It is quite impractical for an airport to be so far out of town. It should be closer to the city. It is a matter of utility. Human beings use these facilities. They will not spend an hour in a plane, travelling from Melbourne or Brisbane to Sydney, and then two or three hours in a car, trying to get into the city. I am very much in favour of looking at an alternative site to Badgerys Creek. The Government should be prepared to pay money to resume houses and, having resumed those houses, it should place a corridor around the area and limit development purely to industrial development, so that there is not a repeat of the situation at Tullamarine in Melbourne. Residential accommodation is that suburb has been built close to the airport. It is creating a problem in an area which formerly consisted of green fields. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The all-too-obvious unwillingness of the Hawke Labor Government to tackle the capacity crisis and its associated problems at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport indicates quite clearly, even to the most casual observer, that this Government is utterly out of touch with the operations of the country's aviation industry. One of the more debilitating features of this Government's modus operandi in recent times has been its total lack of enthusiasm actually to make a decision about the disgraceful situation currently being experienced at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Kingsford-Smith Airport is a jumbled mess that currently masquerades as this country's premier international airport. People queue from the moment they arrive. Some even unluckier passenger queue before they arrive; it is known as a holding pattern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has now been tabled, along with the minority report by Senator Parer, Senator Boswell and me. The majority report simply reflects the unwillingness of the Australian Labor Party to take the required action. It mirrors the report of the joint Commonwealth-New South Wales Government task force released some weeks ago which, despite the strong support from the New South Wales Government for a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, prefers the option of the development of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek. This is Labor's idea of Future Directions-100 kilometres west of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> These reports demonstrate that the Labor Party has false priorities. The construction of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport should be an urgent priority. That is the conclusion of our minority report. It is based firmly on the evidence presented to the Committee and contained in the majority report. It is an urgent priority. But what is an urgent priority to this Government? It means no action and no decision. Instead, the Government ignores the advice of its own experts in both the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. The majority report of the Government members of the Committee ignores the weight of evidence we received. </PARA>
<PARA> How much longer can the Hawke Labor Government sit on the fence and ponder its collective navel while the air transport and tourism industries languish in a curry of chaos? The only logical option is to optimise Sydney Airport now, not in 15 years-the time we are told it will take to complete an airport at Badgerys Creek-but now, in Sydney at Kingsford-Smith Airport, where almost three-quarters of domestic flights are late, where Qantas Airways Ltd admits that nine-tenths of its flights are late due to an environment of controlled chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> By building a third runway, which could probably be built for $250m in three years-I notice that my colleague Senator Parer believes it could be built more cheaply and speedily than that-40 per cent would be added to the airport's current capacity. This move would significantly reduce delays which are now so common and so pronounced. It is a great shame that the future development of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, the hub of Australia's airline network, will suffer because yet again the Hawke Labor Government gives its management of the political agenda much greater priority than the real needs of Australians. Politics, we have found, comes before sound economic management. Now politics comes before a more efficient air transport system. There will be no runway. So much for this Government's oft boasted claim that it is prepared to take the hard unpopular decisions in the nation's interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing Australia's premier gateway being constrained by the desire of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) to keep his seat, which just happens to encroach on the environs of Sydney Airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume would know that area very well too. We all know that Mr Punch has a marginal seat but he is sacrificing the future development of the airport and of Australia's transport and tourist industries so that he can remain a member of parliament. What sacrifice! What gall! If honourable senators ask me, the best way to eliminate offensive noise in Barton would be to eliminate Mr Punch. The electors of Barton will recognise that at the next election. They will reject Labor's shortsighted political expediency. Voters Australia-wide will reject this Government, which is more concerned about political expediency and holding seats than with the future of tourism and air transport in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue clearly demonstrates the gulf between the Labor Government and the coalition. On the one hand, we have the political expediency of the Labor Party desperately clinging to marginal seats. On the other hand, despite the obvious advantage to the coalition of winning those same marginal seats, the coalition takes a rational and principled stand. It is rational because it is based on overwhelming evidence. It is principled because it places the needs of the nation above political expediency. That is that stand which Senator Parer, Senator Boswell and I have taken in our minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government ruthlessly dismisses the evidence that a parallel runway should be constructed in a politically motivated decision. It is nothing more than that. It is well accepted throughout the industry that the major constraint on the growth of international and domestic tourism is our Australian transport system. As many of us surely know, Sydney Airport and its facilities are so congested that saturation point is rapidly being reached. A third runway is not a luxury. It is not a little something to sweeten the pot but an urgent necessity. The rejection of this by the majority report is completely without substance and reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Airline passengers, both domestic and international, among others have long paid the price for years of this Government's procrastination flowing from a supreme lack of political will. The current mess is damning evidence of incompetence and demonstrates a total lack of foresight and planning in the control of Australia's major airport. The domino theory is alive and well and living at Sydney Airport. Delays in Sydney are transmitted like a social disease right across the country. Like any social disease, the treatment can become expensive. Delays disrupt business life and operations. This in turn adds to costs. They inconvenience holiday-makers, who represent some 40 per cent of domestic travellers. Tourists are upset. It is a great job we do for our international guests too when we stick them in a holding pattern. It is a great way to see the country! It is a miserable way of greeting visitors after both this Government and numerous businesses spend millions of dollars in promoting this country and attracting tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> But it does not stop with the holding patterns. Once these visitors actually set foot in our overburdened international terminal, there are a lot more queues in store for them. This Government has an inexhaust- ible supply of such jollies up its sleeve for the unsuspecting international visitor. Airline passengers, both domestic and international, have carried the excess baggage of political ineptitude for far too long. The Government's fragmented approach demonstrates the confusion of having no realistic policy. The airport's operational capacity has not kept pace with the needs of a broad range of industry users. So many unrealistic and inappropriate solutions have been proposed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that the poor capabilities of Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport did not happen overnight. It has a history, like most things. The inadequacies relate to runway capacity and to the international passenger terminal. That terminal was opened 18 years ago. The newer wide-bodied aircraft, capable of carrying increased numbers of passengers, were introduced while it was nearing completion. It was almost obsolete by opening day. It was immediately unable to cope with the 747s which were bringing greater numbers of tourists to this country. In the last two years that congestion has reached critical proportions. Together with political buck-passing and an exponential growth in tourists to Australia, Sydney Airport is quite clearly, like this Hawke Labor Government-beyond coping. Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport handles 58 per cent of all visitors to Australia. Last year over 3 1/2 million passengers arrived or departed through the airport. It is the preferred entry point for the vast majority of our overseas visitors. Combined with its focus as the prime destination for overseas visitors to Australia, a worldwide leap in passenger movements and air transport has seen Sydney Airport struggle unsuccessfully in coping with this sudden upturn in tourist traffic. Whilst high speed taxiways and the changes made to curfew hours will assist in easing the congestion in Sydney, a third runway is undoubtedly the next step in improving its overall efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Between January and September this year worldwide airline traffic was 9 per cent higher than in 1987. The International Air Transport Association has forecast a further 5 to 6 per cent annual increase. In simple terms that means that airline traffic will double to 2 billion passenger journeys per year by the year 2000. That is only 11 years away. The Hawke Labor Government wants Australia to wait a further 15 years, from whenever it gets around to building a second airport. In the meantime, the buck never stops and the patching here and there gains momentum until Kingsford-Smith Airport is positively bursting at the seams with aircraft and passengers. To meet this colossal upsurge in tourists and passenger traffic, our national airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, is spending $5 billion to buy 28 aircraft and double the size of its current fleet. Nearly every international airline is doing the same. This year Boeing has orders for 500 jets worth over $25 billion, an absolute all-time high. Airlines around the world will need to expand their fleets by 58 per cent just to cope with this demand. That means that some 11,000 large jet transports will be flying about the skyways. </PARA>
<PARA> How will Australia's premier international airport-the gateway to Australia-cope if the majority report is accepted, reinforcing Government inaction? How will it cope not in 11 years but in just four years when in 1992 saturation point is reached? The situation has become ludicrous. It has long been evident that Sydney Airport is a major problem just waiting for a solution. International economic prosperity of recent years has generated more discretionary income for people overseas, including dollars for travel, while an overall decline in air fares has provided a further stimulus to ticket sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of substantial new airports planned across the globe is only five. That includes the proposed Badgerys Creek airport. A host of massive new airports on greenfield sites, which can be expanded as and when required, free from environmental restrictions, will not happen. It must be accepted that most airports, including Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will require continual improvement. Aircraft production lines are working flat out to meet constant demand for new planes. That is a fact and nothing will change it. What is the point in having a very expensive half-baked airport which cannot be used to its optimum because the Hawke Labor Government is having a relaxing time in the sun, pondering over what decision it might make? It is not the answer to Sydney's problems to build a second airport some time in the future, somewhere out in the countryside, while refusing to build another runway at Sydney Airport to alleviate worsening congestion while that other airport is being built. </PARA>
<PARA> Badgerys Creek is another of Labor's world firsts: it is the only airport in the world where one can get a meal and an in-flight movie on one's way to the airport. The fundamental problem has always been the procrastination of this Hawke Government and its inability to decide whether or not a second airport should be built and, if so, where to build it. Delays are costing the two domestic airlines upwards of $15m per year. How many millions must this Government throw away before it makes a decision on this airport? Seventy-seven aircraft arrive or land daily in Sydney. Almost three-quarters are regularly late. Almost one-third are late by more than 10 minutes. And still this Government cannot decide. It wants more time to sit and ponder the issue. Just how much time does it think it has? How much time does it think this country has to respond to an overburdening demand?</PARA>
<PARA> Ninety per cent of both major domestic airlines' aircraft pass through Sydney at least once a day. This being the case, can any honourable senators remember the last time the aircraft on which they were travelling arrived or departed from Sydney on time? Such congestion is frightening and diabolical. The Federal Government has contributed to this shameful situation by allowing airline services to expand at the airport, while rejecting extra capacity by refusing to allow another runway. For instance, this year there was a 20 per cent increase. Just where is this to be absorbed?</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention to sit by idly and watch the collapse of the airline system at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The airport's paralysis is wreaking havoc on airlines and, as well, damaging the reputation of our international carrier-Qantas Airways Ltd. The Government also seems content to cost itself and the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue. It is clear that neither airlines, passengers, nor businesses associated with the airport will ever experience modern, decent, efficient facilities at this airport under this Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume interjects, that it is very necessary. This runway should be commenced without delay, and time should be the essence of the contract. This runway could be up and running while the Federal Government is still haggling about where and when to build a second airport for Sydney. The most important justification for a parallel runway is the dramatic improvement it would provide in bad weather. It would also halve the number of noise affected residents. It is time for a sensible decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The minority report reflects the only decision worth making-that is, an immediate start on a parallel runway at Sydney Airport. It is this option which solves the problem in the shortest time span and with the least inconvenience to travellers, now and in the future. It is the decision which must be taken. The previous Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Evans, has already announced a commitment to proceed with a second airport for Sydney located at Badgerys Creek. He has said that the first stage for general aviation would be complete by 1993. A promise is about all this Government can offer. This should be a nice little revenue raiser for the Government. It could charge a $20 departure fee when one leaves Sydney and a $5 arrival tax when one finally gets to Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans stated in this place on 28 November that the Federal Airports Corporation will totally finance the $214m being spent on extensive improvements at Sydney's international terminal. He claims that these improvements will `meet Sydney's needs into the next decade'. I thought an airport's primary function was to operate efficiently and in the best manner possible, and to serve the needs of all its clients. Senator Evans must be unaware of this fact because the $214m being spent now at the international terminal and associated facilities, plus the yet to be built airport at Badgerys Creek, will not remove the great discomfort and delay for many years to come. All this because the Hawke Labor Government could not and would not do the job and make a decision. It could not and would not for years and years. Now that same Government is making Australians pay in comfort, time and financial cost, while its power brokers dither over essential decisions concerning this country's air transport future. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report of this Committee is an extremely disappointing document. It is the recommendations of the minority report which ought to be adopted, but it seems that that will have to await the election of a coalition government, which certainly is not very far away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the honourable senator's thanks, but it is the only commonsense solution. We have seen around the world programs to put major, primary airports in the green fields outside major metropolitan centres. I note that in Los Angeles an airport was proposed at Palmdale, which is some 90 miles outside Los Angeles, because of the congestion at Los Angeles International Airport. In fact, it would have been easier to put it there than it would be to put an airport at Badgerys Creek because the runways already existed at Palmdale, Lockheed having quite a facility there. However, it was not economically viable even though the runways were in. The transportation difficulties to and from the existing Los Angeles International Airport and the metropolitan centre were too great. So Los Angeles International was redeveloped instead. That airport now has five parallel runways and handles an immense amount of traffic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I heard an idea tonight which I had not really thought about. Senator MacGibbon came up with the proposition that perhaps Australia's major international airport should be at Brisbane. I think that makes infinite good sense. Brisbane has a wonderful terminal and it would make a good first destination point and a fine departure point. It would certainly relieve some of the congestion at Sydney. I think 11 per cent of the aircraft movements at Brisbane Airport are international. The report brings up some interesting points. I fully concur with the testimony of United Airlines. On page 25 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of witnesses commented on entry and exit documents. United Airlines, for example, felt that Customs formalities for outbound passengers ought to be replaced with `a system similar to the US approach that requires no paperwork from outbound residents and the surrender of the second segment, of the arrival card by departing foreigners to the airline agent'. Their contention was that the `validity of the current card' and the need for the information it requested was questionable. </PARA>
<PARA>As a relatively frequent traveller to the United States I note the efficiency of its system. It does work. It certainly relieves the sort of congestion which is experienced at Australian airports. I move on to air traffic control, which was touched upon by Senator MacGibbon, whose comments I fully concur with. On page 26 of the report Captain A. S. King, who represented the General Aviation Association, is quoted as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> We need new taxiways, runways, and above all we need a new approach, a new system of air traffic control thinking, because if we do build another runway there is no guarantee that under our present system they will utilise it. . . . We also need revised thinking from our air traffic control colleagues to use that resource to its fullest, as it would be used in any part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, the air traffic control system used-the spacings, the philosophy used in Australian airspace, not only at Kingsford-Smith-is completely incompatible with safe and efficient aircraft movement. The system simply would not work if--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-For some time now it has been evident that we face a very difficult if not impossible legislative program within the time that was originally established for the sittings. The Government has already extended the sittings by a week and has today indicated that it may seek to extend the sittings beyond next week. The reality is that the initial part of this session was, I believe, unusually slow for two reasons: firstly, there was a referendum campaign and that led to a great deal of debate on matters related to the referendums. Secondly, there was then a State election and, as is always the case in the Federal Parliament, the advent of a State election means that a little more time than is usual is taken up on general debate which has no direct relevance to this Parliament but which is of a broader political significance. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that since that time on five broadcast days the Opposition brought forward no matter of public importance. In a number of ways we have sought to accommodate the genuine difficulty which exists for the Government with respect to the legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am simply making the point that the Democrats brought forward several matters of public importance. I am not sure for what reason, but that is their right. If one examines the debating record over recent times one finds that the minority in the Senate have had certainly more than their share of debating time. They have taken advantage of the Standing Orders. That is their right. I am pleased that the Minister has not sought to make a point of the debate this week. If one examines the media one finds widespread comment that the situation of Minister Hand is one where he should have resigned. That is not the view being put forward by the Opposition. The view we are putting forward is the view which has been widely supported in the community and among those who comment on politics. The Opposition makes absolutely no apology for the time which has been spent in dealing with that matter. Our only regret is that it has not been spent fruitfully in terms of achieving what we believe to be the proper constitutional outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At lunchtime today a number of Opposition speakers took themselves off the list of speakers for the matter of public interest discussion. Senator Colston, as is his right, chose to speak. Senator McLean, as is his right, chose to speak. But that ate into the time that the Opposition sought to make available for the conduct of Government Business. </PARA>
<PARA> A quite unreasonable regime of sittings is being imposed upon the Senate. The Opposition has already opposed the negativing of the adjournment on the basis that the sitting program makes it unreasonable that we should sit very late as well as sitting these lengthy and additional hours. I hope that the Government will see the folly of pursuing the course the Minister gave notice of today. I do not think that is worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has chosen to say that the Senate should not come back until 28 February. That is a very late start. It is the latest start I have known in the time that I have been in this Parliament, which will be 15 years next year. The Government has chosen to have an extraordinarily uneven pattern of sittings this year. It is within the Government's province to sit in an orderly way for a longer period of the year. That, I believe, is the appropriate response to the legislative log jam which has developed. I say to the Minister that the imposition of lengthy periods of extended sittings and late night sittings is not in the interests of the Parliament and is certainly not in the interests of the orderly consideration of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has always cooperated with the Government in terms of sitting when the Government requires, but I give the Government notice that we do not believe that the sort of extended sittings which are now proposed are in the interests of the Parliament or in the interests of the community. We might, therefore, choose to resist the additional sittings promoted by the Government in the notice of motion given today. I do not think the Senate wants to hear any more of me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rubberneck over there interjects. I hope that all assembled members, including Senator Walters, will listen with great attention to my speech on the report on Sydney Airport. Before the division was called I was pointing out that the air traffic control system in Australia is simply not adequate for a modern country. Certainly, it would not work in any country which has high aircraft densities. It only works here at all because we do not have a lot of aeroplanes in our airspace. As anyone who flies on commercial airlines knows, it does not work very well here because of the delays which have been mentioned by previous speakers. One of the difficulties is that the authorities insist on maintaining IFR spacing-that is, instrument flight rules spacing for aircraft flying in instrument conditions-in visual conditions when the aircraft crews can see each other. When the cloud cover is such that the visibility is good, IFR spacing is still maintained. As Senator MacGibbon pointed out, with three miles to run to a runway, aircraft in Australia would have absolutely no other aircraft in the airspace. In the United States, Europe and Japan a number of other aircraft could be lined up on their final approach. That is the way aircraft are moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another very odd thing that happens in Australia and which accounts for a great deal of congestion at Kingsford-Smith-I have observed it myself-is that Australian authorities still have not recognised the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of helicopters. They force helicopters to follow the same procedures as fixed-wing aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon-Absolutely absurd.</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator SANDERS" NAMEID="1J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator MacGibbon says, it is absurd. They force helicopters to hover along a taxiway-of course, helicopters cannot taxi-to the active runway and then take off on the heading of that runway and depart. Every other place in the world that I have seen recognises that helicopters have unique flight characteristics and they are operated away from fixed wing aircraft. Here in Australia we compound our already congested traffic control systems in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport by making helicopters operate in the same manner as fixed wing aircraft, thus clogging up the system. The helicopter operators do not like it, the fixed wing operators do not like it, yet the Government still seems unable to change its system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of evidence given by the Australian International Pilots Association (AIPA), the Committee states at page 26 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> Essentially we are talking about World War II or Korean war equipment . . . the radarscopes are big round screens, as you would expect, with big square blobs on them and no other information.</PARA>
<PARA>What is being referred to is the fact that the electronic equipment at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is very outmoded. This is another misuse of the Government's priorities. The Government simply cannot invest in the most modern equipment or, if it does, the procedures are so slow that, by the time the equipment is actually brought in through the door, it is already outmoded. This is what happened in Melbourne, where the equipment was eight years out of date by the time it was finally installed. The report goes on to state on page 27:</PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority responded to some of these criticisms in a supplementary submission to the Committee. The CAA claimed that it was currently implementing an air traffic control re-equipment program and a new radar system would be commissioned at Sydney in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that not wonderful-four years down the track? The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the CAA stated that whilst the new system would ease the workload on controllers during peak traffic periods, it was not expected to produce a significant change in the traffic handling rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Why not, and if it does not produce a significant change, why bother to put it in? The fact is that the problem is probably not with the radar itself and it may not be entirely due to runways-once again it is with the procedures. There are also traffic delays in Melbourne. These delays cannot be due to a lack of runways because Tullamarine Airport has adequate runways. No one has ever criticised the lack of runways at Tullamarine. But what is criticisable is the procedures used by the controllers themselves and, apparently, the computer software in their radar equipment. It does not seem as though the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) can get its act together. It cannot run a complicated system which is necessary for the late twentieth century. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The CAA further argued that it was misleading to suggest that Australia's air traffic congestion problems were caused by its air traffic control systems, and that other major aviation countries were free of such problems. According to the CAA, there was no simple indicator of the efficiency of air traffic control systems and no simple means of comparing efficiency of the ATC system at Sydney with those of other airports.</PARA>
<PARA>What utter rubbish! Ask any Qantas Airways Ltd captain to compare the systems. When I go overseas I generally fly Qantas and, when I do, I wander up front and talk to the skippers.</PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator SANDERS" NAMEID="1J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, they are. Does the honourable senator know what they want to talk about? They want to talk about superannuation. But, after they have finished talking about superannuation, they talk about air traffic control systems and they unanimously say that the systems in Australia are the worst they encounter anywhere in the world; they are the least efficient of any systems in the world. I would suggest that, if the CAA really wanted to know what other pilots thought about its system, it would get a panel of Qantas pilots-retired Qantas pilots perhaps-to advise it on what is wrong with its system. If the CAA will not listen to me, Senator MacGibbon, the general aviation people or the AIPA, perhaps it will listen to Qantas pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many concrete criticisms of the system. If these criticisms were met and listened to in a fair manner by the CAA, the system could be improved very cheaply indeed. Basically, the solution is flexibility. Our system has no flexibility and I suppose that this is a result of the bureaucratic control which has been exerted over it. In many countries, including the United States of America, there is far more flexibility. On one occasion, when flying at night from Santa Barbara Airport to Los Angeles in a single engined aircraft, I overflew Los Angeles International Airport in a visual flight rules lane which meant that I was not under direct control. I was able to move in this lane above the airport-as Senator MacGibbon has said, the place above an airport is the safest place to go-and, as a courtesy to the approach controller, I simply mentioned that I was transiting his area. He asked me where I was going and I said I was going to Hawthorn Airport, five miles away. I volunteered the information that I was coming back to a conference at Los Angeles International Airport. That air traffic controller invited me to land at Los Angeles International. That would be unheard of in Australia. He invited me to land at that airport because he was the northern sector controller; he controlled two 8,000-foot runways which were closed to jet traffic but open to reciprocating engine traffic. The flexibility was in the system and he allowed me to use that facility. That flexibility does not exist in Australia and that is one of our major problems.</PARA>
<PARA> What about the runways? What about the problems of congestion? There are problems of congestion outside the air traffic control system at Sydney Airport. I believe that Senator MacGibbon has come up with the answer. I had already thought that his suggestion would be a good idea, but he beat me to the punch with his speech. Basically, what he suggests is not a major 3,000-metre, 747-standard runway, but a runway-or, perhaps, runways-for general aviation and commuter aircraft of 5,700 kilogram gross weight. This runway does not need to be much longer than, say, 1,000 metres. It does not need to support the massive weights of jet aircraft. It could be built very quickly and very cheaply. Basically, it could be built to the standard of a country road because that is the sort of runway that light aircraft use. They do not need a heavy runway. It could be in place very quickly indeed and it would take some 47 per cent of the traffic at Kingsford-Smith. That is the amount of traffic involving aircraft of less than 5,700 kilograms. If those aircraft could use this runway it would relieve the jet congestion on the major runways and it would be a quick, cheap solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> There probably will be further problems and in the future there will probably be a need for a jet-standard runway. But at the moment there is an immediate need to alleviate the terrible congestion problems, and this is one way of doing that. I note that page 57 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The FAC indicated that an additional runway involved `a lot of money' and that its first priority was to fix the international terminal. The FAC pointed out that it must remain free to explore all options for increasing runway capacity at the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>The suggested option is one which I have not seen mentioned by the FAC. I wish that it would study it. It certainly works at Los Angeles International Airport where there are four major jet runways and a parallel 3,000-foot commuter strip. It also works at other airports around the world and there is no reason to believe that it would not work in Sydney. I thoroughly reject the contention of the report and of the Government that a second airport should be built at Badgerys Creek. It is obvious that the most economical and best way to serve both Sydney and Australia is to put in a third runway at Sydney Airport.</PARA>

It is, in the Committee's view, a clear case of a witness suffering harassment as a result of giving evidence to a parliamentary committee. The Committee believes that it should be treated by the Senate with the utmost seriousness and that prompt action is required if the progress of the Committee's inquiry into drugs in sport is not to be impeded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I do not propose to reflect upon the facts that have been outlined by Senator Black, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I speak essentially for myself and not for the Committee. A number of sportspeople-witnesses-of world ranking have expressed real fear for their careers. I have no doubt that there are sports officials and administrators in this country who have not only condoned the use of drugs in sport but have actively encouraged their use in the pursuit of better results. The Committee has already been required to subpoena witnesses. I have no doubt that in the future a number of young sportspeople will also have to be subpoenaed, not because they wish not to cooperate with the Committee, but because they have a genuine fear and belief that, in the event that they are required to give evidence of drug use in sport, they will find themselves denied funding and facilities, find themselves dropped from national teams and, ultimately, denied the prospect of a world ranking and perhaps a record. In other words, the price of truth, they fear, is to have their careers dashed and the prospects of a future ranking dashed also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure we all recognise the enormous sacrifice that these athletes make in the pursuit of their endeavours. If witnesses are persuaded not to give evidence before the Committee, the work of the Committee will be very much frustrated and interfered with. If, at this early stage of the Committee's inquiries, it is derailed by the blackmail and/or intimidation of witnesses, the facts and truth will remain hidden. On the basis of the public evidence so far given, that would be a tragic circumstance for the health, welfare and future of Australian sportspeople and Australian sports in general. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been necessary for the Chairman on a number of occasions to reassure witnesses that they are protected by the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Perhaps for the record it is worthwhile that I repeat the provisions of section 12 of that Act. It says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When speaking on the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1988 earlier today I stated that I wanted to raise some inconsistencies in the Government's efforts to improve conditions for our service personnel. I point out that the specific exclusion of all enlistees to the armed forces since 14 May 1985 is not justified if we wish to see some improvement in the morale of those we ask to serve this country. This exclusion of young sailors, soldiers and airmen from the defence service home loans scheme is in direct contradiction to the bipartisan Cross report on Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force and its recommendation 33. Significantly, all service personnel have to complete six years service before becoming eligible. So it is not until 1991 that this exclusion will start to bite. This unjustifiable policy only serves to create two classes of service personnel-those who enlisted before 14 May 1985 and those who joined after that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another area where the Government has created divisions in the ranks of service personnel is on the subject of portability. My concern is that those who borrow after December 1987 have fully portable loans whereas borrowers before that date do not. Where is the justice in this? This action introduces yet another element of division between two groups of service personnel. The need for portability for older defence home loan borrowers is important because in many cases it would assist them to go into retirement housing as they become older. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to raise the issue of the size of the loan, which is $25,000. The loan was lifted to this amount by the coalition Government in October 1980. That was eight years ago. Since then, as we have all experienced in our various capital cities and States, there has been an increase in housing prices. Honourable senators should look at Sydney where the price of established dwellings has risen by 84 per cent in that time. The price has risen by 131 per cent in Melbourne and by 104 per cent in Adelaide. As all of us are only too well aware, this loan will barely give those eligible service men and women a start along the path to owning their own homes. It behoves all of us to address this matter as soon as possible to try to give a more realistic appraisal of those few benefits we grant to service men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> While I commend the Government on at least trying to get the matter corrected it saddens me that once again in this matter the Government has shown its total arrogance for the Parliament and the citizens of this country. I want to point out to honourable senators that they have been pre-empted in respect of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. What do I mean by this? What has been going on before this legislation has even been passed by the Senate? I will tell honourable senators what has happened. The Government said, `Don't wait for Parliament; don't wait for the debates in the Senate or the House of Representatives. Let's have some letters sent out to thousands of defence service home loan holders under the official heading of the Defence Service Homes Corporation even before the Bill has been passed through the Parliament'. The Government said, `Let the letter to all those service men and women and their families say in the most offhand manner, ``Just be advised that Westpac is taking over the scheme. A letter is enclosed from Westpac with some of the arrangements associated with this matter'' '. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has totally pre-empted the will of Parliament in an arrogant and out of touch manner. It is this out of touch manner, in total disregard for others, on which I want to make one or two points. Recently I asked Senator Richardson a question in this chamber in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I asked him when the Government would take action to correct some of the deplorable living conditions for military personnel. I cited in particular housing at the army base at Enoggera in Brisbane in my own State. That housing is in a state of shocking disrepair and not fit for human habitation. Ninety-eight per cent of the houses inspected had poor linoleum floor coverings, sagging ceilings, inadequate kitchens with little shelving and expensive to run stoves. Many of the laundries inspected were outside the house and infected with cockroaches. This is a dreadful situation when we consider that these conditions have not occurred overnight and have been developing during the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the record number of service men and women leaving the defence forces because of poor working conditions the Government should consider improving these living conditions as a top priority. I want to point out to the Senate this evening that it is about time the Government admitted to itself the total contempt and disregard it has shown to the Services by its failure to redress many of these inadequate conditions. It is no wonder that the Government is experiencing a serious defence morale problem when it expects our service men and women to live in deplorable housing or fails to grant them reasonable means to provide that housing for themselves. It only further aggravates that morale problem which it is finally admitting exists and is likely to continue for many years to come. It is time this Government stopped talking and proceeded, as a matter of urgency, to improve the conditions of service for those soldiers, sailors and airmen currently serving and those who have retired after many years of commitment to this country. We owe them that much at least. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendments that have been moved by Senator Newman on behalf of the Opposition. I would like to add that Senator Newman, in describing the Opposition amendment to be moved in the Committee stage, stated that it was the same amendment moved by the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White) in the other place. As she has leave this evening she has asked me to draw to the Senate's attention that it is a similar amendment with some slight technical differences. </PARA>

<PARA>`a person who during the First World War or the Second World War was a member of the naval, military or air forces of Australia enlisted or appointed for or employed on, service in Australia or'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Australian Democrats proposing the insertion of the new paragraph is to broaden the definition of `Australian Soldier' so that women receive precisely the same entitlement as males. Honourable senators will notice that the amendment refers to `a person who during the First World War or the Second World War was a member of the naval, military or air forces of Australia enlisted or appointed for or employed on, service in Australia'. In other words, it draws into the net of entitlement those few women who have been excluded by the previous definition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean's amendment may intend to do that but it does a great deal more. As it is worded, it would bring into the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill all the servicemen who did not have operational service. I think perhaps hundreds of thousands, certainly very substantial numbers, of people would suddenly become entitled. We should not do that, even as a request, by an amendment on the run. There have been arguments over the years that these people should be entitled to defence service homes; governments have not previously granted it. I am sure that if Senator McLean looks carefully at the effect of his amendment he will see that it eliminates the present requirement that World War I and World War II servicemen should have operational service, usually overseas but in certain circumstances in the northern part of Australia, because this covers them all. I do not think the Committee could accept that on the run at this stage. It is a very substantial amendment.

<PARA> 1. Page 4, at end of clause 5, add the following new subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) On and after 15 May 1991, the words added to section 4aaa of the Principal Act by subsection (1) are omitted from that subsection and, subject to subsection (3), the Principal Act has effect as if subsection (1) had not been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2), the Secretary shall not issue a certificate of entitlement in relation to an advance to a person whose first service in the Defence Force began after 14 May 1985, and no such person may exercise any right under that subsection, unless and until a new or amended agreement, concerning these persons, is executed, and its execution on behalf of the Commonwealth approved by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the agreement shall not be terminated by reason only that this section:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is not in the form in which it appeared in the draft Bill referred to in subclause 6.1 of the agreement; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has an effect of a kind described in paragraphs 6.1 (a) to (e), inclusive, of the agreement.''. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this amendment is to deal with a problem which the Government has handled very badly. In the Cross report, the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled `Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force', a very significant recommendation was made, recommendation 33, in which the Committee unanimously recommended that post-May 1985 enlistees should have eligibility for defence service home loans. This Bill does not meet that requirement. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) promised in the House of Representatives debate to look at the implications of recommendation 33. This is simply not good enough. We all know that this Government is one of disposable promises. I do not have time to go through all the disposable promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for instance. However, we must make it clear in this Parliament to those servicemen that this Parliament is determined that the Government will honour its promises. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of this Bill, based on the agreement with Westpac, puts the Parliament in an almost impossible position, because we cannot amend it without forcing renegotiations with Westpac. What we are saying with our amendment is that if the Government has not met its promises by 15 May 1991, the post-May 1985 enlistees automatically become eligible for home loans, and the Government will be forced to renegotiate an agreement with Westpac or a successor. It is a very sad day when this Bill is presented in this form, based on an agreement with Westpac and Parliament, in effect, is told by the Government, `You must not amend this Bill to overcome a clear anomaly because if you do amend it Westpac has the right to cancel the agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have, therefore, moved the amendment in the confident expectation that the Government will have no option but to support it. After all, one of the Government senators, Senator Maguire, is a member of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee when it unanimously recommended that this should be done. The amendment must command the support of the Democrats, because we are seeking, in the felicitous phrase of their founding leader, is `to keep the bastards honest'. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, we cannot support this amendment because it does more than keep the bastards honest; it actually serves the needs of another group, Westpac, because it inadvertently hands an additional prize to Westpac for which it would not pay and for which it did not bid. The legal advice I have is that the effect of this amendment is to grant to Westpac the privileges of the post-1985 borrowers whose needs certainly have to be addressed. We certainly concur with recommendation 33 of the Cross report. We certainly accept the fact that this anomaly is a contributor to low morale and probably, therefore, to the wastage of service people. However, we cannot condone the fact that Westpac came to the table and negotiated a deal. As a result of that deal, the Bill which is now before us was drafted to provide Westpac with an escape clause under which it can, if it so wishes, escape from any amendments which are made. The Democrats cannot go along with that rationale and, in addition, automatically provide to Westpac gratis, without a dollar going into the public purse, the bonus of the harvest of the post-1985 borrowers. We confidently believe that the Minister will address this anomaly very soon. We believe that it will be resolved in the interests of the post-1985 borrowers, but we cannot accept that in that process Westpac will get an enormous additional bonus to its harvest for which it paid $100m. It was a pretty good buy at that price, but it is completely unacceptable that this additional bonus should be thrown in without the taxpayer receiving some benefit from it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean has given some of the reasons, which the Government shares, why this amendment should not be accepted. Perhaps I should give some of the background. Westpac has paid a face value premium of $100m for the portfolio debt outstanding. In terms of present values, this premium is worth around $85m. It is a very substantial premium because it attracts additional business to Westpac which made a commercial judgment that it was worth that much money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the amendment that Senator Hamer has moved were to be carried, the effect would be to deliver post-May 1985 enlistees as captive clients of Westpac. While this is impossible to quantify, there is no reasonable doubt that that gift to Westpac would run into tens of millions of dollars. Whether it is $20m, $40m or $50m is very much conjecture. But there is no doubt that it would deliver to Westpac a very substantial gift. Westpac indicated to the task force which negotiated this sale that, of the $100m face value premium that the bank offered, some $50m was the value assessed by Westpac of having additional clients automatically flowing through to the bank-not just for the Government subsidised portion of the loan but for any additional loan. </PARA>
<PARA> As I am sure Senator Hamer knows, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, issued a press statement two or three weeks ago committing the Government to the introduction of a scheme for those post-1985 enlistees. </PARA>

At that time-and again this is not settled Government policy but is something that is likely to happen, I suggest-the Government is likely to call tenders or expressions of interest from financial institutions for the administration of a loan scheme only, or the option of a loan scheme or a lump sum. Whether it be a loan scheme or even an optional scheme, the Government would once again expect to get a very substantial premium from the financial institution with which it entered into an agreement to pay the subsidy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Review of operations</PARA>
<PARA> ``4ba. (1) On or after 9 November 1990, but not later than the first day of sitting of each House of the Parliament in 1991, the Minister shall lay before each House a report on the operation of this Act relating to the provision of financial assistance to members of the Defence Force and others to acquire homes. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure a review of the new program after a period of two years. We do not think it is reasonable that Westpac Banking Corporation should undertake the program at a reasonable price-obviously it has done its sums and knows it is worth it-and yet at no period subsequent to its undertaking the program be it called upon to account to those it is serving for the fact that it is rendering good service. We believe it is reasonable that at the end of two years an independent assessment and evaluation of the program be undertaken and its continuation be dependent upon the outcome of that evaluation.

That procedure will enable Parliament to consider the operation of the Act without the proposed amendment. The Government does not accept this amendment on two grounds. Firstly, we believe it is redundant. Secondly, should Westpac Banking Corporation have second thoughts about whether it has made a sound commercial judgment in offering that premium of $100m face value or $85m at present values, there is a possibility-these amendments came in very late and we have not had an opportunity to get expert legal advice on it-that any amendment to this provision would provide an opportunity to Westpac to get out of the agreement made, should it revise its opinion and decide to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, firstly, we believe the amendment is redundant as the situation is effectively covered by an existing clause. Secondly, it opens up the risk-I do not want to put any more strongly than that because I have not had an expert legal opinion-Westpac could get out of the agreement if it revised its opinion of the value of it from its perspective. </PARA>

We simply do not find that acceptable and we reserve the right to move amendments. If they are passed, I think we have to live with the consequences.

For the Minister to say that it raises constitutional questions as to whether it is legitimate for it to draft a document which negates an agreement between the Executive and another party, I suggest that it is even more constitutionally questionable whether it is legitimate for this House to have to bow down to a clause which negates its very constitutional process; that is, the right to review and the right to amend, and that is the process that we are now applying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to ask the Minister a question seeing that he has raised this question of constitutional law which I accept is not on the basis of proper advice received on either side. When the Minister was speaking he said that there was a problem about the alleged interference in what he described as a `private agreement'. My question to him is simply this: If one of the parties to this agreement is the Commonwealth of Australia, how is it a private agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be more accurate, I think, to describe it as a legal agreement. I am not sure whether `constitutional law' was the right term to use, either. The point I was making, acting on the advice that I had been given on the run, concerned the constitutionality, I suppose, of a provision being written into an Act of Parliament which serves notice that a legal agreement may, a couple of years down the track, be broken because that provision is in that Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that the Government has not had sufficient time to deliberate over these amendments. That is not quite so. I had discussions with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, and, through her, with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Humphreys, a couple of weeks ago-it would certainly be in the order of 10 days. I put the outline of these amendments to the two relevant Ministers in writing. They responded in writing. We advised them that we would proceed with the amendments. They were drafted and circulated more than 24 hours ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to address the comments made by Senator Hamer. The Bill in its present form delivers almost nothing. For $100m it delivers very little to borrowers. The only thing it ensures is that defence personnel will not have to wait a qualifying period of 10 months. We said earlier that if they get their act together and organise their personal finances for the serious business of procuring real estate, that period of 10 months is of little consequence. The Bill does not deliver portability. It does not deliver any significant change to the favoured sum borrowed-we are proposing an increase from $25,000 to $45,000. It does not deliver to the post-1985 borrowers. It delivers virtually nothing. And the Government tells us that we cannot amend it in a manner that will rectify its inadequacies and in a manner that has been requested by the associations that represent the potential borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> For us to pass the Bill in its present form is to do little more than to deliver to Westpac an absolute gift in exchange for very little into the public purse. I believe that we have not only an obligation to amend the legislation and to render it effective but also the right to do so. We should not back away from that because we are being threatened that Westpac will withdraw from a deal which gives it everything, which gives the potential consumer virtually nothing, and which also gives it the opportunity to do what it is already doing, which is to canvass its broader banking services. Honourable senators may have read the letters that were prematurely sent by the Defence Services Homes Corporation and by Westpac to present borrowers which, in paragraph 3, started promoting the broader banking services that would be available. I suggest to honourable senators that not only are we entitled but also we are absolutely obliged to serve those whom we say we are serving by this legislation. The Government says that. The Opposition says that. We say that the need is there. So let us produce legislation which delivers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is quite a lot in what Senator McLean says. As one of his former profession, a general, once said, war is an option of difficulty and so is politics. In this case we are confronted, as members of the Senate, with a Bill that has been described several times as being in a thoroughly unsatisfactory state. It has taken the Government 3 1/2 years to produce it. Frankly, we do not want to spend 3 1/2 years going through the consequences of renegotiating as a result of amendments made here. The benefits are more than Senator McLean has itemised. I do not think now is the appropriate time to go through the benefits of the Bill as a whole. That time was the second reading debate. I do not propose to repeat those benefits. Nevertheless, there are substantial benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is not in an ideal form. The form in which it is brought before the Parliament is very unsatisfactory. I agree entirely with what Senator McLean said about the standover tactic that we cannot amend it because it will affect the negotiations with Westpac. However, that is not our decision. We are confronted with legislation in this form. I think that it has substantial benefits for servicemen. I believe that if we make significant alterations it would very much delay its implementation. For that reason we are prepared to see it go through in its present form with all the warnings of what is needed to be done to make it better legislation in the future. We will endeavour to hold the Government to the undertakings it has given to improve it. </PARA>

<PARA>We are pursuing the point of amending this Bill so that it has some guts; so that it is not utterly empty; so that it provides to service people what they require to stay in the service; so that it provides some incentive for people to join the Services; and so that it delivers what was promised by the Government and the Opposition. The purpose of the first amendment is to grant portability of the loan. By virtue of their frequent postings, service people more often incur the need to sell. The privilege of portability of this loan from one property to another is denied to a considerable proportion of borrowers at the moment. The purpose of the amendment is simply to extend portability to all borrowers under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment is to acknowledge the fact that at the time the figure of $25,000 was set it was meaningful. We believe that it now must be revised upwards to a more realistic figure of $45,000. This will mean that when a `privileged loan' is offered to service people at `privileged rates' there will be some substance to that claim. The amendment will ensure the amount is equal in real terms to what it was worth when this concept was first introduced. Despite the escape clause and despite the attempt by the drafters of this Bill to deny us the right to amend the legislation, because service people require it and because the Opposition says it supports the concept, we are moving these amendments. In the Opposition's own second reading attachment amendment it said it supported all these amendments. The Australian Democrats also approved them yet now the Opposition is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition agrees with the purpose of Senator McLean's amendments. They are desirable-we said so both during the second reading stage and in the amendment to the second reading motion in which we moved for more portability and for an increase in the maximum amount of the loan from $25,000, which we said was too low. Whether the figure should be $45,000 is a matter for argument. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended a figure of $35,000. Both figures represent very substantial changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate what I said earlier in this debate. The Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill is far from perfect, but its advantages are substantially more than Senator McLean has admitted. If we make these changes to it we will delay its implementation for a very long time, we fear. It has taken 3 1/2 years to get to this stage. We think it is substantially better than the present situation. While criticising this legislation as being inadequate, poorly structured and in some ways an insult to the Parliament in that it has come to us in this form, nevertheless we think that to adopt it is better than to attempt to amend it and cause substantial further delays. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Hamer's comments I accept that his criticism has some validity. It took very much longer to negotiate this agreement than I had expected. It is not quite right to say that it has taken 3 1/2 years because the legislation was not quite the same proposition 3 1/2 years ago. However Senator Hamer is right in saying that it has taken 3 1/2 years to get the legislation to the stage that it is now at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall speak firstly to Senator McLean's amendment No. 3, which seeks to make portable loans granted before 9 December 1987. For technical reasons, however, the amendment does not do that-or it does it only to a limited extent. It does not address clause 19 (2) of the Bill, which excludes portability on all loans with a term greater than 25 years. In other words, it would apply only to loans granted before that date for a term of less than 25 years, of which there are very few. Furthermore, it also raises the question as to whether anyone who had ever had a defence service home loan would gain access to portability. If so, the cost would escalate enormously, as up to 280,000 persons who had previously had a loan but who had discharged their loan would become eligible for further assistance, which would almost double the current eligibility pool. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the other four amendments, numbered (4) to (7), which Senator McLean has moved, I can find no reference in the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading to increasing the amount of the loan, let alone increasing it to $45,000, which is the purpose of Senator McLean's amendments. If this were to happen-this is not a hard figure, because an assumption is built into it about the prevailing level of interest rates and, therefore, the size of the interest subsidy-based on interest rates being at about their present level, the total cost of accepting that amendment over a five-year period would be about $230m. So it is an extremely expensive proposition. Those people who have already taken out loans, with otherwise identical qualifications would have a $25,000 loan. Future applicants, with otherwise identical qualifications with respect to the duration of the service and also the time at which the service was performed, could receive a significantly enhanced loan compared with those who received a loan previously. I do not think that is very equitable. For those reasons, the Government will not accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has attacked the credentials of my Party, especially its Liberal credentials, in answers to several questions he has given recently. I do not contest his right to do so or to be as vigorous as he likes in answering questions. For example, on 30 September in answer to a question Senator Walsh said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Not even the Liberal Party of Australia, with the possible exception of the very recent period, ever actually made a virtue of ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA>I deny that the Party has ever made a virtue of ignorance and I would like to explain that in a moment. On 12 October Senator Walsh in answering another question said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I suppose from the exposure of their intellectual sloth and moral humbug . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on about that. I deny the charges of sloth or moral humbug as well. Finally, Senator Walsh, in objecting to our stand on a particular piece of legislation talked about the Liberal Party pandering to people, saying that we took our political positions for reasons which were not admirable. I do not accept his criticism of the Party. I do not accept his criticism of our more conservative colleagues within the Party. I certainly do not accept his criticisms that there is intellectual sloth in the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate a quite outstanding address given by one of my friends, the Hon. Ian Macphee. It was the farewell address of the patron of the Victorian Young Liberal Movement given to that movement on 27 November 1988. The address actually contained a couple of infringements against standing order 418. I have taken the liberty of editing those out. I seek leave to table the speech which Mr Macphee made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 24 August 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At what level is the counselling program conducted by senior officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs now being conducted through the Returned Services League Clubs throughout the nation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator Reynolds</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The counselling program conducted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) is known as the ``country visits'' program. This program is carried out by experienced and knowledgeable officers of that Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The program of country visits for each State is calculated to reach as many entitled and potential beneficiaries as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Centres which have a high concentration of veterans are visited on two or more occasions each year, having regard to the response to and claims on the time of the visiting officers on their previous visit.</PARA>
<PARA> When the program is developed for each State, arrangements are put in place to ensure that local RSL and other ex-service organisations are informed of the program and advertising is placed in the local press. Local members of both the Commonwealth and State Parliaments are, in most cases, informed when DVA officers are visiting their electorates.</PARA>
<PARA> The visits are generally held in the RSL clubs or, if this is not possible, in the local community facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Because the Department is very much aware of the increasing age of its clientele, the country visits program has been expanded to include visits to retirement villages and nursing homes. This expansion will continue and include other venues when required.</PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the Department is currently undertaking a review of the program with the aim of further extending its facilities to accommodate the special needs of clients.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No, but it is a very successful program which has always been regarded as successful by both the ex-service community and the Department.</PARA>
