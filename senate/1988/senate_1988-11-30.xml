<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators Durack and Gietzelt are not currently in the chamber. Apart from Senators Durack and Gietzelt, I do not think there are any current senators who were here at that time. Jack Little was one of those senators who held the balance of power, and it is interesting to reflect that it is only a relatively short time since then. Jack Little was a colourful speaker; it has been said that he was able to speak under water. The difference between Jack Little and many others was that he made sense on any subject on which he spoke. He was quite an orator. He came through the trade union movement the hard way and, on many occasions, had to speak against all odds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jack Little was once President of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Throughout his lifetime he served the workers. In fact, he was only 41 at the time of the traumatic events in the Victorian Branch of the Labor Party in 1954-55. Those must have been difficult times for Jack Little. It must have been a difficult political choice for him to have made at that time because he had a young wife and a young family. We need to recall the sacrifices that persons such as Jack Little made. In 1952 he was elected as a member of the Legislative Council for Melbourne North and remained so until 1958 when he lost his seat. He was a very active unionist in the Boot Trade Employees Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that his funeral service is to be held today at 11 o'clock. He had been ill for at least two years and I would like to join the Government and the Opposition in expressing my sympathy to his wife, Ila, and their two married sons and their families. </PARA>

<PARA>The Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is twofold. It is:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. to prohibit the importation, sale or hire of ``X'' rated videos;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. to reduce the violence in ``R'' rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> As Deputy Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, I have waited patiently for the Government to respond to the majority report of that Committee brought down in April 1988. The accepted timetable for the Government's response to Committee reports is three months Mr President, it is now seven months since the tabling and the Government has only in the last couple of weeks reported to the Senate. The response was a complete farce. It has hidden behind a supposed need for a further committee of their Caucus to be set up to make sure there is no supposed confusion about what ``X'' rated videos are and to review the level of violence in videos. What the Government has really done is to acknowledge it intends to support the multi-million dollar, hard-core porn industry, despite the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee and against the expressed wishes of all the Attorneys-General of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 June this year following the tabling of our report all the Australian Attorneys-General met and as a result of that meeting an unanimous agreement was reached between the States and Commonwealth Attorneys-General. It was agreed that most Australians wanted ``X'' rated and excessively violent videos outlawed and that the way to accomplish this was that there should be a national approach on the issue. This was necessary, Mr President, because while all the States have for some time banned the sale or hire of ``X'' rated videos under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth had refused to do so in the Territories, resulting in the free trade of these videos being carried out between the States and Territories and so thwarting the States legislation. Mr President, the Government had so strongly supported these ``X'' rated videos that over a period of four years it has delayed time and time again any action being taken to support the States in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Government members claim adults should be able to see and read whatever they choose, believing that there should not be any censorship. However, they happily go along with the need for censorship of child pornography, bestiality etc . . . It is really only a matter of where the censorship line is drawn not whether there should be censorship. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee hearings, evidence was given by many social and behavioural science researchers that they believed prolonged viewing of ``X'' rated videos could have very detrimental effects on certain individuals with aggressive tendencies but perhaps the evidence I appreciated most was given by Professor Sheehan of the Queensland University when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the critical thing in whether or not there will be these so-called effects of sexually explicit material is how aggressive the person is in the first place . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that a lot of people are stimulated mildly or strongly by seeing sexually explicit material. When one is aroused one tends to behave as a consequence of that arousal and I think if the person is aggressive aggression will out . . . In and of itself, I do not think that sexually explicit material divorced from aggression leads to strong negative effects. Once you combine sexually explicit material with aggression you have a different kettle of fish . . . The critical thing is how much someone is aroused and how aggressive he is in the first place (Joint Select Committee Report p. 207)</PARA>
<PARA>When you consider that evidence in conjunction with the other evidence we received, Mr President, and you look at it in light of the latest Australian survey on domestic violence which shows that 22 per cent-or one in five-of Australian men are so aggressive that they believe it is acceptable for a man to use physical force against his female partner then we have a potentially explosive situation. Females of all ages feel threatened and are becoming increasingly concerned for their personal safety. Women's groups throughout Australia have expressed their concern, they have a right to be protected. It is ironical, Mr President, that ``X'' rated videos are considered too degrading to be shown in cinemas but are considered by this Government suitable for home entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Bill is to reduce the degree of violence in ``R'' rated videos. As a Committee we had great difficulties in finding suitable words that would permit the showing of the every day ``cops and robbers'' videos but exclude those depicting extreme violence. Presently the Film Censorship Board's guidelines exclude videos that depict ``detailed gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty.'' I have added the word relished so that it now reads ``detailed, relished or gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty.'' This will remove all depictions of acts showing people enjoying committing violence and I believe will certainly remove the worst type of violence that is of such concern to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, my Bill has a clause that will permit, with the Attorney-General's approval, an organisation to import video material to be screened at a special event. An example of this would be a film festival. It also allows the Film Censorship Board to classify material which it considers of such educational, cultural, scientific, historical or cinematographic significance that it is in the public interest for it to be classified. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I believe it is vital that this Bill be supported. Action must be taken to stop the increase in the incidence of violence in this country. In the past 10 years the incidence of serious assault has increased 228 per cent, while the incidences of rape has increased by nearly 140 per cent. We cannot ignore these figures or make excuses by attempting to find fault with them. </PARA>
<PARA> As legislators, it is our responsibility to do everything in our power to make Australia a safer and happier place in which to bring up our families. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion for disallowance of this determination by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) to disallow approximately half of the pathology services that are currently available. The action is typical of the way the Government is handling health services in Australia today. It seems to me that it has allocated 7.5 per cent of its tax revenues to health services and is now cutting the services willy-nilly here and there in order to keep them below its 7.5 per cent allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The determination was brought into the Senate two days after it came into effect. We were debating it here, realising the disastrous effects it would have on our pathology services in Australia, after it had already come into effect. The Health Minister would not listen to any reason at all. The pathology services in Australia were going to have to alter all their computer programs, at enormous cost, only to have, we hope, the determination disallowed. However, he went ahead willy-nilly. A court case ensued. The debate was delayed and now the matter has come on for determination by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that during the formation of this determination there was very little consultation with the pathology services. In Australia we have developed probably the best service in the world. The pathologists had had, admittedly, years of plenty, but they had developed services which applied to both city and country, whereby one could get same day service for one's pathology results, and these services took the load off the Government's services and those supplied by the State governments. Admittedly, there had been examples of overservicing, but this was as predicted and expected, and surely could have been corrected without the blunderbuss approach that the Government has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition agrees with the Government's thrust to contain costs and reduce abuses. The two main pathology groups in Australia, the Royal College of Pathologists and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, agreed fundamentally with the Government's aims. They were assured that this measure of cutting out half the services that attract Medicare rebates would be revenue neutral and was designed only to prevent abuses. The pathology groups accepted the Government's means of attacking the problem. They were mollified by reassuring statements from the Minister. But on detailed examination of the proposal-a working model was designed-they found that their patients would be profoundly disadvantaged. These findings, by the way, were verified by two private accounting firms and by the Department of Community Services and Health. But the Government has attacked with a heavy hand, as it did recently with the pharmaceutical benefits restrictions which largely had to be reversed. We debated that problem in the Senate last month. In effect it was a similar kind of determination to this one the Government again used a blunderbuss approach. The Government, thinking only of cost containment measures, has struck virtually half the pathology services available from the Medicare schedule. This will have an immediate effect in that the income of private services will drop by 15 to 20 per cent and the State services by approximately 30 per cent. The kind of services available from private and public services will be reduced because their income will be cut so severely. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural areas, of course, will be particularly affected. The collection of specimens will be affected. The same day service will have to be abandoned. Many people will be put out of work. On a conservative estimate, in Queensland alone, about 2,500 people will lose their jobs. This will further overload public services which are already overloaded. They will not be able to cope because their income will be cut even more severely than will the income of private services. </PARA>
<PARA> This determination will have a major detrimental effect on health care in Australia. It may even be a health hazard to Australia. Delays can mean the difference between controlling a disease in its early stages and even the loss of a patient's life. The pathologists have remonstrated with the Government, but their complaints have fallen on deaf ears. Departmental officers have admitted their mistakes. They argue that the new pathology services' table should come into effect the day before the initial debate on the matter in the Senate as planned, after which the pathologists could make representations to the Government on an item by item basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made a huge mistake with this pathology schedule determination. The financial effects are far more serious than it intended or than the pathologists were led to expect. By not responding to the pathologists' appeals the Government is maintaining its belligerent stance towards doctors and pharmacists generally, and now pathologists. Some pathology practices could go broke under the new schedule. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ4">Senator SHEIL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some will. But it is the patients who will be the ultimate losers. For a Government that promised the fairest, freest and most equitable health service in the world, it is now restricting the service so that it, in itself, is becoming a health hazard. The new schedule represents a direct threat to the practice of first class medicine in Australia. The core of the problem is, of course, Medicare itself, a service which promises free health care at the point of delivery, a promise which is impossible to fulfil. In fact, as the demand for services goes up and the budget for them goes down, the two are disappearing away from each other and creating discontent in just about every field of medicine in Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the Government is reducing the services in order to contain the costs to its predetermined Budget specification. It is really a cruel and inhuman way to attack the problem. The Minister undoubtedly has his socialist goal of nationalising pathological services in Australia and driving private laboratories out of business. If he persists with this kind of determination, it is likely that that will happen. The same-day service will be a thing of the past and the extra costs needed to make laboratories viable will have to be passed on to the private patients. Rural patients will, of course, be the first to suffer. There have been massive representations on this issued because it affects such a widespread number of people throughout Australia. It has happened despite warnings to the Government that it will have these detrimental effects. The Government has pressed on regardless and this has caused no end of disruption to the services. </PARA>
<PARA> I understood that originally the Australian Democrats were disposed to act in a humanitarian and Hippocratic way with regard to this determination and to support the Opposition in rejecting it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really believe that is the issue on which the Democrats have made their determination. As far as I know they were informed by the chairman of the committee that inquired into this that these pathologists were earning $400,000 a year, so they believed they were ripping off the system, they were greedy doctors-all the usual charges that are laid against doctors. But they did not take into account the costs of running a practice and how much it costs to provide all these services. Just looking at the gross overall figure, the Democrats have decided that the pathologists are earning too much so they will cut them down to size. That is not the situation at all. Certainly by providing services on a wide scale pathologists do have big incomes compared to other people, but there is an enormous cost involved in getting those incomes. They willingly pay that over the years and this has led to a Rolls-Royce pathology service in Australia. The Democrats want to cut it to a Mini Minor type service and that will be to the detriment of us all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are consistent; they did sell out to the pharmacists, and then the Government had to change its mind in that case and had to reinstate a lot of the items that had been struck off the pharmaceutical benefits list. To my mind the Democrats are just political tumbleweeds. They blow with every wind and hope that it is favourable for them. They are not really concerned with the issues at hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The action of the Government in this case is entirely consistent with its belligerent stance on health services in Australia. That does not just extend to the doctors, the pharmacists, the pathologists and the radiologists but also to the nursing homes and hostels. This morning we had representations from the Victorian nursing homes and hostels about the way in which they are being cut down in the same broadsword, across-the-board fashion. That is just not good enough. The Opposition will oppose it, and I express my disappointment with the Democrats' whole attitude to these problems. They have taken their minds off what is good for Australia; they think they are doing what is good for the Democrats but it is not even good for them, as is shown by the fact that the Government had to reverse the decision that it took on the pharmaceutical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is moving to disallow this regulation which is, I think, the only sane and humane thing to do. To expect the pathologists to accept this kind of treatment and then go back to the Government and negotiate on an item by item basis is unprofessional and uneconomic. The effect on the patients concerns me most. I wholeheartedly reject the attitude of the Minister for Community Services and Health to this determination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly to this disallowance motion. I would like to begin by addressing the process because Senator Sheil and some of his colleagues including, much to my surprise, Senator Puplick on the front bench, seem a bit bemused by it. Relatively frequently the Australian Democrats, in the first instance, support the Opposition in moving for the disallowance of regulations. That is a process which has taken place before and quite possibly will take place again on the basis that that gives time for everybody to address the specific regulations, the issues underlying them and the concerns of the community. Indeed, that has been done before. I have been party to that process in some of my portfolio areas, just as Senator Coulter was in this portfolio area. Unlike the Opposition or the Government, the Democrats do not come at issues necessarily from a narrow minded, blinkered and ideological position. It seems to disturb the Opposition that we use the time gained to consult, confer, consider and make decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the instance of pharmaceuticals, which was referred to by Senator Sheil, I make the point that while he seems to be condemning the Government for some kind of backdown when it actually made some substantive changes, he should consider that representations by the Democrats in expressing concern and our ability to act in this place from time to time may have had some bearing on that process. In this particular instance, as with others, we supported the motion to enable the disallowance to come before the Senate and, as I recall, we also supported extension of the time for the motion on a couple of occasions. Through that process of time and deliberation we have now arrived at the decision that now that the vote is before the Senate-that time having been given to the Senate-we will not support the disallowance itself. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, that has happened before and will no doubt happen again. We do not believe that the intervening time is a waste of time for anybody. For example, the extra time allowed the concerns of people involved in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) programs to be raised. As a result the Government has included a temporary item until the end of March of next year so that those concerns can be further addressed. I suggest that that is one concrete instance of this process, in which we have been engaged, being effective on one of the specific concerns in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil referred to the politics of greed and envy; he was ascribing those politics to the Democrats. But those are among the words that the Democrats would use in explaining one of the reasons for our decision not to support this disallowance. In none of the literature from pathologists complaining about the fall in income that they would have under the new fee structure has any indication been given of the pathologists' absolute incomes. I would like to give some of that information here now. The Senate should realise that the figures I am quoting are net figures, after allowing 87 per cent for costs. The average income of pathologists in private practice is $224,500 a year. The median income is $203,000. A few private pathologists actually receive over $400,000 per annum and the lowest income is $87,000 per annum. I repeat that these figures are net figures after allowing 87 per cent for costs. And we are accused of the politics of greed and envy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil used the term `unprofessional' in complaining that, subsequent to the passage of these regulations, pathologists and others concerned will have to make approaches on individual issues and items. He said that that was unprofessional. I find unprofessional the fact that a letter is being given by private pathologists to patients blaming the Democrats for the increases which will occur subsequent to the passage of this determination. I consider that to be highly unprofessional. Of course, we had been informed of that prior to the vote on this motion today. I think it indicates a willingness to get involved in an unacceptable approach which could be labelled an attempt at blackmail. So if we are talking about unprofessional behaviour, I certainly think that is a problem to which attention should be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still some anomalies in the system; there always will be in this kind of process. As I have said, one of the problems has been allowed for in the IVF area and that is something which we are pleased about. There are some anomalies and it is within the purview of the Government, and certainly of the Minister, to address those anomalies. I have no doubt that, after the opportunity that has been provided by the time that was given via our original support of the motion moved by the Opposition, those concerns have been brought to the attention of the Government, and I have no doubt at all that they will continue to be. We have no objection to that and we will support these expressions of genuine concern. Further, I have no doubt that the Government will address those concerns where they can be shown to be genuine in terms of the real issues and not some emotional appeal to us, as decision makers in this place, about a loss of income for a most privileged group of people in the community. So the Democrats will not be supporting this disallowance motion. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

It certainly keeps the Government on its toes when it hears that, in a particular instance, the Democrats will not support us but that they will support a disallowance motion. That certainly forces this Government to advance strong and clear arguments. That is part of the parliamentary process. Senator Sheil has been here long enough not to get upset by it. Really, I have very little else to contribute to this debate. I will defer to my honoured colleague from Western Australia who has graciously deigned to appear in the Senate to discuss these matters with us.</PARA></TALK.START>

Obviously, I oppose the disallowance motion and, in doing so, I will start my presentation with a series of quotations. The first is from the Hansard of 11 September 1985.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is two months short of the 10 year anniversary. Having made that point, let me leave it aside, because it is a disgrace to this chamber that that event occurred at all. I quote from the Hansard of 11 September:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, pathologists operate in an environment where for the unethical the possibility exists to make extra money. It is up to the Parliament-it is up to the Government-to ensure that those loopholes are closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Philosophically, the Liberal Party of Australia endorses and encourages entrepreneurial endeavour, but in the sense that it is applied in this report, that activity, I must emphasise, is indeed repugnant. </PARA>
<PARA>The quote goes on in a similar vein. On that occasion the speaker turned also to the document that was being debated-the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on Medifraud-and quoted approvingly these words:</PARA>
<PARA> It was only when the automated machines came on the market that a very few clever, let us not denigrate their intelligence, a few extremely clever medical entrepreneurs saw their opportunity. They had a vision of buying some expensive machine, putting a person in front of it, making a million dollars-and they did. The little people will be squeezed out because they do not have that mentality. </PARA>
<PARA>My third quote is from another speaker in the same debate, this time on 11 November 1985. That speaker said:</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to devote my time today to talking about what probably constitutes one of the gravest threats to the revenue of the Commonwealth which has arisen in recent years. I refer to the growth of what has become popularly termed as entrepreneurial medicine. I propose to say something about the current situation as far as pathology is concerned, particularly in the State of New South Wales, and to say something about some of the persons, companies and organisations which are currently engaged in a major rort of the public health system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The speaker then turned to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled `Medifraud and Overservicing-Pathology'. He went on to quote a series of excerpts which are too long to retail in this speech, but I will pick up the quote where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 4.9 the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that many of the entrepreneurial medical schemes currently in operation violate at least two conditions outlined by Dr Thompson, i.e. they abuse the national health scheme and involve unethical behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>My fourth and final quote in this series is from the speaker I have just quoted. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement was headed `Pathology . . . a disgusting state of affairs in New South Wales!' Three eminent, respected pathologists, Doctors Michael Barratt, Dermer Smith and Michael Harrison, inserted the advertisement which, in part, read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately in NSW there are a significant number of medical practitioners who, as O.P. Approved Pathology Practitioners, refer their patients' pathology to pathology laboratories knowing full well that the standard of pathology performed by those laboratories is low and that by so acting they are placing their patients in danger. They are acting in their own financial interest by virtue of the fee split and are putting their patients at serious risk. These laboratories, by churning out reports which cannot be trusted, are a great threat to the patients of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>I could give further quotes. I have by no means exhausted the range of possible quotes to illustrate the point I am making. I have quoted just two speakers. The first two quotes I cited were from Senator Watson, a Liberal senator from Tasmania, speaking about the Public Accounts Committee report in 1985. The second two quotes I cited were from Senator Puplick, who has today moved this motion of disallowance, in the same debate, in his case on 11 November 1985. He was speaking in the appropriations debate and referring to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on medifraud. Those quotes illustrate one of the prime reasons why this Government has moved to a course which has now come to the Senate and which I hope the Senate today will conclude to enable the pathology services of Australia to be sorted out in a way consistent with good public administration, ethical and professional medical behaviour, and a concern for the economics of medical delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go to some of the details of why the Government has supported the report that is now the subject of this disallowance motion I wish to refer to some other documents. The Sydney Morning Herald recently, in the Good Weekend magazine-the lift-out magazine of that newspaper-ran a series of articles concerning entrepreneurial medicine. The body of those articles makes it clear to any reader that entrepreneurial medicine is a symptom of the malady which is endemic in the pathology services in Australia. I do not want to quote all of the most impressive statements, but I think for the record some should be put down. I will pick up on the second page of the article. In referring to pathology it says:</PARA>
<PARA>There are clinics dealing with anything from menopause to sports injuries. Billboards advertise: ``This week, $3 cholesterol test. Save $5 or maybe a lot more''. </PARA>
<PARA> In return, patients do not even have to reach for cash. The costs are paid indirectly and almost solely by the government through Medicare. The Bill for Medicare last financial year Australia-wide was around $3 billion which represented 135 million services. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about entrepreneurial medicine. On page 30 of this feature article, a major headline in the middle of the page says, `Centre doctors are offered possible future ``higher rewards for repeat patient numbers'' '. On page 33 under the heading, `Are you being overserviced?', the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>We used to call it McDonald's medicine-in and out with a smile and a blood test-we've always got a smile. It's part of the McDonald's service. (A doctor commenting on her job at an entrepreneurial clinic.)</PARA>
<PARA>On page 35 of this feature there is a picture of Dr Andrew Gibson of Pacific Medical Centres. The article reports him as saying that he has been offered tens of thousands of dollars by pathology companies. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 36, the concluding page of this article, it says under the feature headline:</PARA>
<PARA>``I've had pressure to do more x-rays.''</PARA>
<PARA>It quotes a doctor as saying that. No-one, not even honourable senators opposite or, indeed, the mover of this disallowance motion, on the record denies that there is a problem with excessive overcharging, excessive abuse and excessive problems with the Medicare system with respect to pathology. These anecdotal features in the Sydney Morning Herald are not something that I would normally rely on in making a point. However, they illustrate graphically in journalese the dimensions of the problem. It is common ground between independent and objective observers of the Australian medical system that there are problems in pathology which have to be sorted out. It is an area of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> What forms does the abuse come in? Let me give the Senate one example of a form of abuse which is of considerable concern to the Government. Doctors claim under an incorrect Medicare item under the schedule which will pay a higher rate for a simple test, and sometimes a claim is two or three times more rewarding financially for them if they improperly list a particular test under the old schedule. The new schedule that is sought to be disallowed by the Opposition will clean up that practice. I have another example of abuse under the old system: doctors will order a test and many more tests than are necessary to be performed will be performed, and each particular test will be charged. That is one of the reasons why fees are blowing out in the way in which they are. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Calvert" NAMEID="5F4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where did that come from?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an example of abuse that is known commonly and is detected from time to time. It is one of the things that the adoption by the Senate of the report we are discussing will help to wipe out. I would have thought that in the face of that type of thing we would not today be meeting full on a motion moved by Senator Puplick which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That the determination of the pathology services table, contained in Determination PST2/1988 and made under section 4a of the Health Insurance Act 1973, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>If that motion were to be carried, the sorts of practices which Senator Puplick himself has complained of, which Senator Watson has been vociferous about, which the Sydney Morning Herald illustrates, and which the anecdotal evidence I have given demonstrates, will be unable to continue. It is a responsibility for this chamber to defeat the disallowance motion and prevent that from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of what I have said, let me go back a little in time to the areas that were referred to by the report that Senator Puplick and Senator Watson were speaking to in 1985. In many respects that report is a tribute to the system of government in Australia which enables bipartisan scrutiny of issues of this nature. That Public Accounts Committee report led to a series of steps by this Government which culminated in the setting up of PSAC, which is a medical acronym for the Pathology Services Advisory Committee. I need to emphasise and underline the point that this body was set up with and on the advice and with the agreement of the Opposition and the medical profession. The body is composed of representatives of the medical profession, from the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and pathologists, to look at what can be done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been the routine, regular criticisms that attend the declaration of any matter which addresses a problem. There have been criticisms of PSAC that it has not consulted widely enough. The record shows those criticisms to be hollow: it has exhaustively consulted. I emphasise again that this body was set up with the approval and support of the Opposition and with the support of the medical profession, the group of people over whom it was to exercise judgment. It was chaired and is now chaired by a Deputy President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, someone used to dealing with issues of salary, reward, payment and meeting of obligations of individuals in the work force and in all walks of life at all levels of the work force. The Deputy President, Mr Justice Paul Munro, has served on the bench of the Arbitration Commission with distinction. The Committee proceeded to analyse, inspect, investigate and take submissions, and it has reported. </PARA>
<PARA> We are bound as a government under the terms imposed on us by the Opposition and by the profession-something that we agreed to at the time, it is true, but because of the urgings and lobbyings of the profession and the Opposition-to accept that report or to reject it, not to discriminate as to whether we accept it in part and reject it in part. We have the choice of throwing the whole thing out or accepting the whole thing. Faced with that choice and with the problems in pathology, the only honourable and proper thing to do is to accept the report and to defeat this disallowance motion. It is not as if the Australian taxpayer has no problems in meeting the cost of medical services in Australia. It is a proper exercise of prudent and responsible government to make sure that the best medical services are delivered at the most efficient cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Total Medicare benefits paid in this country in 1987-88 amounted to $2,881,786,339-not an insubstantial amount. Pathology accounted as a component of that for $426,102,006. That is 14.79 per cent of the total amount paid out in 1987-88 in medical benefits in this country went to the payment of pathology services. Also, it is not as if pathology services are not a growing component of the total payout of Medicare benefits. It has not remained constant. Medicare benefits for general practitioner services have grown by around 5 per cent per annum but the growth in pathology services has been 10 per cent per annum. So not only is a major component of what is paid to the medical fraternity for delivering services to patients being now diverted to pathology, the increase in the amount diverted is greater. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to underline significantly this point: it is important always to recognise that often where these sorts of abuses occur the vast majority of the people in the profession are not at fault. It is at the margins that unscrupulous practitioners ruin the game for everyone else. I think that is true here because PSAC is composed of people who give voice to the pathology profession and intrude into the considerations of PSAC the sensitivities necessary to see that pathology is properly and economically delivered in Australia in an orderly way. Therefore there does not need to be criticism of the body of the profession; it is those that abuse the system who should be criticised. That is an important point to remember. The majority of the profession, a majority of pathologists, I believe support what the Government is doing in sorting out the table that we have before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick for his assistance. I often do not need it but I am searching through my papers. An interjection is made that there was a scatter-gun approach. Honourable senators opposite may look in startled shock at that allegation. It came from their colleague, Senator Sheil. Honourable senators opposite may cleave to that interjection and not modify it but in some respects it denigrates pathologists themselves because, as I have said, pathologists have worked in PSAC along with other medical practitioners and experts to come down with this report. If it be a scatter-gun approach-an interjection I reject-that is not an attack on the Government but on the people in that Committee who brought down the report and on their expertise and professional standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wanted to go through a number of points briefly which I know will prove conclusively that the PSAC deliberations have been proper and orderly. First, the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, as I have constantly tried to underline, is not an unsubstantial body: it was designed to give the profession a voice in the maintenance of the pathology services table. It is a hands-off body for the Government: we accept or reject. The Committee is chaired, as I have said, by a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and there are two nominees of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, Doctors Carter and White; one nominee of the AMA, Dr Niselle; and there are three ministerial nominees-Professor Bell, a pathologist from the Prince of Wales Hospital; Ms Seyfang, a senior medical scientist from the Victorian Cytological Service; and Mr Read, an officer of the Department. That is the body that the interjection sought to cast a slur on. The College and AMA nominees in particular have a vast amount of experience in dealing with pathology issues relating to the various medical benefit arrangements. Dr White, for example, was involved as far back as 1970 when the first medical benefits schedule came into existence. Dr Carter is a vice-president of the Royal College of Pathologists and Dr Niselle is a former member of the Pathology Benefits Subcommittee. The ministerial nominees were also appointed on the basis of their potential contribution to the workings of PSAC. Professor Bell heads a large public hospital pathology laboratory and Ms Seyfang represents the interests of medical scientists who carry out the vast majority of pathology tests. Mr Read was nominated for his background in health policy and for his economic expertise. That is the body of which the criticisms are made. I think it is a body which any government would be pleased to empanel to advise it on a complicated field such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987 PSAC took control and direction of a working party which had been developing a revised pathology services table. The membership of the working party included the two College representatives on PSAC I have referred to and some of the other people I have referred to as well. The processes of the working party involve examination of the various documentary material on interpretation and revision of the table. Information on the incidence of claims against items on the existing table was made available by the Health Insurance Commission working party, which was also able to draw upon sources experienced in the administration of private pathology practice for the purposes of identifying the pattern of demand for pathology services. </PARA>
<PARA> At its March 1988 meeting the Committee noted a draft table prepared by the PSAC working party and proposed to consider it as an interim revision of the current pathology table. The Committee required that the draft be circulated on a confidential basis to various groups. The draft provided to the AMA included schedule fee levels proposed at that time. Fees were admitted from copies provided to the other professional organisations. Detailed comments were received from some groups, submissions and comments were considered by the working party and on more detailed matters there was, in some instances, informal discussion on points raised with representatives of the body making the submission or the comment. Submissions and comments were also available to members of the Committee, which considered and made amendments to the draft table, having regard to the comments and submissions received. </PARA>
<PARA> Representatives of the Australian Association of Pathology Practices (AAPP) met with the chairperson and the secretary of PSAC who put the views of the Association to the rest of the Committee. Suggestions and comments from the AAPP were at varying levels incorporated into the discussions on new pathology tables and were reflected in the recommendations. A recommendation on the new pathology services table was sent to the Minister on 31 July. The need to undertake this work and completely revise the pathology table had become critical for a range of reasons which had developed over the past decade. I have gone through a number of those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making these points: there is a problem. That problem has been bipartisanly recognised in this chamber. That problem has been a matter of popular comment in the press. That problem has been addressed by a joint committee of the Houses of this Parliament. That problem has been identified. That problem has been acted on by the Government. The Government composed a committee representing the professions and people skilled in making decisions on remuneration. That committee then took on a life in which it exercised its powers of investigation and forensic research, consultation and its obligations to then test against its client group its preliminary findings and modify and reassess those findings. That body sits on the basis of regulations-regulations agreed to by the Government but put to us strongly by the Opposition and the profession-that we accept or reject. Given the dimensions of this problem, the degree of consultation and the conclusions of the report, there is no choice but for this chamber to vote against the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful that the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, in his introductory remarks was kind enough to quote at length from a speech I made in the Senate on 11 November 1985 in which I took a leading role in drawing to the attention of the Senate the need to clean up rorts and improper practices within elements of the medical profession and, in particular, within certain sections of the pathology services area. It is perhaps interesting that on the front of today's Sydney Morning Herald we see the news that Dr Edelsten, the practitioner on whose practice my speech focused, has been struck off the register by the New South Wales Tribunal. I am grateful to Senator Cook for having drawn attention to this matter because it makes crystal clear the permanent campaign which the Opposition has waged to ensure that steps are taken to clean up the rorts and the economic-almost criminal-malpractices within the Medicare system. That establishes quite clearly our bona fides in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would not be here arguing for disallowance if we believed that the primary issue was one of financial malpractice. We are arguing for disallowance because we believe that the primary issue is proper health care for the people of Australia. It is interesting that, whereas on 2 November when the debate on this matter started, the Government's argument was `Here we are, trying to do something about the health care system', now the Minister comes in and says `What we are trying to do is to eliminate the practices of these thousands of fraudulent pathologists who are ruining the system'. The Government's argument, no longer being sustainable on its public health merits, has to be turned on the question of whether there are people out there rorting the system. The Government, no longer being able to sustain the argument on its public health merits, retreats-as it so often does-into an abuse of the profession and of the good people involved in the profession. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Minister to come in here today and make comments about why the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC) has to be regarded in a particular fashion, saying that its recommendations have to be in holy writ, when presumably the argument he has been putting in Caucus for the last couple of days about the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendations on parliamentary salaries is that it is important that the Government overturn the judgment given by the independent tribunal set up for this purpose, is perhaps a matter of some considerable interest to people who are looking for a degree of consistency from the Minister in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus on three matters: first, the extent to which PSAC has got the sums wrong and the fact that the determination should be disallowed because its calculations are fundamentally wrong. Secondly, I want to address the question raised as to whether this is a debate about the income of private pathologists or whether a far more important issue is at stake; namely, the capacity of the pathology services operating within the public health system to cope with this new table. Finally, I will come to the arguments put up by both the Australian Democrats and the Minister about the processes and about PSAC and its procedures in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that in the early stages of this debate everybody was told that there would be an impact on the incomes of pathologists and on pathology services of some 2 to 3 per cent. That was going to be the reduction in income. That was the basis upon which PSAC was making its calculations. We know from page 13 of the original report from PSAC, dated 31 July 1988, that when the Committee was asked to deal with the question of economic modelling in this matter it was unable to establish a proper and effective model which could be applied. However, the model the Committee did use led it to the following conclusion. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>When a similar exercise, that is to say essentially a modelling exercise, was attempted within some private practices variable results were obtained due to differing tests combinations. An overall reduction of 5 to 8 per cent was found but the statistical sampling was not large or widespread enough to give a clear indication in respect to the true financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>That 5 to 8 per cent made the rounds as the argument in terms of its potential impact upon pathology services. If, however, one looks at a minute D. J. Elias, Senior Adviser in the Health Benefits Division of the Department of Community Services and Health, addressed to Dr Deeble on 11 October 1988, one will find in Elias's minute to Dr Deeble, after having gone through the question of the examination of a number of practices, this comment:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall these data suggest the likely impact on practice income is a decrease in the range 15 to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, within the Department of Community Services and Health, between the PSAC comments of 31 July and the minute of 11 October there has been a revision, with 5 to 8 per cent now suddenly becoming 15 to 20 per cent. That is only in regard to private practices surveyed and says nothing about the impact in those practices within the public sector, where in fact that decrease will be getting up towards 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks, for example, at the minutes of the PSAC meeting which took place on 17 October 1988, one sees recorded the following references to comments by Mr Read, who was so comprehensively praised by the Minister just a couple of moments ago. At paragraph 3.8 of the minutes we read:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Read indicated that if the evidence of a possible reduction in the order of 15-20% was before the Committee when the original decision was made, then he would have made a different decision. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 3.11 we read:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Read feels the Committee is now in a position of defending a table on which it did not have a lot of information initially. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have in the minutes of the PSAC meeting of 18 October recorded comments saying that, had PSAC had the information that it how has available to it at the time when it was making its original determination in this matter, it would or probably would have made a different determination. One finds, in looking through the documentation which has now become available, that PSAC itself is under no illusions about the fact that it got its sums wrong and that if it had had the information available to it back in July it would not have made the determination which we are now seeking to disallow. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nothing could more clearly indicate the attitude of this Government than for it to be coming into the chamber with the support of the Australian Democrats and saying, 'We believe that PSAC is the appropriate body; PSAC has admitted that it made a mistake; nevertheless, that mistake must be sustained'.  That is what the Senate is being told today. </PARA>
<PARA>  The evidence is there, and admitted by the advisory body whose determination we are now determined to uphold, that it made a mistake; nevertheless, the mistake must be sustained.  That is the way in which this Government runs the public health services of this country.  The Government was told on 21 October, in an article in the Australian Financial Review by Julie Power headed 'Cuts in Medicare pathology schedule to save $100m':</PARA>
<PARA>A "revenue neutral" decision to halve the number of items on Medicare's pathology schedule has threatened the financial viability of public and private practices and unwittingly saved the Federal Government $100m. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is what it is all about.  It is all about the determination that a sum of money is to be saved and that the public health cost, the cost to individuals in our community, is to be set at nought against that particular determination. </PARA>
<PARA>  I look, for example, at the annual report of the Health Insurance Commission for 1978-88 which was tabled today.  When I look at the tables at the back, dealing with the numbers and percentages of services provided through the Health Insurance Commission system, I note that pathology services are shown in this period to account for 21.7 per cent of the services processed by a broad type of service and for something like 15.19 per cent of the benefits actually paid.  I do not believe that there has been any evidence that that in fact represents an incorrect, excessive or improper balance of medical services to be designated in terms of the pathology sector.  If, however, it is this sort of calculation upon which the Government is now basing the determination of public health issues, let me say that the radiologists and, indeed, the providers of optometrical services ought to be considerably worried about their future, when one looks at the figures which are in these tables, as to who is going to be next on the Government's hit list.  This is no way to run a public health service.  Yet that is precisely the sort of argument that the Minister for Resources who represents the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) comes in and puts before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of whether this is all a matter of rich pathologists rorting the system, which seems to be the sole argument that Senator Powell was able to put forward today. I raised in the debate on 2 October the particular problem of the Taylor Square Private Clinic run by Dr Basil Donovan, who is one of the leading people in Sydney involved in the treatment of the AIDS crisis. This matter was raised on 20 October 1988 in the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee F, where Senator Peter Baume was asking Dr Deeble some questions and demonstrating through those questions the impact upon that small private clinic of this new series of pathology determinations.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Donovan is not, I presume, part of the rip-off merchant syndrome that appears to have got so much under the skin of Senator Coulter and Minister Cook in the course of this debate. Dr Donovan is not such, so much so that one knows that the Government will have to make some special arrangements with him to allow his practice to continue to provide the services that it does, because his practice cannot continue to provide those services if this pathology determination stands as it is. Certain other arrangements will have to be made, without which the treatment of people who are HIV positive, or who are otherwise under Dr Donovan's care as part of the program that he runs at the Taylor Square Private Clinic, will be severely prejudiced. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to some of the other representations that have been received. I have here a representation from Dr Munro, of the Department of Anatomical Pathology at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. His letter has on its letterhead under the logo, might I say, these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the care of the Sisters of Charity. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Munro says that as far as St Vincent's Hospital is concerned the sustaining of this determination will have a major impact upon the way in which St Vincent's Hospital is able to carry out its work. He says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The schedule does nothing to correct the ever-widening practice of ``skimming the cream'' of pathology. By this I mean systematic concentration on low cost tests to the exclusion of difficult and/or unprofitable procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, St Vincent's Hospital says that it does nothing about the major problem which ought to be addressed but it does impact on a hospital such as Dr Munro's. I have a letter from Dr James Wiley, the Director of Haematology at the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, Victoria. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The new Pathology Table will have its major impact on public hospital laboratories because of the marked decrease in Medicare benefits for the more sophisticated tests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have representations that come from the Haematology Society of Australia. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The new Pathology Services Table would seem to be detrimental to good patient care in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA>I have representations from the Department of Medicine at Westmead Hospital, which says in effect that this determination will bring about the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The overall consequences of these changes must be disturbing to anyone with a social conscience-</PARA>
<PARA>from which one excludes the Australian Democrats-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) There will be two levels of medicine-one, ``bad'' practice, for the poor, another, ``proper'' practice, for the well off. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The genuinely sick in the community will have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Good pathology practice will either have to lower their standards of service or become bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a letter in similar terms from the Royal Melbourne Hospital, which says that the proposed schedule:</PARA>
<PARA>Introduces a financial disincentive to the detailed investigation of complex patients who are privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA>I have representations from the Department of Cytology at Westmead Hospital in the same sorts of terms. I have a representation from Dr Lowenthal, Reader in Medicine with the Department of Medicine at the University of Tasmania, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The new regulations which came into operation on 1 November 1988, will have a disastrous impact on small, specialist laboratories. These laboratories, which are sited almost exclusively in universities and teaching hospitals, often in conjunction with research facilities, are non-profit making and perform a vital role: they are the resource for the performance of difficult tests, for example for tissue typing for transplantation, for analysis of lymphocyte subsets for patients with leukaemia and AIDS or for hormone analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a letter from the Vice President of the National Venereology Council of Australia. It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that there is effectively a 60% drop in the rebate for standard sexually transmitted disease testing (eg. culture for gonorrhoea, antigen detection test for chlamydia, syphilis serology, hepatitis B serology.) The direct outcome of this cut in the rebate is that private pathology laboratories will be either reluctant to perform the tests (it will hardly be worth their while), and will direct practitioners to divert their tests to a public laboratory-(these are already overloaded with work from the public STD clinics), OR will refuse to bulk bill patients and will instead (to maintain their incomes) continue to charge the old fees (for which patients will only receive a very small part back on medicare). </PARA>
<PARA>These are not rich grasping pathologists. These are not pathologists in private practice who, because they are allegedly making large sums of money, have whipped up the Democrats into their self-righteous fury of indignation on the basis that somebody is being paid large sums of money. Given the choice, the Democrats will say to the public sector, the University of Tasmania Department of Medicine, the Westmead Hospital, the Haematology Society, the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent's Hospital and the Austin Hospital, `Let them all go hang. What the devil do we care about these people in the public sector?'</PARA>
<PARA> There are out there one or two rich pathologists creaming off the system, and the Democrats, the professional practitioners of the politics of envy, in typical Democrats fashion come in here and say, `Given the choice between the health of Australians and the viability of the public pathology practices and the incomes of a few rich doctors, we would rather have people potentially die and we will eliminate their capacity to have proper health treatment in this country because there might be one or two rich doctors making a bit of money out there'. Given the choice between getting stuck into a few allegedly rich doctors and protecting the public health facilities of this country, the right to public health treatment of ordinary citizens and the rights of hospitals like St Vincent's, the Austin and Royal Melbourne and the little laboratories at the departments of medicine at universities around the place, the professional politics of envy practised by the Australian Democrats is to be given preference. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell came in here and rabbited on about who makes $80,000, when her Party has certainly not been to the forefront in knocking back increases in politicians' salaries. She rabbited on about the fact that some pathologists might make a few extra dollars if this determination is not disallowed, and says to St Vincent's, Austin Hospital, Sisters of Charity, the Medical School at the University of Tasmania, the people in the Haematology Society, the people of the Taylor Square clinic and the people of the Venereology Council of Australia: `Bad luck. You can all go hang, because we are so concerned that there are one or two people out there making money'. For Heaven's sake, because there are one or two people out there making money they would close down the whole system on the basis of figures from the Pathology Services Advisory Committee, which figures were admitted in its own minutes in October to be inaccurate. That is precisely the way in which the Australian Democrats behave. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 November Senator Coulter said, `We will support this disallowance motion'. What happened? The judge who chairs PSAC and the members of PSAC were sent around to lean on him. They took him to see the Minister who leaned on him, saying, `Look here, Senator Coulter, people are making money. There are actually people out there making money from this whole thing'. Of course, Senator Coulter's jealousy hormones got all stirred up about the fact that somebody out there is actually making money, one thing he does not want anybody in this country to be able to do. Then, all of a sudden, because he has been given some shonky figures about the incomes of private pathology practices, he is off and away and has decided that once again here is a good opportunity to get stuck into people like that-and to hell with the public health consequences of the determination that he will make. Given the choice of putting the slipper into a couple of rich doctors or protecting the public health status of the people of Australia, he has no doubt whatsoever how he will come down at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when the figures are explained to the Democrats carefully and they are asked to do something as simple as to make a distinction between net and gross incomes, that in fact is a little too difficult for them. It is too difficult for tiny parties and tiny minds to sort out the fact that there are differences between these figures and the global figures with which Mr Justice Munro, PSAC, the Minister for Community Services and Health and everybody else have snowed the Australian Democrats. In order actually to sort out the difference between net and gross incomes and the differences between fee levels, gross revenue, payments to pathologists and an excess of pre-tax income over costs-under those circumstances-do honourable senators know what one has to do? One has to put prejudices to one side and look at facts. The capacity of the Australian Democrats to put prejudice to one side and look at facts does not exist. Indeed, if one looked at facts one could not be an Australian Democrat. It is by definition impossible both to have regard to facts and to have membership of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those circumstances we get to the situation that we have got to today. The Minister, having talked about how important and relevant PSAC is and how everybody is happy with this independent authority, of course did not indicate that the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia, one of the important constituent bodies of PSAC, at a meeting on 17 November, resolved unanimously through its Executive:</PARA>
<PARA> Having reviewed the procedures and operations of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee . . . both generally and with particular reference to Determination PST 2/1988, the Executive concluded that the present structure and procedures do not permit the views of the College and its members to be properly represented and taken into account, and unanimously determined on behalf of the College to request you the Minister to terminate the appointment of the members of PSAC nominated by the College, pursuant to Section 78H (3). </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are now brought back to a review of the principles which the Minister has put before us for the determination of this matter. First, he said that PSAC recommendations ought to be prima facie accepted because it is a body acceptable to everybody who is involved in the process. That was shown to be nonsense when the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia indicated that it wanted to withdraw its nominee from PSAC because PSAC simply did not work effectively in taking account of its views. Secondly, he says, `PSAC has all the facts. You bring the facts together, you examine those facts, you accept what they say'. The minutes of the last meeting of PSAC indicate, in the comments of Mr Read and others, that they got the facts on the prior determination wrong. Had they had available to them then the facts which they have available to them now-and I refer again to that quotation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the evidence of a possible reduction in the order of 15-20% was before the Committee when the original decision was made, then he-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Read-</PARA>
<PARA>would have made a different decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That 15 to 20 per cent figure is not my calculation. It is not a figure which I have plucked out of the air. It is the figure which appears in the minute from Mr Elias on 11 October to Dr Deeble-a minute within the Department of Community Services and Health headed, `Impact of New Pathology Services Table'. The Minister, having argued for the integrity of PSAC, finds that shot out of the water. Having argued for the validity of the figures which PSAC has put before the Government as its determination, he finds those shot out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> At no stage did the Minister, Senator Coulter or Senator Powell attempt to address the question of the impact of this determination, not on private practitioners but on the public sector, as far as the provision of pathology services is concerned. The reason they will not address that point is that they know the facts in this matter are absolutely compelling. They involve income reductions of up to 30 per cent. The administrative burdens cannot be coped with by the small laboratories or, given the size of the other end of the scale, by the large laboratories. I refer to the amount of paperwork that would be involved for such hospitals as the Westmead Hospital, the Austin Hospital and various others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot address its mind to what the Haematology Association or the National Venereology Council of Australia has to say, simply because the Minister found that the best tactic to win this debate was to go to Senator Coulter and say, `Here are the figures for the gross incomes of rotten pathologists. Why don't you get into them?'. That is why, when the Minister came in today to make his speech on this matter, instead of focusing on any of the facts that have been raised he led off with a discussion about Dr Edelsten and the rorts in pathology services, which those on this side of the chamber were attempting to have cleared up long before the Government was even prepared to get its act together on this matter. He knew that that was the way in. He knew that the way in to the Australian Democrats was to plead to the politics of envy, the politics of greed, the politics of division within this whole issue; not to address the public health issues, not to address the issue of the care of individual Australians, but to say, `I know the way into the Democrats' psyche: the politics of greed, the politics of envy, the politics which, at its most crude level, pitches one or two people, in terms of their gross professional incomes'-their gross incomes mark you-`against the actual question of public health issues and the health care of individual Australians'. That can always be relied upon in the Australian Democrats: if one can find the little niche to exploit the politics of envy and the politics of greed, which the Democrats are on about all the time, one will always be able to get them. One will be able to demonstrate once again that the Australian Democrats are not a political party to be bought; they are a group of people to be rented by the hour. Having found their price on this occasion, the Government has exploited it to maximum advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not proposed to involve myself in this part of the Committee debate, but my attention was drawn to Senator Walsh's rather infelicitous opening of the debate in this chamber on 29 November when, apart from being extremely rude about the speeches which had preceded his, he went on to refer to the amendment which was to be moved by the Opposition in the Committee of the Whole regarding the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1988-89. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It says that the Senate `reaffirms the resolution of 2 December' and so on, and `requires the Minister for Finance' to do this, that and so on. I repeat that this is not just a question of government policy. It is a question of the Constitution. The Senate does not determine its appropriations, nor does the House of Representatives, per se, determine its appropriations. Only Ministers of the Crown are constitutionally authorised to put requests to the Governor-General appropriating money. So the Senate can carry as many resolutions as it likes. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I want to make some comment about that is that it seems to me, quite apart from anything else, that it is very unhelpful when the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) takes up an area where there has been extensive bipartisan consideration of the issues involved, and bipartisan acceptance of an approach which should be adopted to deal with the real possibility of conflict between the Executive Government and the Parliament on this vital question of the funding of Parliament. The Minister at the table, Senator Walsh, knows, or should know, that the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee has, in the years that it has been established, always carefully taken into account the Government's financial requirements. In other words, the general budgetary approach laid down by the Government has been very carefully taken into account by the Committee in its consideration, and on a regular basis there have been negotiations between the Department of Finance and the parliamentary departments, and this has all gone back through the Committee and so on. There has been in most cases a pretty amicable settling on figures which are reasonable from the point of view of the Parliament and reasonable from the point of view of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is known to all senators that this year there was a rather pre-emptory approach on the part of the Department of Finance. I do not have the material in front of me and I have not refreshed my memory on it, but as I recall it, the Department of Finance and the Minister left us in a position where the Senate may well have to seek supplementary funding in the appropriations early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make now is that if Senator Walsh is going to take this macho and highly unpleasant and confrontationist approach, which he adopted at the commencement of this debate, I think he is being extremely unwise. I wish to say to the Minister that that is not the way to facilitate the dealing of these Appropriation Bills, whether in Committee or elsewhere. Nor is it a very sensible approach, given the difficulties that there are in bringing together the constitutional point made by the Minister, which relates to the control of executive Government over what matters are brought into the Parliament which will approve expenditure, and, as against that, the desirable constitutional principle that the Parliament should not just be the cat's paw of the Executive. The fact of the matter is that Labor, National, Democrat and Liberal senators have considered the issues that the Minister addressed in such a pre-emptory and unpleasant way last night. What we have done is to arrive at procedures which involve a degree of goodwill and cooperation between the Executive and the Parliament. The need for that is pretty apparent. The fact is that the Government has certain constitutional powers, but so does the Parliament. The Government cannot get its appropriations without the consent and support of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It would be, in my view, inflammatory and silly-childish would probably be the best word-for me to come into this place and start thumping the table and pointing out to the Minister that we have undoubted constitutional responsibilities and powers, and they include the power to refuse to pass the Minister's legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see a combative instinct in the senator for the Australian Capital Territory, Senator McMullan, but I suggest he show his more usual commonsense and consider the substance of the issues that I am trying to address. The fact of the matter is that the Minister, as part of the Executive Government, is an essential part in the chain of providing funds for any public purpose, including the operation of the Parliament, but so is this chamber and the House of Representatives. At the moment the position is that there is an all-party agreed position, reflected in the earlier Senate resolution, which arose from careful all-party consideration of this issue, which is based on both sides showing some commonsense and give and take. In other words, neither the Government nor the Parliament stands on its dignity and its high horse and says, `Since we have an element of constitutional power, we must have the final and total say'. If the Minister is saying that the Hawke Government is disallowing the approach which was laid down in that, as I understand it, unanimous recommendation of this chamber, which has been acted upon in the past and which this Minister now seems to wish to flout, I think he should be quite plain on that, because I think that poses a matter which is going to have to be attended to by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about this. I am not standing here and saying to the Minister that we would not pass the Appropriation Bills, because that would be a disproportionate response to the Minister's petulence, rudeness and flouting of the matters--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is typical of Senator Walsh. He will no doubt be complaining later about the fact that the Appropriation Bills have not been passed. The fact is that he has failed to bring these Bills forward for consideration in a timely way. That is not of our making. That is the making of the Government. He now cannot resist employing his usual bullying and rude manner to advance his point. That cuts no ice with the Opposition and I do not intend to respond in kind as there does not seem to be much point. I am glad to see that Senator Macklin is here for the Australian Democrats, because I want to make the point-and it is the point which, incidentally, was made last night by Senator Peter Baume, who spoke in the debate immediately after Senator Walsh-that if the Minister is going to adopt this rather childish standover tactic then clearly this is a matter which the Senate will need to address and I do not believe that we will be able to address it in any final, complete or proper form in this debate. I think we will need to look at the mechanisms which have been adopted, we thought on a unanimous basis, to see what substitute mechanisms are available to prevent the rape of the Parliament, the destruction of the independence of the Parliament by this or any other Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a number of intemperate outbursts over the years Senator Walsh has made it clear that, at least on his bad days, he would be prepared to use the financial power of government to limit the Parliament's capacity to carry out its constitutional functions. I speak purely from memory and the Minister may wish to correct me on some point of detail, but my recollection is that Senator Walsh, for example, has on at least one occasion suggested that he or the Government could prevent the Senate undertaking some committee inquiry or at least limit the capacity of the Senate to undertake a committee inquiry that was desired by the majority of senators by the use of that same financial power. I mention that because the capacity of this Parliament to undertake its constitutional functions is a matter of long term importance for this country. It is a fundamental part of the democratic structure under which we operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Walsh to bear in mind that we are not just dealing with a fight between political parties, which he thoroughly enjoys, we are not just dealing with matters which go to the re-election, or non re-election, of the Hawke Government, but we are actually going to the basic institutional arrangements. While it is true that I can stand here and say all the things that I think are totally distasteful, disgusting, arrogant and so on about the Hawke Government and Senator Walsh can stand up and fulminate about the inadequacies of the Opposition as he perceives it, that is not the issue here. The issue here is the extent to which these two elements of our constitutional structure can simply ride roughshod one over the other. I think this is a matter to which I would hope the Minister would give sober consideration, that he would carefully examine the considerable amount of work that has been done by the Senate to arrive at a satisfactory resolution of the potential conflict between those two constitutional structures and that he might, in a more measured, considered and careful way, advise the Senate precisely where the Government stands on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government stands where Senator Walsh's recent behaviour and recent words indicate-that is, if the Government believes that it has the right simply to ignore the views of the Parliament itself and simply to impose whatever financial regime it wishes on the Parliament-if the Government is casting aside the rather cooperative arrangements which involved a recognition of the mutual constitutional responsibilities of both the Parliament and the Executive, I think that should be explicit. It would then be incumbent on us to look at what options are available to the Senate-not in the full forum of the Committee of the Whole or of the Senate chamber itself but in some form of committee examination-to ensure that its constitutional position is properly protected. I suggest to the Minister that he remove this particular issue from the hurly-burly, if you like, of day to day political debate and look at it as a matter of important principle, which the Opposition certainly believes it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of our dealing with the balance of the Committee debate on the Appropriation Bills, I remind the Minister that there are some quite significant and difficult areas which I am sure will attract some debate. The Minister will be aware that in at least one case there is a very serious dissenting report on part of one of the Estimates committees in particular relating to the maladministration by this Government of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I simply suggest to the Minister that if we are to conclude our debate on these matters in some reasonable order, a higher level of civility than has been evident at the beginning of the debate would be very helpful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to concerns referred to by Senator Chaney, Senator Peter Baume and others on the consultative process between the Parliament and the Department of Finance in finalising the 1988-89 appropriations for the Parliamentary Departments, I draw the attention of the Senate to an exchange of correspondence with the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). The result of this correspondence is that the Speaker and I have instructed parliamentary officers to develop with the officers of the Department of Finance a timetable to allow for proper consultation in finalising the appropriations for 1989-90.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that a concrete proposal to achieve this goal will be placed before the Department of Finance early next week and I expect that this proposal will be adopted. It is anticipated that this will remove much of the controversy which marred this year's negotiations. The Speaker and I have also agreed to consider a suggestion from the Minister for Finance whereby an ongoing level of outlays for normal operations might be settled for the Parliamentary Departments, allowing the estimates process each year to focus on any significant additional items of expenditure considered to be essential. This is broadly the method by which the estimates of other bodies are handled, and it removes the scope for possible disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is recognised that there may be problems in establishing an appropriate base level of funding for the new building at this early stage, the Speaker and I have asked our officers to investigate this approach and for them to enter into discussion with Department of Finance officers. I assure the Senate, however, that this process, if adopted, will not diminish the authority and role of the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee with respect to the estimates for the Department of the Senate. For the information of honourable senators, I table correspondence dated 26 September and 10 October between the Speaker and myself with the Minister for Finance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended entering this debate but as a result of the comments made last night by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, I wish to speak to the motion moved by the Opposition in the Committee of the Whole on the reaffirmation of the resolution of 2 December 1985 and indicate that the Australian Democrats will certainly support this. We supported it in 1985 and we believe it should provide the continuing basis for operations. I am certainly pleased to hear the points raised by the President and I hope that an amicable and settled relationship might ensue from the processes that are being undertaken at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that another parliament which this Parliament helped to establish-the Parliament of Papua New Guinea-has, within the last six weeks, changed its own Constitution in order to take total control of the appropriation of the Parliament into the Parliament itself and away from the Executive. Obviously it has been meeting the same types of problems that we have within the Westminster system and has settled them in a rather dramatic way. In future the entire appropriations process for Parliament in Papua New Guinea will be carried out by the Parliament with no consultation whatsoever with the Executive. I think that would be inappropriate in Australia. I think that it is far better that we proceed in the way that we have in the past-on the basis of consultation between the two groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the outlay for the Parliament is fairly substantial and should fit into the overall budgetary context. I think it would be inappropriate for that amount of money to be simply a floating amount over which there was no possible determination or tie into other obviously needed areas of public administration. Likewise, I believe that the amounts of money being provided for the operation of Parliament, when put against the amounts required for the operation of the Executive, are not large. If we are determined to continue with a parliamentary structure, obviously there will have to be some type of development of the parliamentary structure. One that has taken place in the last few years has been the operation of parliamentary committees. But I foresee that, in a matter of years, there will be other types of developments, particularly those types of developments that have taken place within the last 10 years in the United States Congress, where certain specialised groups have been established-for example, a budgetary office. Such groups would allow the Parliament to have access to detailed information which has not been, and seemingly will not be, provided by executives to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a parliamentary system of government, parliaments need information. If that information which has been collected by the Executive wing of government is not provided to Parliament, Parliament itself must seek to gather that information. I think a far better, cheaper and more rational way would be for the Executive to share with the Parliament the type of information base that it has. To date, that has not occurred and it seems unlikely to occur in the future. I believe that the development which the US Congress had to engage in, for precisely the same reasons, that is, its Executive refused to share information with it, forced it into taking action that led to considerable increases in costs in developing material twice. The Executive can continue on an exercise, I suppose, in our parliamentary system because it has a majority in the House of Representatives and feels, therefore, that it is secure. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the likely disposition of groups within this Parliament, the Budget of the government of the day will always be passed. While my Party has the balance of power in the Senate, the Budget of the government of the day will always be passed. But that I do not think is the point, and I really do not believe that that is where the discussion ought to be. Rather, I believe the discussion should be about whether the parliamentary structures will be effective in our governmental system, or whether they will be increasingly marginalised, as they have been over many years. That might be inevitable; that might be the way in which we develop as a nation. It is not the way I would like our nation to develop, but that may be the way we go. While we are still a parliamentary democracy and while we are still spending considerable amounts of money on the operation of the Parliament, I believe that its functions and roles ought to be recognised and developed. One of its roles is scrutiny of the Executive's operations. That cannot be done without knowledge and information. For example, it cannot be done without at least a comparable computer system to the one that junior base grade clerks are using in almost every executive department throughout this nation. Without sophisticated equipment the job the Parliament is supposed to be doing will be merely one of rhetoric, one of show, and one which does not have any substance. If that is the way the majority wants to go, that is the way we will go. I think it would be a pity. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the parliamentary system has a lot of kick in it yet. I hope that it does. I believe that the only way it can be developed in a developing world-it cannot stand still; if it stands still it will go backwards-is to move forward in a way that will enhance the operation of individual members of parliament. I know that that is not necessarily something that executives or even opposition executives hoping to get into government, might like, but it is part of the genius of the system we have adopted. Unless we can come up with another system that protects the interests of individuals, I believe we ought to continue with the one we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with some warmth on this because I come from a State where the parliamentary system has been abused, denigrated and in fact destroyed. The parliamentary system does not work in my State of Queensland and I think that is the direct reason that we are seeing enormous amounts of corruption in that State. In a correctly operating system that has public accounts committees and that has a Parliament which gets to see the Bills before they are debated-which does not occur in the Queensland Parliament-and which is able to overview the entire operation of executive government we have a check which is effective. As one Opposition speaker said in the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bills, the system has shown itself to be effective at the Federal level. That is the genius of the system we have adopted. If we are to continue with it--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister's views are perfectly clear to him. As far as the Minister is concerned, that is where it will rest, and that is a problem we have right now, or at least it is going to be a problem he will have. The level and degree to which government is accountable to Parliament and the capacity which Parliament has to scrutinise the conduct of government ought not to be dictated exclusively by economic determinations of the government of the day. To create that nexus, in my view, places in the hands of a government the right to determine the degree to which governments are able to be scrutinised. Surely no reasonable person would support that proposition. From time to time there are those who judge Parliament to be the forum for oppositions, not for the representatives of all people. Not only oppositions ought to be scrutinising the conduct of government but all members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, the funding of the parliamentary departments goes to the very heart of the system of government that we have in Australia. Of course, without question, the level of funding dictates to a very large degree the capacity and ability of Parliament to fulfil its obligations and its functions. If funding is less than adequate and less than reasonable, the Parliament's constitutional capacity to monitor, scrutinise and judge the Government's conduct and its legislation fails. Under Senator Walsh's proposal, the Government could ultimately choke off funding to the degree that it would be almost impossible for the Parliament to begin to scrutinise, in an effective way, the conduct of Government. Senator Chaney's memory is quite correct; Senator Walsh threatened the Senate with removing funding to the point where a committee could not fulfil its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want for a moment to touch upon the correspondence which I suspect was included in that tabled by the President. Before I do so, let me say this: the present appropriation and staffing system we have and the resolution that was ultimately brought down by Estimates Committee A in 1985 were a result of a 1981 report of the Select Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, which was set up in 1980. That Committee was chaired, if I am correct, by Senator Jessop. It included members of the Democrats and, of course, members of the Labor Party, the Labor Party's representative being former Senator Douglas McClelland, who was very proud of the Committee's determinations and deliberations. It was he, I think, who reminded Sir Billy Snedden of the role that Committee had played in setting up a system of funding for government departments. The resolution of that Committee in 1981 was carried unanimously. If anybody examined the Hansard records they would find that nobody from the present Government, including Senator Walsh, rose to object to that fundamental principle in the same way as the present motion--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh chose to remain silent on that occasion and he chose to remain silent in 1985. He had his feet in his mouth when the resolution of Estimates Committee A was carried unanimously and when the Appropriations and Staffing Committee reported. That Committee was made up of all parties and included the independents. It had on it the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who presumably agreed with the resolution and the correspondence that flowed from it as he was a member of it. He did not dissent from the resolution at the Committee hearing or in the chamber. That resolution was carried in the Parliament unanimously without an utterance from Senator Walsh. He certainly did not record a contrary vote. Senator Walsh saying that the motion before us is as worthless as the resolution passed in 1981 indicates a contempt that he has for this chamber and is a reflection of his present attitude. Let me remind the Committee of the resolution that was carried in 1985 by Estimates Committee A, which was chaired by Senator Graham Richardson. It said, inter alia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the estimates of expenditure for the Senate to be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill shall be those determined by the Standing Committee on Appropriations and staffing. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no dissent from that proposition or from the rest of the resolution. The resolution stated:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) if before the introduction of the Bill the Minister for Finance should, for any reason, wish to vary the details of the estimates determined by the Committee he should consult with the President of the Senate with a view to obtaining the agreement of the Committee to any variation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If my memory serves me correctly, the first correspondence the Committee received on this matter was dated 1 August. On 1 August it received the first correspondence warning of dissatisfaction with the arrangements that had been made and the direction in which the appropriations were going. My understanding is that Senator Walsh's departmental officers, who had had consultations up until that time, had given no indication-and I am sure the President of the Senate will tell me if I am wrong-that there was any unhappiness in general terms with the estimates. The resolution further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the event of agreement not being reached between the President and the Minister, then the Leader of the Government in the Senate, as a member of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, be consulted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Walsh did not consult Senator Button. It is not on the public record. The resolution stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Senate acknowledges that in considering any request for the Minister for Finance the Committee and the Senate would take into consideration the relevant expenditure and staffing policies of the Government of the day . . . </PARA>
<PARA>of course, that has been more than done by any measure-</PARA>
<PARA> (f) in turn the Senate expects the Government of the day to take into consideration the role and responsibilities of the Senate which are not of the Executive Government and which may at times involve conflict with the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government, in my view, has not done that. There is no indication that Senator Walsh has a serious care or concern for the responsibilities and functions of the Parliament. Yet I am sure that he, as much as anybody, took advantage, when the present Government was in opposition, of the various select and standing committees, drew for sustenance upon the intellectual input into the Parliamentary Library and the various functions and services of Hansard, and used for his best endeavours all the facilities available as a result of the consideration of the appropriations. The first letter that the President received was from Senator Walsh, dated 1 August, which commenced:</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to you concerning the 1988-89 estimates for the Parliamentary Departments submitted recently to my Department. </PARA>
<PARA>To my understanding, that was the first indication that the Committee had that there were problems. So concerned were the President and the Speaker with discharging their proper responsibilities that they were moved on 5 August to write to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seeking substantial and, presumably, moral support for their position on both the chambers, not the least being the Senate. But that was a wishful hope, that was a vain endeavour, because the Prime Minister wrote back no sooner than 29 August simply saying that he understood that the Minister for Finance was writing to the President to advise him of the Government's decision on funding for the Parliament for 1988-89. I wish to refer to two other pieces of correspondence. The first, from Senator Walsh, states his position, which is worth recording again. On 26 September Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA> In your letter you note that in dealing with the estimates I have not had regard to the procedures laid down in the Senate's resolution of 2 December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter referred to was written by the President and the Speaker, no doubt with feeling and commitment, saying that they noted that in dealing with the Estimates Senator Walsh did not have regard for the procedures laid down in the Senate's resolution of 2 December, a copy of which was attached. Senator Walsh responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> You say also that you are firmly of the view that you are in the best position to determine an appropriate level of funding for the Parliament in consultation with your officers. As you would be aware it is the Government's prerogative to advise the Governor-General with respect to his recommendations concerning Appropriation Bills, pursuant to Section 56 of the Constitution. And, of course, it is the Government's responsibility also to raise the associated revenue. Given these responsibilities of the Executive, as Minister for Finance, I could not agree to a process whereby the Parliament was able to determine aggregate funding for its own purposes, particularly in the absence of adequate external considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish that Senator Walsh had supported his conviction by voting against his own Party and motions that were supported by his own Party, but he chose instead to commit it to writing when dealing in particular with Appropriations. That letter from Senator Walsh ultimately, and quite properly, provoked a response from the President and from the Speaker. They said to Senator Walsh:</PARA>
<PARA>We wish to take the opportunity to place on record again a very significant point of principle which emerges from the letter. Although the development of the annual budget is at the initiative of the Executive, it is of course a responsibility of both Houses of Parliament to agree to any proposed appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that Senator Walsh seems to overlook. The letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be constitutionally anomalous for the appropriations of the Houses to be determined by the Executive Government which the Houses are supposed to scrutinize and hold accountable. It was for that reason that a separate Appropriation Bill for the Parliamentary Departments was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>That flows from the unanimous recommendations of the Select Committee in 1981 of which members of the present government were then members. Senator Sibraa and Mrs Child said:</PARA>
<PARA>The balance between executive responsibility and the legislature's right to responsible financial independence is a delicate one. You will recall the conclusion reached by the Senate Select Committee on Appropriations and Staffing in 1981 that it is unacceptable for the Parliament to make bids for funds to which the Executive may apply a qualitative judgment and thereby restrict the ability of the legislature to discharge its constitutional duties. </PARA>
<PARA>That, frankly, goes to the very heart of this debate. This debate ought not to be simply and exclusively about the economic policies, economic directions or economic considerations as determined by Senator Walsh and the Government. As the Opposition concedes-of course I agree readily-they ought to be a consideration, but not exclusively. The matter has clearly been the exclusive determination of Senator Walsh. To put it in gentle terms, I find it regrettable that Senator Walsh has chosen, and presumably he reflects the views of the Government, to treat the Parliament and the Senate in particular with the contempt he has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me take the Senate through the history of this year's parliamentary departments bids and appropriations. The bids were received late in July-I think it was the twentieth; it was certainly around that day-which was three weeks late. The Presiding Officers were both overseas attending a presiding officers conference. As the President, Senator Sibraa, has just confirmed, they did not return until 31 July. That was about the time at which the Budget was supposed to be put to bed. It was in fact put to bed early in August.  The bids, when received, sought among other things to overturn a number of savings measures relating to facilities and, if I remember correctly, some construction work in the new Parliament House which had been made and announced 16 months before. I, of course, would not accept them on that basis. I also interpolate here that the rate of expenditure growth, even after one has abstracted the fact that there has been a move into a new and more expensive Parliament House, in the parliamentary departments has been in excess of that of the Public Service generally and in excess of that in just about every other portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the President's statement indicated, consultations will be held at an earlier date next year. The Government and officials will consult on this. There have been more extensive consultations in the past when the bids have been received at a more timely moment and when the Presiding Officers have been in the country. Those consultations will take place and I welcome the likelihood of their starting earlier next year. But the final decisions on the Appropriation Bills that are put to Parliament and on the contents of those Appropriation Bills are made by the Executive. Last night I spelt out the constitutional facts behind that. If the Opposition finds them distasteful, that is not my fault.

<PARA>The amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition to the motion for the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1988-89 clearly sets out the concerns of the people of Australia. This Government seems to have become totally out of touch with what is wanted in the community. Its Ministers have become tired. Their economic policies are now shown to have been a failure. Mr Keating seems to have dropped his bundle with the last month's deficit figures of $1.865 billion. All his predictions about economic recovery have fallen in a great heap. Mr Keating and Senator Walsh in this chamber seem to have come to realise that the matters which the Liberal and National parties have been raising continually about this Government's failure to deal with the fundamental structural problems of this country is bringing about a result such that the people of Australia are now being desperately hurt. </PARA>
<PARA> We have pointed out in this chamber and in the other place repeatedly that since the Hawke Government came to office the pay as you earn taxpayers have been absolutely hounded by this Government to their financial detriment. The Government's own committee has reported to the Government on the nature of the problems being confronted now in particular by the one-income families with children who are trying desperately to cope with the expenses of living in Australia. If people lose their employment their situation is desperate, especially if they are unemployed for a long period. We have pointed out to the people of Australia that by July of next year the tax loss of an ordinary couple with two children will be about $56 a week. In other words, if this Government were to put such people into the tax situation they were in when this Government took office it would have to give them a tax refund of $56 a week. As Senator Walsh has announced on many occasions in this chamber, that is just not possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade agree that the Yugoslav Government should give a full, unconditional and public apology for the shooting of Joseph Tokic, should offer compensation to the wounded boy and should provide complete cooperation with police inquiries, coupled with a waiver of diplomatic immunity, should immunity apply to the person responsible for the shooting? Does he further agree that unless these steps are immediately taken by the Yugoslav Government, the Australian Government should close the Sydney Consulate and expel its staff?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3167" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can advise the Senate what the state of play is on this matter. I think that might be the best way of approaching Senator Chaney's question. The Yugoslav security guard who was involved in Sunday's shooting incident was interviewed at 4 p.m. yesterday by the New South Wales police at the Yugoslav consulate-general and in the presence of the Consul-General. A further interview has been sought for later today at which time the weapon from which the shots were fired will be inspected by the police. This interview process follows advice given by the Yugoslav Ambassador on Monday that his Government had agreed that the person involved in Sunday's shooting incident would be made available for interview by the New South Wales police at the consulate-general and in the presence of the Consul-General, and that the pistol from which the shots were fired would be made available for inspection by the New South Wales police also at the consulate-general and in the presence of the Consul-General. The Ambassador also advised my Department that we could strictly rule out any question of the security guard involved endeavouring to leave Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of immunity which Senator Chaney raised, I repeat the advice which I have already given to the Senate-no question of diplomatic or consular immunity for the security guard concerned has been raised by the Yugoslav authorities with the Government. Our handling of the matter continues to proceed on the basis that no such immunity exists. Perhaps I should say in further clarification of this point that the matter of immunity is determined both by provisions of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and also agreement by both governments as to the level or status of the particular officer at the post concerned. Immunity can be waived by the sending government but it cannot be altered unilaterally by the host government. It is essentially a matter for determination by the courts in accordance with the applicable law as to whether someone enjoys immunity. I repeat: in this case no claim of immunity, diplomatic or consular, has been made. It does not appear, I suppose, likely to be made at this stage, which should avoid at least that complication arising.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did he have the right to remain silent?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has the same right as any other person appearing before the courts, as I would have thought Senator Alston would appreciate as a once-upon-a-time practising lawyer. Accordingly, as I have just said, while there would not appear to be any question arising about personal immunity in this case, at least on the basis of what has been put to us so far, it is the case that the consular premises are themselves, in effect, immune from physical access except with the consent of and on conditions set by the consulate. This has the potential to place obstacles in the way of the law taking its normal course in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ambassador has, in his discussions with departmental deputy secretaries handling this case, offered, as I have previously said publicly, every possible cooperation in resolving this matter. So far that cooperation has been reasonably forthcoming from the Consul-General but there are signs, I have to say, that that willingness is diminishing. The Government is continuing to follow the situation very closely and is considering the available action we can take.</PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind and against that background, the Ambassador was called in this morning to the Department of Foreign Affairs and told the following: first, that if, when the police have completed their interviews and reviewed the available evidence, they determine that there is a basis on which a prosecution should proceed we would expect the Consulate-General to surrender the person concerned to enable the law to take its course and, secondly, if this did not occur, seriously adverse consequences for the bilateral relationship must be expected to follow. We are currently considering all available options in this respect. I would not care to be more precise than that at this stage as to what those available options might be, but they certainly include the option to which Senator Chaney has referred. The Ambassador has said that he would report these two important points to his Government is Belgrade.</PARA>
<PARA> It continues to be a recurring theme of the Yugoslav response to these events that the response of the Australian Protective Service to incidents in the past and to the demonstration on the weekend has been and was less than satisfactory. That is not a charge that we accept. I have received a report from my Department on this matter. I expect that the Ambassador will be called in, either this evening or tomorrow morning-we are still in the process of assembling a little further information, so I cannot be precise about the time-to be presented with a formal note in response to the issues his Government has raised. In this respect, whatever the situation might be with respect to the police presence and involvement at the demonstration, it remains the Government's very strong position that no use of firearms was conceivably justified by anything that occurred on the weekend and our whole course of response has been governed by that.</PARA>
<PARA> I think there was one other aspect of Senator Chaney's question, concerning apology and compensation. As yet that has not been formally pursued by the Australian Government. We are waiting, among other things, for a police report on the incident, a police decision as to the course that they want to follow and a fuller account of the actual circumstances of the shooting. Of course an apology is appropriate, is called for and has not yet been forthcoming. That is one of the things that is not assisting a speedy resolution of this matter. The question of requests or claims for compensation is something that we will certainly address at an appropriate time.</PARA>

I thank the Minister for his very full reply which I think, whilst lengthy, was warranted given the seriousness of the matter that the Minister was addressing. I ask him, firstly, whether he can confirm that what he has told the Senate means that the steps that are being followed can lead in the normal way to a prosecution subject only to the problem of access, which the Minister touched on in his reply. Secondly, can the Minister confirm that the range of measures being considered by the Government include those raised in my question?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Consumer Affairs seen an article in Australian Business which reports the concerns of certain advertising industry associations about changes being made to consumer and community participation in industry self-regulation? What are the Minister's views on the need for public participation in the regulation of this industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3169" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article.  I was particularly concerned about an allegation made in the article that there was a division between the Government and the Trade Practices Commission in respect of this area.  I am somewhat surprised by the article and some of the comments that have been attributed to representatives of the Advertising Federation of Australia Ltd and the Australian Association of National Advertisers.  It is fair to say that for about two years there has been a common need for the self-regulatory system of the advertising industry to be opened up to public and consumer participation.  Even the industry itself has noted in recent days that its current performance is not going all that well.  I quote one particular industry spokesperson:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   Many of the values that advertising agencies continue to purvey on behalf of their clients are yesterday's values.  Many of their morals are yesterday's morals, and many of their methods are yesterday's methods.</PARA>
<PARA>The basic position the Government accepts in this area is that self-regulation of the advertising industry, both in the drawing up of its codes and its complaints structures, is something to be pursued and accepted.  We believe that self-regulation can be flexible and efficient but we also believe it needs to be more credible.  It needs in that process to ensure adequate retention of public confidence and adequate involvement of consumer and community participation. The Trade Practices Tribunal recently noted the need for that sort of concept.</PARA>
<PARA>  The credibility of the Advertising Council in the community is very much an important benchmark.  To achieve and maintain credibility there needs to be effective representation of people who have access to and have the advice and expertise offered by some of the various consumer and community groups.  It is not a radical proposal.  It is one that operates quite extensively overseas. In New Zealand public members are in the majority on the Advertising Standards Council. Europe and Canada also have councils which allow for great public participation in the development of standards.  In the case of Canada there is a system of wide consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe that the attitudes expressed in the Australian Business magazine article by those representatives of the industry are the views of the most responsible members of the advertising industry. Most of them accept the need to greatly improve public participation.  At the same time it should be said that if that is to happen there needs to be greater responsibility shown by consumer and community groups in order that they may be able to make a more responsible and constructive contribution to the development of the code and its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>  In closing, I should say that the Government's view is that industry will respond to the needs for increased participation and will reject this counter productive hostility which appears in articles such as the Australian Business magazine article to which Senator Devereux referred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. In yesterday's answer to a question asked by Senator Hill on 4 November concerning the investigations by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) of Rothwells Ltd, the Minister failed to confirm whether the Western Australian Government's involvement in giving false comfort to small shareholders is being investigated. I ask him to answer that part of the question.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the advertisement. The figures appear to have been taken from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics quarterly review but with some errors in reproduction, understanding or interpretation. It says that wool production was 841 million kilograms, which is the correct figure; and that wool exports sold were also 841 million kilograms, which is not correct. Exports were in fact 919 million kilograms. It says that the average price was 1,003 pence a kilo, which is not correct; the correct figure is cents a kilo. I noticed when the same advertisement was reproduced or republished in another newspaper the error about the unit of currency had been corrected and stated in cents a kilo. It is nice to see that Elders has now moved into the late-1980s time frame. It says that the export revenue was $5.7 billion, which is correct. More importantly, the general thrust of the advertisement appears to be designed to give the casual reader a misleading impression of the extent to which Elders is responsible for the $5.7 billion of export revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last issue of the Australian Business magazine there was a table of Australia's top 500 export earning firms. Elders International Wool Pty Ltd appears in that table in a creditable twenty-third position with 1988 export revenues of $380m.

It seems indeed as if the message that comes out of this company, and particularly out of its chairman, changes from time to time in a way that is designed to appeal to the preferences of the audience.</PARA>

Has the Minister seen documents obtained by American veterans under that country's freedom of information laws which indicate extremely widespread use during the Vietnam war of the previously unreported herbicide known as super orange? Is the Minister aware of communications between military commanders at the time of the conflict which outline methods by which the herbicide could be used extensively in all areas, including built-up areas, while announcing the opposite to placate the fears of, to use their words, the `peasants'? What is the chemical makeup of super orange, where was it used and how much was used?

Mr Humphreys would appreciate it if the honourable senator would make them available to him. He has asked me to advise the honourable senator that, considering that the war in South Vietnam extended over more than 10 years, it is not especially helpful to refer simply to `communications at the time of the conflict'. Senator McLean may have been referring in the second part of his question to policy suggestions made to the United States Chief of Staff in November 1967, but it would help if Senator McLean could be a little more specific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As mentioned in response to the first part of Senator McLean's question, the Minister has not seen the documents and the references to super orange.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the interjections from honourable senators opposite indicate some interest in this general matter, I should say that, as a result of the package of things agreed yesterday morning, 262,000 hectares of Tasmanian forest will now be jointly nominated by the Tasmanian Government and the Commonwealth Government for World Heritage listing. That will bring to 1,031,355 the number of hectares for World Heritage nomination from Tasmania. That in itself is a significant and outstanding achievement by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the question that Senator Devlin has raised: there has been, as Senator Devlin said, some scepticism-one may even say some cynicism-about how the 790,000 additional resource tonnes were calculated, given that in 1985 an environmental impact statement came to a different conclusion. I should point out that the process of assessing available wood resources is a complex and continuing job. It is not an issue that focuses on one time and freezes at that point; it is an ongoing matter. The investigation, in proving up this additional 790,000 tonnes, involved a further thorough analysis, including a review of aerial photography, on-site visits, re-runs of data through computers to check comparisons, comparisons with previous inquiries and records, and scrupulous recalculation of data.</PARA>
<PARA> The final figures were checked by officials of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department in respect of which I share ministerial responsibility with Mr Kerin, and also by officials in Senator Richardson's Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Both groups are satisfied that the extra resource is in fact available. We have nothing to hide on this, and, in order to provide the information that some of the questioners have sought, I now wish to table a document from my Department which goes through the calculations, providing the information and the tonnages at each point.</PARA>

As the NCA obviously has material justifying the investigation for serious crime of these 56 persons, will the Minister confirm that the relevant South Australian Ministers and the South Australian Commissioner of Police have, prior to the granting of these terms of reference, been kept fully informed of the allegations and evidence in support of such allegations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not confirm any particular number of persons as being the subject or targets of the National Crime Authority investigation to be undertaken in South Australia in accordance with the terms of reference which I provided to this chamber yesterday. It is never the case that names, or in this case numbers, of persons the subject of the terms of reference are identified.

<PARA> As to the role of the South Australian Ministers, particularly the Attorney-General-and, of course, the Acting Attorney-General over the last week or so following the sudden illness of Mr Chris Sumner-and the role of the Commissioner of Police, what has to be understood is that, before the National Crime Authority can obtain a reference from the Intergovernmental Committee of Ministers, an assurance has to be given to that intergovernmental committee in accordance with the statute that the South Australian police cannot cope with this particular investigation by using ordinary police methods. That obviously involves an assessment by the Commissioner of Police and advice to his Minister, who then advises the intergovernmental committee of that fact. So there has been quite a deal of assessment of the situation by the Commissioner of Police and the South Australian Ministers; hence their advice to the intergovernmental committee, which was accepted, that ordinary police methods pursued by the South Australian police could not satisfactorily resolve the allegations made in that State of corruption and serious crime.

Therefore, I am unable to say what happened in the interplay between those two entities. Assurances and indications were given by the South Australian Minister at the meeting of the intergovernmental committee and in the Parliament of South Australia about the full cooperation being offered by that Government. I know that Mr Justice Stewart and the members of the Authority, and indeed, the new member, would not want to be in any way circumscribed or hampered, or in any way set up in a sense, whereby they could not undertake the fullest possible investigation by having a circumscribed list and names omitted.

I welcome any interest in the matter, because I think it is important. It is too early to say that this program has been a success, but there are some very encouraging signs in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the tenth annual general meeting of the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), held in Sydney on Friday, 25 November, that organisation, which is the industry association of all the major companies, released its annual data collection on the performance of its member companies. In relation to exports and research and development, the Australian Information Industry Association's members reported exports of information goods and services worth $323m up to 30 June of this year, an increase of 60 per cent on the figures for the previous year. Furthermore, overall investment, including research and development expenditure or investment, was valued at $102m, which is an increase of 26 per cent on figures for the previous year. Member companies are also forecasting a further increase in excess of 13 per cent in the coming financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting, in view of some of the misguided criticisms, that the exports were specifically measured in terms of Australian value-added activity and excluded any re-exporting activities. The Australian Information Industry Association has indicated that the industry is confident that exports will exceed $1.4 billion by 1994. Research and development investment will approach $500m annually by 1994, consistent with the targets established by the Government's information industry strategy which I released in September 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems clear that the industry has taken to heart the main point of the information industry's strategy and its focus on exports, research and development and local value-added activity. It is also clear that the strategy's emphasis on broadening the range of exported goods and services has been taken to heart by the industry, with the AIIA reporting an increase in service exports of over 130 per cent. One is able to say at this time that it is clear that the industry is rising to the challenge of the strategy. This early indication of success is very welcome. The industry does not appear confused about the direction and mechanisms of the Government information industry strategy. That confusion appears to reside elsewhere.</PARA>

Having noted the Minister's reply that it is too early to say that the partnership for development program is a success, does the Minister agree that up to February this year only three agreements had actually been entered into, that other agreements have been entered into since February, and that those agreements can have little or no impact on the export figures to which he has referred?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is, not at all. The process of discussion with various companies about lifting levels of research and development and exports began in mid-1987, as I recall. There was quite a concerted effort from them to get companies to lift their game in this regard. It may be correct that only three major companies had signed partnership agreements as at February this year, but a considerably larger number had been subject to pre-qualified offset status agreements which date back some time, and had been involved in discussion with the Government about the strategy which was to be adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Powell, in her press release, says that because the Democrats believe there is a position they can reach with the Wheat Marketing Board, to protect growers of organic or non-chemical wheat, therefore they will try to scuttle the move to a freer market, a deregulation of wheat marketing in Australia. This is a very interesting press release. It would repay some study by the coalition, because on the one hand she bags the Liberal Party for supporting the free market, and on the other hand she supports the National Party of Australia for supporting protection, and justifies the Democrats position on the basis of organic or non-chemical wheat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, let me answer the rest of Senator Burns's question. The fact that the current regulatory arrangements penalise innovation by growers, such as growing organic or non-chemical wheat, is one of the major reasons for the Government's decision to commercialise the domestic wheat market. But there is no way the current disincentive to innovation can be completely removed without deregulating the market. In short, the Democrats have set themselves an impossible task. They cannot support both the Australian Grain Council's desire for regulation and meet the needs of organic non-chemical growers. At present organic growers, and others like them, are forced to use the grower-to-buyer system. Just by explaining that system I can show how complex and expensive it is.</PARA>
<PARA> Under that system a grower contracts with a buyer-no traders are allowed. They agree on a margin above or below the administered domestic price and wheat is delivered, but the buyer pays the Wheat Board and not the grower for the wheat. The Wheat Board deducts for its pool, the administered domestic price, statutory levies, such as for research, and in most States a charge for the State bulk handling authorities, even though those authorities may not be used. The grower receives the agreed margin, less the statutory and bulk handling charges, plus the normal pool payments; that is, the guaranteed minimum price and any subsequent payments. The problem is that the grower has, in effect, paid for two sets of services not used-the Wheat Board's interest and marketing costs, which are deducted from pool returns based on the calculations of the gross national product and the bulk handling authority charge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition may not like any of this but I am determined to put my view. The Grains Council has suggested removing the bulk handling authority charge, which would improve the system somewhat, but it is only about $5 per tonne. As the Board's pool costs of about $12 per tonne and the restrictions on traders would remain, growers, such as those the Democrats seek to assist, would continue to be penalised. Whenever the Wheat Board has a monopoly on the domestic market and compulsorily acquires all wheat, organic growers and others like them must be penalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a great many growers who want the opportunity to choose who they sell to-41 per cent according to a recent survey. They are all being penalised by the current arrangements. By allowing for freedom of choice, competitive pressures will ensure that there is maximum efficiency in marketing, transport, distribution and handling. That will benefit the growers. I am not surprised that most of the chortling comes from the National Party while the Liberal Party remains quiet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware of the quote attributed to the chairman of the Appeal Board, nor did I know that the Montessori application for a school had been rejected and was being appealed against. I am aware of the basis of the Commonwealth's policy for receiving applications for either new funding for schools or expanded funding, and that is principally the basis of need for additional capacity. I think it is generally agreed that it would be a waste of resources if additional private schools were to be built in an area where either the school population was declining or there was already more than enough capacity within the government system and perhaps some of the private school systems to provide for the population in that area. The need for capacity is the basic determinant of the Commonwealth policy and applications are graded into four different categories, and I believe that they are published. It really does not have anything to do with the preference for a public or private education system of anybody who sits on an appeal board because the criteria for selection into either the high, medium, low and very low categories-I think that is what they are called-are more objective than subjective judgments about whether the public or the private school system is preferable. I will refer that question to the Minister to see whether he has anything to add to what I have said.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand there are approximately 1,000 injuries a day and 550 deaths each year in Australian work places. Even allowing for 20 per cent of those deaths being due to accidents travelling to and from work, the figures are still terribly high and the cost to the economy is estimated at $6.5 billion a year. I note that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has identified six priority areas and is working towards the development of preventive strategies for these areas. I ask the Minister whether this action will be adequate to achieve a reduction in the unacceptably high level of occupational injury and death. Is there a need to target accident prevention and safety promotion as a priority?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Crowley says in her question is true-Australia has an unacceptably high incidence of work-related death and injury. In industry, particularly, it affects productivity and it is unfortunate for those employees concerned. The Commonwealth holds responsibilities for areas under Commonwealth jurisdiction in this matter, including its own employees, but responsibility for occupational health and safety falls primarily under the jurisdiction of State and Territory governments. Each State and Territory has now introduced and administers legislation in the area which has been or is now being reviewed in most States. It was in an attempt to reverse the situation described in Senator Crowley's question and to bring about a concerted national approach to prevention that the Government established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, which has made significant progress towards developing a national strategy in consultation with the States and other bodies. A major priority has been the development of national uniform data. There have been other studies on work-related fatalities and the Commission is also in the process of developing a wide range of national standards and codes of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of duplication of effort is one of the reasons why the Commission made a decision to identify and develop preventive strategies to address the six priority areas referred to by Senator Crowley. These priority areas, which we frequently hear about, are back problems, hearing loss, skin disorders, chemical management, mechanical equipment injury and occupational cancer. In light of Senator Crowley's concern, which has been reflected in questions in the Senate on a number of occasions, there is a concern that these priorities may not adequately cover the problems faced by Australian employees. I will pursue the question with the Minister for Industrial Relations, including the possibility that this be taken up further in the relevant Commonwealth-State Ministers forum, and I will ask the Minister to inform Senator Crowley of progress in those discussions as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter is very important to Senator Chaney's shadow portfolio, so I assume he will be interested. The answer is that an international depository authority under the Budapest Treaty was established in Australia, to operate from 30 September 1988. In Australia, as in many other countries, deposit of a micro-organism in such an authority is required in certain cases. The role of the authority has been taken on by the New South Wales regional laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, located in Pymble. This body has received a number of inquiries since it took on its status as a depository authority, but it has not yet received any deposits under the Treaty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether the material originates in Australia or elsewhere, the usual requirements for import permits for micro-organisms will apply to deposits under the Treaty. Patents for micro-organisms have been granted in Australia and overseas countries for a number of years. The Patents Office does not keep separate figures which provide a breakdown of the number of applications for micro-organisms, but the total number of applications in the field is about 2,000. About 400 applications are lodged each year. So far there have been about a dozen patent applications concerning genetically engineered animals. Of the six which have reached the stage of being open to public inspection, two are from Australia, one is from the United Kingdom, two are from the United States of America, and one is from the Federal Republic of Germany. None of the applications for animals has been examined. The length of the term for all standard patents granted in Australia is 16 years and there is no exception here to that. The usual requirements of the Patents Act apply to applications for patents for animals. There is further information. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard, as it is more detailed.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>An international depositary authority under the Budapest Treaty was established in Australia with effect from 30 September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>in Australia, and many other countries, deposit of a microorganism in such a depositary authority is required in certain cases. Deposit in Australia then satisfies part of the general requirement that the invention be fully described in a patent specification.</PARA>
<PARA>the role of an authority has been taken on by the NSW regional laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) located at 1 Suakin Street, Pymble, NSW. AGAL falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA>the establishment of AGAL as a depositary authority was announced on 7 September 1988 in a joint media statement by the Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. The Patent Office also informed interest groups direct, and published notices in its official journal.</PARA>
<PARA>an Australian depositary authority will assist Australia's biotechnology industry by providing ready access to microorganisms deposited in Australia under the Treaty, it will help local inventors obtain patents, here and overseas, for inventions involving microorganisms.</PARA>
<PARA>AGAL has received a number of inquiries since it took on status as a depositary authority, but has not yet received any deposits under the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>in its new capacity, AGAL will accept deposits of bacteria (including actinomycetes), yeasts and fungi (other than known human and animal pathogens) that can be preserved without significant change to their properties by the methods of preservation in use by AGAL (currently freezing and freeze drying). AGAL will not at this time accept for deposit animal, plant, algal and protozoal cultures, cultures of viral, rickettsial and chlamydial agents, microorganisms prohibited by Australian law, or fastidious microorganisms which may require, in the view of the curator, special attention to handling and preparation for storage. This means that no new arrangements are required to contain deposits of material which AGAL will accept under the Budapest Treaty, whether the material originates in Australia or elsewhere. The usual requirements for import permits for microorganisms will apply to deposits under the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>the Treaty allows a depositary authority not to accept microorganisms which it cannot properly contain and preserve or which might not be welcome for reasons of national security or dangers to health or the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>patents for microorganisms have been granted in Australia and in overseas countries for a number of years (in Australia since 1976).</PARA>
<PARA>the Patent Office does not keep figures which provide a breakdown of the number of applications for microorganisms themselves as distinct from applications involving the use of microorganisms. The total number of applications in the field is about 2000. At present, about 400 applications are lodged each year. These figures include applications for, or involving the use of, microorganisms, cell lines, viruses, yeasts, protozoas and fungi.</PARA>
<PARA>There have so far been about a dozen patent applications concerning genetically engineered animals, including cases where only a provisional specification has been lodged. Of the 6 applications which have reached the stage of being open to the public inspection, 2 applicants are from Australia, 1 from the United Kingdom, 2 from the United States and 1 from the Federal Republic of Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>These applications concern a variety of uses of farm animals or methods of producing them. They cover:</PARA>
<PARA> Production of an animal by introducing DNA using sperm as the carrier;</PARA>
<PARA> Harvesting useful proteins from the milk of the animal;</PARA>
<PARA> A method of cloning cattle;</PARA>
<PARA> A method of changing the physical characteristics of an animal; and</PARA>
<PARA> A larger animal with better meat quality.</PARA>
<PARA> None of the applications for animals has yet been examined. Patents are unlikely to be granted in the next 18 months to 2 years assuming that the applications proceed along a normal path.</PARA>
<PARA> The length of term for all standard patents granted in Australia is 16 years. There is no difference in term between patents for biological and other inventions.</PARA>
<PARA> Progeny which fall within the scope of a patent's claims-that is, which have the essential characteristics of the patented strain-would prima facie be covered by the patent. They may not, however, be an infringement of the patent, depending on the circumstances. The Patents Act contains no provisions expressly dealing with the issue, so the position would depend on the terms under which breeding stock was sold by the patentee. In the absence of any case law which might invoke some kind of implied licence to breed progeny, both buyer and seller of breeding stock would be well advised to ensure that the terms of sale were clear on this point.</PARA>
<PARA> The usual requirements of the Patents Act apply to applications for patents for animals. There are no special requirements. Although a patent has not yet been granted in Australia for an animal, the Commissioner of Patents has informed me that the Patent Office would not refuse a patent for a new and non-human animal variety, provided the invention satisfied all the usual requirements of the Patents Act. Of course, the validity of a patent can only be finally determined by the courts.</PARA>
<PARA> The obligation to make a deposit only applies to microorganism inventions in certain circumstances. The Government has no plans to impose a deposit requirement in the case of animal patents generally, but if such a need were indeed to emerge it would be considered carefully.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would observe that it would be a mistake if moral and ethical problems about animal experimentation and genetic engineering were to become focused upon the patent system when wider issues are involved. I wish to make a few observations about the patent system in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> The main idea of the patent system is to offer encouragement to inventors, entrepreneurs and investors to make new advances in technology and to bring new products into the open and onto the market. The High Court has held that inventions which belong to the useful arts and have some economic significance are generally capable of patent protection. Patent law therefore has some inherent flexibility to cope with changing technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The law in general has always recognised that people can legitimately own and breed animals. It is consistent for patent law to permit a patent of an animal variety possessing new characteristics produced by the inventor.</PARA>
<PARA> Animal experimentation and genetic manipulation can take place whether or not patents are available. The patent system is and should be neutral on any ethical issues involved in such experiments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Patent Office would refuse any patent application for a human being.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time yesterday Senator Chapman asked me a number of questions about the Child Support Agency (CSA) scheme. I have some supplementary answers to those questions. He firstly asked about so-called `lengthy delays that are being incurred in the collection and transfer of child maintenance payments as a result of a changeover from current collections agencies to the Child Support Agency scheme'. The answer is: there are no such delays because no changeovers from current State agencies are occurring. Apart from a small number of transfers in the Australian Capital Territory, no cases have been transferred from State agencies. They have not been transferred for two reasons: firstly, this transfer requires the agreement of the States and no State has as yet signed the agreement required. In this context the Government has been concerned to ensure that the sorts of problems that Senator Chapman mentioned will not occur where cases are transferred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Chapman asked about `a time lag of some six weeks between the time maintenance payments are made to the Australian Taxation Office and the time that the beneficiary actually receives those payments from the Department of Social Security'. He also made some reference to his State of South Australia and said that this time lag may be `stretched to some eight to 10 weeks'. The answer to this question is no, once again for two reasons: firstly, there is no such delay and, secondly, the delay there is between the due date for payment to the child support agency and the date of payment to the custodial parent is not because of interdepartmental bureaucracy or any other form of bureaucracy. The due date for payment to the CSA is specifically prescribed by the Child Support Act and is exactly the same due date as pay as you earn payments so as to ensure the simplicity of the system. The date for payments to custodial parents, similarly, is precisely defined by section 6 of the Child Support Act. It is inaccurate, therefore, to attribute the gap to interdepartmental bureaucracy, especially when the legislation, which is clear and precise on this point, was supported by all parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The third question Senator Chapman asked was:</PARA>
<PARA>What does the Government intend to do about this problem in order to avoid undue hardship being placed upon those families in need, most especially during the festive season?</PARA>
<PARA>The quick answer is: firstly, no transfers from State agencies will occur prior to Christmas so no problems will arise in the festive season and, secondly, the Child Support Agency, the Department of Social Security and the Minister for Social Security are working to ensure that the Child Support Agency extends its coverage and that the changeover to the monthly collection cycle does not disadvantage those people lucky enough to be receiving maintenance payments on a more regular basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Vallentine asked me a question about the spent fuel cask which would be used to transship material from Lucas Heights, ultimately to the United States of America. In particular, she asked me about the transfer cask which is to take that spent fuel for reprocessing and, in a supplementary question, about the fuel baskets which will hold the spent fuel rods inside the cask and about the handling trials conducted by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate that the honourable senator and a number of other people have a peculiar interest in this subject. The implication of all these questions is that the Government will be deliberately shipping the spent fuel in an unsafe manner, and this is preposterous. The cask will be used for several shipments and ANSTO, probably more than anyone else, must be reassured that all possible safety aspects have been covered. I repeat that this operation is safe and is conducted routinely worldwide under the relevant transport regulations, despite assertions to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the supplementary question regarding the welds is yes. The welds on the fuel baskets were inspected on arrival in Australia by ANSTO testing and inspection engineers to ensure that they conformed to the design specifications and they were found to be satisfactory. One nut was noted to be spot-welded in accordance with the original design, although the others were fillet-welded. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission had requested that these nuts be fillet-welded to give additional security and this modification was carried out on the remaining nut. This request was not related to the structural integrity of the baskets or the cask.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the question related to the handling trials that ANSTO is conducting. I believe that my previous answer to this was sufficient. However, to be more specific, the trials consist of testing all seals for vacuum sealing and performing all procedures associated with loading the cask with the spent fuel, such as lifting it in and out of the pond which contains the baskets of spent fuel, loading and unloading the cask under water with empty baskets, and ensuring that all staff are fully familiar with these procedures. These trials will be fully assessed prior to actually loading the cask with the spent fuel and will be witnessed by a Department of Transport and Communications engineer.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme has been much in the news lately, as honourable senators would be only too well aware. Of particular interest today are some statistics which are included in this report from the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and I draw the attention of the Senate to them. First of all, the numbers of servicemen who left the defence forces in the last financial year without any entitlement to pensions are as follows: in 1986-87, 448 officers left without entitlement to ongoing benefits. In 1987-88 that figure grew to 503 officers. In 1986-87 there were 2,184 people in other ranks who were discharged at their own request, and last year the figure was 2,546. It is a matter of serious concern when servicemen are prepared to leave without waiting for the entitlements for which they have been compulsorily paying 5.5 per cent of their salary over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other piece of information in this report that I found of particular interest is the concern which was expressed by the Authority at the growing number of new invalidity cases which are coming before it each year. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1986-87 Annual Report of the Authority reported concern as to the workload implications of a significant increase in the number of new invalidity cases received during 1986-87. The trend in increased numbers of invalidity cases received continued in to 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority states that, if this continues for the next year, it will have very real problems, with a lack of resources to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Something which I am also particularly worried about is the growing number of members who have been discharged on invalidity grounds within one year of entering the defence forces whereas the condition that caused their retirement existed before their entry into the forces. This year, for the first time, that figure exceeded the number of other invalidity retirements. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this say for recruiting standards? I have been very concerned about those for some time. In fact, I have raised this matter in the past at Estimates committee hearings but officers have denied that there is a problem, although I believe that servicemen have been recruited into the Army with bands on their teeth, with flat feet and with asthma, all of which have been declared to the Services; yet they have been recruited. It is no wonder that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) is on the record as having told us on a number of occasions that she is having no trouble recruiting into the defence forces. Of course, she needs to recruit desperately in order to fill the gaps created by those who are leaving. I am concerned that here is the evidence as to what is happening. We are recruiting people who are not fit for the services. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been recent legislative amendments to the DFRDB legislation, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy President, but there is also an ongoing review into the anomalies of various classes of orphans-with no parent or one parent. That is yet to be sorted out and it is taking some time. Even more important are the amendments that are required to the basis of the scheme. It seems to be the worst superannuation scheme in Australia. Servicemen have to put 5.5 per cent of their income each fortnight into the scheme but get no return whatsoever by way of interest if they do not wait 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme has been criticised roundly in the recent Cross report on wastage rates in the Defence Force. It was also criticised strongly in an article entitled `Defence Force Super-It's a Scandal' in the Australian Investment magazine. There has been some publicity about the matter, but the Government has chosen not to take any action. In fact, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has said that to do anything to the scheme would have a bad effect on morale. Senator Walsh also has had a bad effect on morale by telling us that `the 2 per cent discount in the DFRDB scheme does not affect conditions of service in the Defence Force because, by definition, it affects only people who have retired from the Defence Force'. When we have Ministers in this Government who are not prepared to do something to improve the DFRDB scheme for our servicemen, it is no wonder that we are having appalling losses from our Services. Those losses will go on until such time as this Government is seen to care about the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government talks about deregulation, about opening up government business enterprises to competition. The Department of Transport and Communications, on page 33 of its report, makes reference to that. The report talks about what has happened elsewhere in the world other than in Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Increased competition was seen as being able to improve service quality and reduce costs, rather than increasing costs through duplication. The continued self-regulation of telecommunications monopolies was being challenged as inappropriate to what are increasingly commercial undertakings . . . the need to subject the market power of telecommunications providers to the full rigours of competition policy and restrictive business practices legislation was being raised. </PARA>
<PARA>It then says that similar questions were being asked in Australia. What, in fact, has this Government done? It has prevented competition. It has introduced regulations which exempt Telecom Australia from certain provisions of the Trade Practices Act. So, instead of deregulating and providing competition, the Government has simply changed the locks on the door. It is re-regulating the industry and giving Telecom the opportunity to dominate this market in relation to a lot of value-added services. By the time the various markets are opened up to competition, it may well be too late for real competitors to emerge because Telecom will have locked up the main users of some of the services and will have joint ventures with other users of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that it is setting up a separate regulatory body to monitor Telecom, which will be known as Austel. In fact, the report at page 7 shows Austel as a portfolio agency as though it were already in existence, although it is talking about the new program for 1988-89. The truth of the matter is that Austel does not exist. Enabling legislation has not been introduced, and Austel will not exist until, at the earliest, the second half of next year. That is what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) has predicted, if ever it does come into existence. Knowing the trouble this Government's departments have in drawing up legislation, one wonders when this legislation will make the floor of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, Telecom has been given a totally free hand. This Government is paying lip service to competition, talking about micro-economic reform agendas and all that sort of thing. At the same time, it has excluded the Trade Practices Act in relation to certain areas of Telecom, giving Telecom an opportunity to move into a dominant position in all areas of the market and to ensure that competition has no real chance of getting started. As I said, all the Government is doing is talking about micro-economic reform while it goes ahead changing the lock on the door so as to ensure that Telecom will dominate this market forever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications is an important one. In the short time available to debate this report one can pick out only some of the important issues. I will concentrate my remarks today on chapter 2, which relates to broadcasting policy. I highlight one of the issues that has recently been drawn to the attention of members of Parliament by virtue of a delegation from a group known as Television-Make it Australian. It addresses the question of Australian content in broadcasting, specifically in television broadcasting. It is important that it be drawn to the attention of the Government that here is an opportunity for a government which has presided over the monopolisation in the hands of media magnates of our television medium, and of the media in general to a vast extent in recent years, to show its bona fides in the interests of the community as a whole and to meet the request of the consolidated group of people involved in the production and development of Australian drama that we increase the Australian content levels in our television programming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having turned the television industry over into the hands of just three business tycoons, the very least the Government can do is listen to these pleas. As the Television-Make it Australian group says, `unless we are careful Australia could become the fifty-first state of America'. We should contrast what we do here in Australia with what is done overseas, bearing in mind that our few television network owners are pushing for deregulation in this area. As it is, our requirements are currently quite low. One hundred and four hours of Australian drama is all that is required. That requirement has not changed for 12 years, so we need some advances in this area. Especially given the fact that the television network owners are increasingly getting international links with production and distribution houses overseas, it is extremely likely-in fact it is a foregone conclusion-that if deregulation were to take place we would get more overseas products and fewer Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian content requirement is 104 hours. Now Television-Make it Australian wants that requirement substantially raised to 365 hours a year, or one hour a day, over a three-year period. In contrast, in England 87 per cent of drama content is English and in the United States of America, 98 per cent of drama content is American, so it is clear where their loyalties lie. I stress that it is cultural loyalties that we are talking about. It is clear where their loyalties lie, but it is not so clear where our loyalties lie. Of course, television network owners or their lobbyists will cry poor, as they have to me. They will say that they cannot afford it, that it is too expensive. We are supposed to feel sympathetic with them-the people who have paid outrageous prices for a very powerful market niche in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a futile push: the ratings picture for Australian mini-series shows that over the past decade in Sydney they have rated at 29 against 21 for imported mini-series; in Melbourne the figure is 32 as against 21; in Brisbane, 25 as against 19; in Adelaide, 27 to 21; and in Perth, 34 to 26. Clearly, these are saleable products. They are also saleable on the international scene. I thought it was interesting that in a press report this morning following the press conference of Television-Make It Australian yesterday Terry Donovan expressed some lack of comprehension as to why the series Neighbours should be selling so well in the United Kingdom, especially as his son is one of the stars. Nevertheless, these products do sell overseas. We must take a more conscientious approach. We must get out of the cultural cringe that we are in lest our media magnates sell us off to the international interests and lest our culture become more and more hidden behind the cultures of other nations. This is a challenge. The patrons of Television-Make it Australian-Hector Crawford, David Williamson, Susan Ryan, Donald Horne and Jim McClelland-represent a broad cross-section of people who care about the culture of Australia. Certainly I and the Australian Democrats endorse their push and call on the Government to show its bona fides in the interests of the Australian community and to back this attempt to bring Australian culture onto Australian screens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly to one or two matters in the annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications. One aspect of this lengthy report is headed `A new approach to roads involvement', which is attributed to the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Road Efficiency Branch. It seems to me and most people in this country that the new approach to roads involvement is to starve roads of funds. I have to smile when I see the final sentence of that section, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The new Federal roads package will accelerate structural adjustment with long-term benefits for the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>One has only to read transport magazines, talk to local government or listen to State governments to know that the position of roads, long-term, in Australia is in dire straits because of underfunding. Under the heading `Current programs', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Total Federal funding for roads was maintained at $1250m. This represents about one-third of annual road expenditure by all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. In fact, local government spends $300m more on roads than any other sphere of government in Australia. The author of the article stated that detailed consultations were held with Federal and State governments and industry organisations, local government and other interested groups. Quite naturally, the two issues on which there was most discussion and lobbying with those consulted were the level of funding and impossible absorption of funding. The level of funding occupies State and local governments at the moment. They have been lobbying me and other members of the coalition for some time. They are particularly concerned that this so-called new approach to roads involvement will bankrupt the roads system. One of our greatest national assets is being drained of funds. Frankly, the whole situation is in a real mess. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a small portion of the report which is important to me. Under subprogram 5.1: Maritime Policy is the heading `Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme'. I know that over the years all governments have supported the scheme because of the need to supply Tasmania with what I suppose one could call part of the national highway. The part that interests me reads:</PARA>
<PARA>During 1987-88 payments to claimants amounted to $28m ($24.85m under the north-bound component of the scheme . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This means that Tasmanian businesses are exporting quite a deal of their products using this scheme. Not long ago I accompanied some of my colleagues in talking to businesses in the north of the State. It was very obvious to us that if the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme had not been in existence a lot of those businesses would have gone under or would have had to move to mainland Australia. I draw the attention of the Senate to that section of the report which deals with a very important matter to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to touch on briefly is the section on Tasrail operations. I congratulate the Government on agreeing to continue to support the rail operations in Tasmania for a further five years. All Tasmanians have no doubt that since Tasrail came into existence it has been very efficient. It is keeping trucks off the roads: they are not clogged up with log trucks. Tasrail is responsible for moving a lot of cargo in Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In rising to speak on this annual report of the Health Insurance Commission 1987-88 I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the goal of Medibank Private as stated on page 11 of the report-`To act in a manner which will enhance the image and ethical behaviour of the health insurance industry'-and in doing so, comment on the experiences of a constituent of mine in dealing with Medibank Private. In February of this year, my constituent, who had handled all the dealings with Medibank Private for her family, renewed her private health insurance for six months. Subsequently, her husband left her and her three children. Proceedings were undertaken in the Family Court of Australia to determine finally the financial relationship between the parents. The custody of the children, including the day-to-day care, was awarded to the wife. Sealed orders of the Family Court were issued at the end of June 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent approached Medibank Private, explained her circumstances and queried whether she could transfer the health insurance for herself and the children to her name. She was told that this was not possible until the present cover expired at the end of August. When she received the renewal notice for the insurance she approached Medibank Private once again and was told to submit a membership application and subscription payment for herself and her children. She was subsequently contacted by Medibank Private head office and told that the children could not be transferred as her dependants because the expiring policy was in her husband's name and the children therefore were classified as his dependants, not hers. She could, however, take out cover for herself as a single contributor. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent inquired as to what she needed to do to have the children's membership transferred. She was told that she would need to obtain a letter from her estranged husband agreeing to have the children removed from his membership to hers. My constituent explained that relations between herself and her husband were such that she did not expect his cooperation; nonetheless she was prepared to ask. However, she pointed out that she had sealed orders of the Family Court of Australia which quite clearly stated that she was the custodial parent of the children in question and asked whether these were acceptable proof that the children were her dependants. Much to her surprise and, I will say to the Senate, to mine also, she was informed that these would not do. My constituent reiterated to the Medibank private staff member that these were sealed orders of the Family Court and asked how they could not possibly be acceptable as proof of her children's status as her dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff member undertook to speak to the supervisor and returned to the telephone with the message, `We don't want to be accused of breaking up families'. My constituent then pointed out that the family had already broken up, which was the very reason for the existence of the Family Court orders. </PARA>
<PARA> She was then told that, via an administrative loophole, it was possible that if her husband did not renew his insurance and it then lapsed the children would, after the two months period of grace for renewal, be able to be transferred retrospectively to her membership which would then change from single to family. My constituent did approach her husband for a statement about the children's dependency but, as she had predicted, it was not forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of October the children finally were transferred to her membership. But what would the situation have been had one of her three children needed hospital treatment during the two-month hiatus? They were not covered on their mother's insurance and clearly their father was neither interested nor concerned to make sure that their cover continued, as he did not renew his own. The effluxion of time has solved this constituent's problem, but how many others have had the same runaround? How many other parents of dependent children have faced the situation of their children being uninsured? In terms of Medibank Private's goal, which I stated at the outset, I cannot imagine how its image is enhanced by refusing to acknowledge proper legal documents issued and sealed by the Family Court of Australia. I would ask that the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), take note of this issue and inform the Senate of what action the Government proposes to take in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The annual report of the Health Insurance Commission is a glossy document, with nice photographs of staff on the front and detailed statistics inside. I wish to refer the Senate to the issue of Medicare funding for abortions. The Health Insurance Commission is the body which deals with Medicare. I draw the attention of the Senate to the tragic fact that in the last year for which figures are available, 1987-88, the number of Medicare-subsidised abortions reached an all time high of 61,879. The Federal Government's direct pay-out for Medicare-funded abortions amounted to $6.4m in 1987-88. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document showing abortion statistics which were derived from the Department of Community Services and Health and also the South Australian figures from the Cox report, tabulated by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ABORTION STATISTICS</PARA>
<PARA>1. Abortion figures released in November 1988 by the Department of Community Services and Health had the following significant features:</PARA>
<PARA> The total number of Medicare subsidised abortions has increased from 61,773 in 1986-87 to 61,879 in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government payout for Medicare-funded abortions amounted to $6.4 million in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of late-term Medicare-funded abortions increased from 558 in 1986-87 to 674 in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA>2. New South Wales performed the lion's share of Medicare-subsidised abortions during 1987-88: 30,748. A total of 16,364 Medicare-subsidised abortions were performed in Victoria, while Queensland recorded a total of 5,676, an increase of 575 over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>3. These figures do not represent total abortions. They do not include the substantial number of abortions which are performed in public hospitals on public patients. The cost of these abortions is absorbed within the hospital's general budget, and, therefore, there are no figures on the number of such abortions, nor the cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>4. In South Australia, however, ALL abortions must be reported. In 1987-88, a total of 1,568 abortions in South Australia attracted Medicare benefits. BUT THE REPORTED NUMBER OF ABORTIONS FOR 1986 WAS 4,323. Thus, the number of actual abortions performed in South Australia is THREE TIMES the number derived from Medicare records. </PARA>
<PARA>5. If we assume that the Medicare abortion statistics are understating the actual number of abortions by only 25%, then the total number of abortions in Australia must be at least 80,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Given that there were 243,000 live births in 1987-88, there is now one abortion for every three live births in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The South Australian figures from the Cox Report (17th Annual Report, 1987) reveal the reasons stated for abortions in the year 1986 as follows: Rape, 0 cases; Specified Medical Disorder, 0.5%; Damage to foetus (eugenic), 1.5%; Specified Psychological Disorder, 98%. </PARA>
<PARA>8. The abortion statistics indicate that Sydney, with its lucrative private abortion centres, is the abortion capital of Australia. Some of these centres tout for business in Queensland and the ACT. DCS&amp;H figures show that, while claims were made under item 6469 for abortions performed on 8,600 Qld residents, 5,573 were performed in that State. Similarly, while claims were made under item 6469 for abortions on 1,375 ACT residents, 117 were performed in the ACT. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It is important to indicate that these figures do not represent the total number of abortions. They do not include the substantial number of abortions performed in public hospitals on public patients. The cost of these abortions is absorbed within the hospitals' general budgets. Therefore, there are no figures on the number of such abortions, nor on their cost to the taxpayer. Although there are no publicly available figures, I believe that they should be available. In South Australia all abortions must be reported. In 1987-88, a total of 1,568 abortions in South Australia attracted Medicare benefits. But the reported number of abortions for 1986 was over three times that number-doing a quick calculation, 4,323. Thus the actual number of abortions performed in South Australia is three times the number derived from Medicare records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not suggest that that ought to be transposed to the rest of Australia, because of certain factors which I do not have time to go through now. But I think it is fair to add, conservatively, 25 per cent to the figure of 61,879, which gives a tragic figure of 80,000 deliberate abortions performed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note these statistics, to reflect on them and to consider what action needs to be taken to ensure that this tragedy does not continue. Australia Health, the first biannual report of the Australian Institute of Health, talks about-for the first time in a public document-`easier access to abortion as a method of birth limitation'. We have reached an all time low as a civilised society if we deliberately take human life purely for convenience. That would be the case if, as suggested by that official report of the Australian Institute of Health, there were easier access to abortion as a means of birth limitation. I believe that it behoves all members of the Senate, all members of the Parliament, all thinking individuals, to consider the implications of these figures and to take action to end this tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report of the innovative agricultural marketing program, administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, is certainly a well presented document and makes interesting reading. It is clear when one looks at the diversity of companies and institutions which have received grants, that the agricultural base of Australia is becoming more exotic. It was Sir Thomas Brisbane, an early Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, who brought flax from New Zealand and cotton and tobacco from Virginia to plant and propagate in Australia. Brisbane's efforts met with little success, probably because of the rudimentary ground preparations of the time. Nevertheless he established a significant element in Australian primary industry-the willingness to try out new and exotic processes and new crops. </PARA>
<PARA> On reading the report I am a little disappointed to only find two grantees from my State of Tasmania. The first was Agrimark Tasmania, from New Norfolk, which received $25,000 to undertake an economic viability study on the Tasmanian berry fruit industry. </PARA>

<PARA> The second was the Tasmanian Agricultural Department and Australian Hop Marketers Pty Ltd who received $13,000 for their work towards an aroma hop export market. I hope that more Tasmanian agricultural entrepreneurs will apply to the program in the future because Tasmania certainly has never lacked innovation and flair in the rural field. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the world famous opium poppy industry in Tasmania, which is, I believe, policed as the most secure such system there is. Senators, especially those with an interest in primary production, will also know of the world records set each year by Tasmanian superfine merino wool growers. What is probably not realised is that it was a Tasmanian, and a great Australian, the late Lyell Stuart, OBE, who developed the first indigenous Australian breed of sheep-the Poll Dorset-and that the Elliotdale sheep was specifically developed in Tasmania for carpet wool and has achieved great success. </PARA>
<PARA> Other innovative Tasmanian rural industries are the increasingly diverse berry fruit industry which was assisted under this program, and the associated essential oils project being developed by the University of Tasmania with assistance from the Tasmanian Development Authority. Essential Oils for perfume such as fennel, boronia, peppermint and lavender are now being exported to Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> A new cut flower establishment called `Blooms' was opened by the Tasmanian Premier last week at Christmas Hills near Devonport and will serve all eastern Australian States and some overseas markets. On the beautiful Table Cape in north-west Tasmania, Mr Paul Roberts-Thomson has ambitiously gone ahead with a tulip growing program, and it seems that Tasmanian tulips could well be being sent to Holland for winter retail sales-truly a case of coals to Newcastle!</PARA>
<PARA> The King Island dairy industry has become very well known nation-wide in the last few years. King Island brie and Camembert are now sought after and King Island cream is served at the best restaurants in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these points about the innovation and flourishing activity on the Tasmanian rural scheme lest anyone believe that Tasmania is lagging behind on the reading of this report. In closing, it is worth reminding the Senate of the imminence of the European Community's plan for a free intra-europe market after 1992 and the consequent effect that this will have on the primary and resource economy of Australia. During her visit earlier this year, Mrs Margaret Thatcher said:</PARA>
<PARA> `Britain can provide a springboard for Australia into that market and we hope that our trade and investment will help us to do better in the great market of the Pacific . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Given the statistic that each Australian farmer loses about $10,000 a year as a direct result of the agricultural policies of the EEC, I earnestly hope that the British Prime Minister is right and that the European Market will play fair and give countries such as Australia the opportunity to trade and compete, especially in relation to primary industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which carried out most of the inquiry into the potential of the Kakadu National Park region, I would have liked to take the brief time available to me today to comment on the majority report which, I believe, has a range of recommendations which are appropriate to the significance of the Kakadu region to all Australians and, indeed, in the sense that a large section of it is now a World Heritage area, its significance to the world. But, as the only Government senator of the two members who served on both committees, I believe that I have a responsibility to set the record straight by examining some of the substance and recommendations of the dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since two of the three Opposition members of the present Committee have taken little part in the inquiry or the subsequent discussion of the report-they were late arrivals to it-I believe Senator Crichton-Browne to be the chief author of that dissent. What puzzles me is that the content of the dissent and even its rhetoric have very strong echoes of the material presented to us during the inquiry by the mining lobby, in particular by the representatives of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines. Yet the signatories to the dissent have attacked environmentalists and conservationists who they claim have a vested interest in the future of Kakadu. Sure, some of us may be said to have a vested interest in maintaining a unique part of our heritage for future generations, but surely the vested interests of the mining industry, of a more short term and self-interested nature, must also be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, at several points in the dissenting report there are references to the alleged lack of `intellectual rigour' and/or integrity or accusations of philosophical prejudice on the part of those inside or outside the Committee whose views differ from those of Senators Crichton-Browne, Panizza and McGauran. These claims, however, are nowhere supported with intellectual rigour. Many of their arguments are based on their perceptions of the views of environmentalists and/or Government members of the Committee, rather than on the opinions themselves as expressed in the submissions or in the majority report. For example, there is an assumption that, because we are concerned with the potential damage from mining, we do not recognise potential damage from tourism. An example of this occurs in their dissent relating to visitors' fees, where it is claimed that the majority believes that present park facilities are adequate, when our recommendation clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA>The fees levied should be related to the provision, improvement and maintenance of services and facilities in the park. </PARA>
<PARA>The dissenters, who claim lack of integrity on the part of those opposed to them, had no qualms about attempting to discredit the appointment of Ms Lyn Allen to the Coordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region. The dissenting report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We can think of no justification for having Ms L. Allen as a member other than for blatant Party politicking. </PARA>
<PARA>The same Ms Allen has a bachelor of science degree in chemistry and zoology, an honours degree in environmental studies and three years experience in environmental monitoring-working for the mining industry, incidentally-prior to becoming Coordinator of the Northern Territory Environmental Centre. I would have thought this was just the sort of technical competence that the dissenters say is needed on that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissenting report claims that a large area of land has been `indiscriminately' set aside for inclusion in the World Heritage listing. Clearly, the writer or writers did not follow the lengthy and thorough preparation which occurred in applying for listing or even the heated debate in this chamber at the time. I am sure that Senator Crichton-Browne, as I do, remembers that clearly. It is the international body, however, that made the decision on the basis of the evidence put to it. So, is the minority claiming that the international body has acted indiscriminately?</PARA>
<PARA> In the debate of the week before last, several senators referred to the size of Kakadu National Park. Again this was a recurrent theme in the submissions of the mining companies. The size of the park, whether in terms of square kilometres or relative to areas in other parts of Australia, is really irrelevant. What is relevant is the integrity of the World Heritage wetlands in stages 1 and 2 of the park. They are dependent on rivers flowing from and through stage 3. The purity, both chemically and in terms of sedimentation, of the river system-in particular the South Alligator River, which flows through the conservation zone at the foot of Coronation Hill and close to the other areas where exploration is taking place-is vital to the abundant and unique life of the wetlands. I cannot agree with the claim by the dissenters that Australia's reputation did not suffer by the excision of the uranium mining zones from the park. I remind the Senate that those excisions were made under the previous Fraser coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the heavy influence the mining lobby's views seem to have had on the dissenting report. An 11-page addition to one paragraph in chapter 3 is a very lengthy and selective history of the debate about mining and exploration in the area. Significantly, it fails to include any mention of the action of one well known mining company in illegally attempting to continue exploration in stage 2 in the leadup to the World heritage hearing. One sentence from this section of the report is worth particular comment. In referring to mining claims it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately a World heritage listing for an Australian park was paramount to . . . property ownership within the Park. </PARA>
<PARA>Few Australians with any knowledge of or feeling for national parks would accept the philosophical position which is implied here-that private ownership is appropriate in a national park. That leaves aside the hypocrisy of wishing also to deny the rights of the traditional Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Elsewhere the dissenting report, on the subject of royalty payments, states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are opposed to the principle of providing a retrospective benefit to Aboriginal land claimants in a land title in which they had no proprietary interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the mining companies are supposed to have a proprietary interest. How much longer after the Aborigines did they arrive? Prior ownership is clearly determined by those senators on the basis of the colour of the claimants' skin. Is this the intellectual rigour that they claim to have and that they claim we do not have?</PARA>
<PARA> I spoke the week before last about the use of in camera evidence in the dissenting report. I will only add now that that evidence was selectively quoted to omit evidence in conflict with the minority's view on Jawoyn beliefs about the significance of Coronation Hill. My view, formed not only from that evidence but also from other discussion with Jawoyn leaders is that some, perhaps all, of the senior custodians believe genuinely and strongly that Coronation Hill is a significant site and that mining should not take place there or elsewhere in what is known as the `sickness country'. This was put strongly to the previous committee at an informal meeting on Coronation Hill on 21 May 1986. Senator Crichton-Browne was not present on that occasion. The belief was expressed with obvious emotion to us then and has been reiterated by the recent Jawoyn delegation to Canberra which spoke with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Ministers, including, I believe, Senator Richardson, who was also present as a Committee member at that first meeting. It is my firm conviction that that belief is genuinely held and that it should be for the Jawoyn themselves to decide, without pressure, what development can occur on their traditional land. There are many other parts of the dissenting report which are open to criticism as ignoring the balance of evidence or as misperceptions, to put it kindly, about the recommendations in the majority report. I hope to have time to mention a few. The majority recommendation at paragraph 95 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the resources made available for the study of the environmental impact of the Ranger Uranium Mine should, as a minimum, be maintained at current levels. </PARA>
<PARA>The dissenting report then adds these words:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the release of the information not being of a commercial detriment to Ranger Mines. </PARA>
<PARA>The addition seems to be quite unconnected to our recommendation, which makes no mention of any release of information. Again, I wonder where that idea came from. The dissenting report's recommendation on mining in the conservation zone is so loosely worded as to be valueless. It says that approval should not be given to mining if `unacceptable damage' would result. Unacceptable to whom? It then goes on to say that infrastructure should be planned so as to `facilitate, as far as practicable, the later use of the area as a national park'. What does `as far as practicable' mean? It certainly gives me no comfort. I mention one last gem. In a paragraph supporting the miners' claim about effective rehabilitation, the minority report says that Senator Crichton-Browne considered rehabilitated areas in the Myall Lakes region, shown to us as a model, as `more attractive and more substantial than the original vegetation'. He obviously did not notice the increased weed infestation, among other things. If Senator Crichton-Browne was correct, perhaps we should mine or bulldoze all national parks and plant gardens there later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing comments with regard to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region. I suggest that, within that broad title, the word `potential' is probably the key one. While Senator Zakharov has just criticised the dissenting part of the report for what she termed a lack of intellectual integrity, I would highlight the fact that, after three years in preparation, the majority report has now put forward some 40 recommendations, obviously very strongly under the influence of Senator Zakharov, who, I understand, is a psychologist and not necessarily someone with mining or major environmental issues at heart. The remarkable fact is that none of the recommendations directly address the terms of reference that were given to the Committee. The report reaches no conclusion on the nature of the resources available for exploitation or on the impact of the utilisation of these resources. I think it is worth referring to the particular terms of reference. They were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The potential of the Kakadu National Park region with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the nature of the resources available for exploitation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the impact of utilisation of these resources, particularly on mining and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the majority report shirks and evades its prime responsibility. The terms of reference required the Committee to inquire into the nature of the resources available for exploitation in the Kakadu National Park. And during the three-year period of this inquiry-of which Senator Zakharov was Chairman for the period up to the last Federal election-the Federal Government, of which Senator Zakharov is a member, has put in place policies which, by prohibiting any mining exploration within stages 1 and 2 and two-thirds of stage 3 of the park, make it impossible to discover the true value of the mineral wealth of the region. All the countries with developed economies fully exploit their mineral resources if they are competitive. It is not a sign of a developed economy to ignore rich mineral resources. It is difficult to think of any country-east, west, north or south; rich or poor-which would sit on mineral resources of the magnitude that exists in the Kakadu region and do so little to exploit them-any country, that is, except Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report and the dissenting report adopt markedly different stances on the national economic imperatives of exploiting the resources of the region, on the environmental impact of exploitation and on the position of Aboriginals. The majority report makes a series of recommendations which seem intended to put obstacles in the way of mining companies without making firm recommendations for or against mining. However, in the dissenting report, my colleagues Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator McGauran and Senator Panizza conclude that Australia cannot afford to neglect these resources for economic reasons; that the environmental impact would be negligible; and that the Aboriginals would benefit greatly. Kakadu has the land area of a moderately sized country. It is one of the five most mineralised regions in the world. The Ranger mine has proven that a major mine can operate in the area with negligible environmental impact. The Koongarra mine alone would generate some $256m of revenue for Aboriginal interests. Common sense surely dictates that both the national interest and the Aboriginal interests would be best served by a policy of multiple land use which allows mining to proceed subject to rational environmental controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, I believe the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) should hand over management of this park to the Northern Territory Government. This would place the Northern Territory on a similar footing to that of the States. The ANPWS management of the parks is an obstacle to tourist development. Tourist infrastructure is inadequate for even current park visitors, and this is frustrating for the tourist industry and possibly a hazard to the environment in the long term. The majority report recommends that a board of management be established with a majority of Aboriginal traditional land owners. This is simply ludicrous, particularly when one takes into account the numbers of people and the resources that are available to them in the particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to reconcile the emphasis given in the majority report to the consideration of Aboriginal interest with the Committee's terms of reference. I remind the Senate-and the report acknowledges this-that there are only 277 Aborigines living in the Kakadu region of 19,804 square kilometres. Ninety-three per cent of stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park is not Aboriginal land, and no claim has been granted on stage 3. Yet the majority report recommends that a board with a majority of traditional owners be created to manage Kakadu National Park. The majority report seeks to impose stringent Aboriginal employment conditions on mining company projects within the region. However, the dissenting report remarks that it is virtually impossible to locate in the park Aborigines who are available and prepared to work. Seventy-five per cent of the people employed by the Gagudju Association are white, and the two hotels owned by that Association employ 100 staff, of whom only five are Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissenting report finds evidence of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal attitudes to mining factually incorrect. Revenue which would flow to Aboriginal interests from the Koongarra mine alone, as I said earlier, is established at some $256m. The majority report calls for royalty payments to Aboriginal groups who have lodged land claims-in effect, retrospective benefits. The dissenting report states that this would place mining companies in an intolerable situation and the prospects of financial blackmail are enormous. I would certainly commend the commonsense attitude that has been taken by Senators Crichton-Browne, McGauran and Panizza. Their report very adequately reflects the views that I think are generally and widely held and with which most of the community would be very comfortable. Let me give some quotes from the dissenting report which I believe accurately reflect its particular emphasis. On page 263 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if it could be shown that, with proper management, resource development would produce wealth for Australia with little or no damage to the environment, then a compelling argument is to be had for such exploitation. The current Government policy excludes such determinations in all but the Conservation Zone. </PARA>
<PARA>A further quote from page 263 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite irresponsible and improper for any Government to attempt to develop policy on mining, tourism or any other land use without having assembled the relevant and imperative information. However, what can be asked is whether Australia can afford to forgo many billions of dollars of natural wealth because that wealth is located in an area around which a national park has been declared. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from page 264:</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that permission be given for the Jabiluka and Koongarra mines to go into production. To put aside a recommendation would be to fail in many respects to address the central questions which the Senate directed to the Standing Committee on National Resources and, subsequently, the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee to consider and report upon . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Page 270 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend the adoption of a policy of balanced and sensitive multiple land use within Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the dissenting report that is being considered by the Senate, relating to the potential of Kakadu National Park, which properly reflects common sense and a blueprint for governments to adopt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might respond first to the suggestion that has been put by Senator Zakharov, in a very uncharitable and inaccurate way, that our minority report reflected the subjective and vested views of the mining industries. Let me say that that is, without doubt, totally untrue, and Senator Zakharov in her heart would know it. I am disappointed that she has said other than that which she knows to be the truth. The minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts was written on the basis of the quality of the evidence provided, the integrity of that evidence, and its capacity to be subject to probing and testing on its presentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The quality of the evidence which was provided by some of the anti-mining groups, some of the anti-uranium groups, some of those who maintain a level of prejudice, bigotry, bias and distortion which even I had never seen before, reflects upon them and is a statement about them. If I could not find some merit in their argument, it was not because I was biased, but because of the distortion of the evidence. I am sure that Senator Zakharov knows that. I come to the central question which caused this report to be put forward. The terms of reference were compiled as a result of a suggestion put by me to Senator Graham Richardson, now the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, who said he thought the proposal for the inquiry had a great deal of virtue and merit and that he would support it. There was no point in my putting it to the Committee-as Senator Zakharov would know-without at least the support of some Government members, because the terms of reference would have failed to be adopted from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one ought to look at the quality of the recommendations of the majority report. I say to the Senate, with respect, that they reek of prejudice, are fraught with distortion and fail on the central point of honesty. The question to be put at the beginning of the day by all of us was whether mining ought to take place in Kakadu National Park. Senator Zakharov knew that, I knew it, and every member of the Committee knew it. At the end of the day, the majority report failed to address that question. Why did it do so? It was because Senator Zakharov had already publicly committed herself to opposing mining in Kakadu National Park. Senator Zakharov was already totally opposed to uranium mining anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Senator Bob Collins, an Australian Labor Party senator for the Northern Territory, has publicly committed himself to mining in Kakadu National Park. Senator Collins was the spearhead of the Koongarra group of Aboriginal people who came down to Hobart and lobbied outside the Australian Labor Party National Conference, calling upon that Conference to agree to mining at Koongarra. Senator Collins knows that mining at Koongarra is worth $650m to the Aboriginal community alone. But in order not to have a conflict in the Committee and so as not to divide the Australian Labor Party members of that Committee, they did what one would expect in this day and age: they pragmatically judged it was wiser to make no recommendation. Therefore, nobody was offended, nobody had to dissent and nobody had to disagree. In that way, Senator Zakharov, Senator Collins, Senator Black and the Australian Democrats could agree to a report, which ended up being the majority report. But they made no real report; they made no recommendation; they made no findings. I believe that is a cheap way of writing reports. It reflects pretty unfairly on the normal integrity of standing committee reports put down in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, let me remind you that when the time came to make recommendations in respect of whether there ought to be tourism in the park, fishing in the park or hunting in the park; whether a township ought to be built in the park-and the effects of Jabiru township on the park-or whether buffalo ought to be allowed in the park, the majority report had no difficulty in reaching a conclusion. That was because those members were of one accord. It was only when they had to swallow the fundamental question of uranium mining that they choked and threw up a report of the quality and nature of this one. That is what happened at the end of the day. Notwithstanding their judgment as to what sort of report it ought to be and what sort of a park we ought to have-it seemed to me that it almost had to remain in its pristine state before they would be satisfied-notwithstanding the fact that they said there should be no commercial fishing or hunting, or hunting as a recreational sport, that no exotic diseases or animals should be introduced; one is not allowed, if one lives in Jabiru, to own two cats; at the end of the day, the majority report recommended that wild buffalo be left in the park. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Australian ecology and environment are not compatible with hard-hoofed animals. Senator Zakharov ought to know that. Not only are they being encouraged to remain in the park at a time when an eradication program is going on to remove them because of the damage that they cause, but also Senator Zakharov is suggesting that their presence ought to be enshrined in law. Why? Because the Aboriginal community is now used to them. Senator Zakharov describes them as part of the Aboriginals' `natural, staple diet'. I have to tell Senator Zakharov that that does not mean that one should build a Hungry Jack's there just because the inhabitants have got used to such food. The truth is that Senator Zakharov has totally trampled on every single principle she has had so far so as to leave buffaloes there. The majority report has no integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the heart of the question of in camera evidence. This is the second time that Senator Zakharov has raised the matter. This is not a reflection on Senator Zakharov; I do not wish to be pulled up under the Standing Orders. It is my view that there are those who had a vested interest to ensure that that evidence never be given public airing because it did not agree with, and was totally incompatible with, the majority report. At Barunga, when the Aboriginal community was given a chance to give evidence, it said almost without exception that it not only wanted uranium mining in Kakadu National Park, but also invited and embraced it. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Coronation Hill, it was news to members of the community that that site was of some sacred significance or of some spiritual interest to them. It was only after they had been told by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority of the Northern Territory that this was a sacred site that the revelation struck them; they learned for the first time that there was something there of significance to them. At the end of the day, the decision was not made by them; it was made by a bunch of white people in the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority in Darwin, who had their own agenda. That agenda meant no mining for uranium in Kakadu National Park; it had nothing to do with the interests of the Aboriginal community. Those people have been used and abused, and they will be put aside in due course when this group goes on to some new and better agenda to give us a country that it believes in, not one which represents the views of the vast majority of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The golden thread that ran through this report, as best I can identify one, was that so much was not known about uranium mining and its effect on the park. Having come across no evidence that could show that there had been any damage to the park in the past as a result of uranium mining, a mist and a cloud of mystique and the unknown had to be thrown up, as no evidence of previous effects and previous damage could be referred to. It ought not to be forgotten that so far 1,000 reports have been written about the effect of uranium mining in Kakadu National Park, and 150 alone in respect of the tailings dam in the Ranger uranium mine area. There was no intellectually compelling technical evidence given to the Committee which suggested for a moment that uranium mining had had any significant detrimental effect upon the ecology, the environment or the general area of Kakadu National Park. Because that evidence was there, we suddenly had to engage in the mystique and say that it is what we do not know that counts, not what we do know. </PARA>
<PARA> I found the majority report disappointing because it did not seek to address the fundamental questions which it was required to. For instance, it did not address the question of why we can have mining at Ranger, yet we cannot have it at Koongarra. The way the problem was solved by the Australian Labor Party was to draw the lines around the areas that were economically viable and then it could argue that it had ensured the integrity of the park. Of course that was untrue and quite intellectually dishonest. So I recommend that all those who want spiritual enlightenment, who want to learn something and who have an unbiased and objective view as to the effect of the Kakadu National Park should read the minority report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, one element that comes under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is the invitations to the opening of the new Parliament House. This received a great deal of attention in Estimates Committee A. For the record, it is particularly disturbing to me, as a senator, that two standards have been applied in this matter. These double standards involve the list of the invitees of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the list of invitees of a few other people. For example, the list of invitees of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the list of invitees of the Prime Minister must remain secret, whereas the names of the people that I invited as my guests to the opening are not secret-they are not to be held aside and the public is entitled to find out who I invited to this opening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see nothing wrong with that, provided exactly the same criterion is applied to the Prime Minister's guests. Yet we discovered in the Senate Estimates Committee that the Prime Minister's extensive guest list is to remain confidential on the grounds, we were told at the Senate Estimates Committee, that the people who accepted those invitations were not aware of the fact that their names would be made public. Their faces were made public as they came in; there were television cameras and photographs were taken. There was no suggestion of secrecy at that point and there has been no suggestion that my invitees' names should remain secret. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne has said, it may be that that is because I am not ashamed of my friends. I find it intolerable that, in a public situation like this, questions that I believe are quite right, and that may well even have some historic significance in terms of who was here at the opening, are not to be made available to the people of Australia and to the Parliament. I ask a very simple and direct question of this Government: Is it because this Government is concerned about allegations that the Prime Minister and/or other senior members of this Parliament appear to have rich mates in big business, or other kinds of mates-is it because of this mates problem-that these names are not to be made public? Or is it because a genuine principle is involved? If a genuine principle is involved, why does that principle not extend to other members of parliament who have guests at such a function?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think these double standards are intolerable. I simply ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) directly: Is it a fact that, on that secret list, names such as Mr Kornhauser appear? The refusal of the Government to provide that list and the incredible double standards involved in denying us access to that list while making public our guests' names seem to suggest to me that such a question is totally appropriate in the circumstances, and I invite the Minister to reply to it. </PARA>

Mr Chairman, forgive me for not being attentive, but I did not realise that we were going to deal so expeditiously with these matters. I want to ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) some questions relating to the Perth Airport. I understand that there is a proposal to upgrade the Perth Airport with a $60m redevelopment in the domestic terminal area. Is the decision to upgrade the domestic terminal inconsistent with the Government's previous decision not to upgrade the terminal in favour of the 1983 master plan which set out the development of a new main terminal and parallel runway complex?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications has bought new land in the area of Newburn which presumably is for the expansion of the new international airport. When is it proposed that the third runway will be commenced? Will the Minister agree that the proposed master plan will result in less noise pollution for residents in the vicinity of the airport, given that aircraft will be landing on and departing from the parallel runway over industrial land and not over residential areas, as is now occurring? When will that portion of land situated in the suburb of Newburn and set aside for future construction of the new terminal and parallel runway be transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation from the Department of Administrative Services? What are the present proposals of the Department of Administrative Services in relation to the lease of the subject land? Has the Minister taken steps to ensure that major development of the subject land will not occur so as to impede the future use of the area for the airport redevelopment? If not, will he undertake to do so? What steps have been taken to ensure that there is no further extension of the existing east-west runway, runway  06/24, which takes aircraft over residential areas of the city of Belmont? What timeframe exists for the development of a new terminal and parallel runway? If no timetable exists, will the Minister explain why there is no timetable?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a question with regard to ex gratia payments, which come, as far as I am aware, under the purview of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), as is the one who usually either approves or, more generally, disapproves them. This case is a matter that I have referred to before in this place. It involves a particularly unsavoury case of the sexual harassment of a female officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). She joined the Air Force in 1980. She suffered a considerable amount of sexual harassment in 1982. She was finally forced out of the Air Force and into private life. I say at this point that the two officers concerned and some other people who had been involved in the harassment were eventually dismissed or otherwise disciplined for their actions. So there was definitely an acknowledgment by the Air Force that the woman had been subjected to the treatment she claimed. There is no question of somebody simply making an issue that is nebulous. It was one that was categorised. She was proven to be correct and the people concerned were disciplined. In any event, she left the Air Force and went into private life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The harassment continued after she left the Air Force, after she moved away from that State to another State. I might add here that her marriage breakdown is a consequence not only of the sexual harassment but also of the allegations by those who were accused of it that she was a lesbian. She was put under enormous physical and emotional stress. On top of all that, having moved to another State, she discovered that the harassment was continuing. She lost, for example, a work contract when the contractor who was to employ her was informed by a couple of RAAF personnel that she was a homosexual. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think this sort of thing should be tolerated anywhere at all, but it certainly should not be tolerated in government employment of this sort without being challenged. There was a strong recommendation for an ex gratia payment for the woman concerned from both the Commonwealth Ombudsman and from the Defence Force Ombudsman. There was no question at all that she had been treated particularly badly and harassed out of her chosen field of employment. The recommendation for an ex gratia payment was turned down by the Minister for Finance because he alleged that the harassment took place before the Sex Discrimination Act, which makes it an offence for this sort of harassment to continue-indeed, to take place at all-came into force. I dispute the Minister's rationale because that harassment has continued since she left the Air Force, and it has been continued by RAAF personnel. That alone should make the Minister think again on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised the matter during the Comcare debate in June this year. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who I think was on duty in the chamber at the time, asked for more information. I passed on the details to his private secretary. Earlier this month I rang Senator Bolkus's office. His officers said that the best way to deal with it in their opinion was for me to have a meeting with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, whose area of operation deals with personnel, so that we between us could decide on the best approach to make to the Minister for Finance. Presumably Senator Bolkus and/or his office thought that both Ros Kelly and I bearding Peter Walsh in his den was likely to have more impact than would one of us on our own. In any event, it is not always possible for two people as busy as we are to meet with another Minister to get something like this fixed up. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a genuine case here for an ex gratia payment. The harassment took place when the woman concerned was in the Air Force. It continued after she left the Air Force and after the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act. That, in its own right, means that the Minister is not justified in denying an ex gratia compensatory payment to this woman simply because he believes that the original harassment took place prior to the passage of the Act and that it is that harassment and only that harassment for which she is entitled to claim an ex gratia payment. I do not believe this is the case. I believe that the recommendations from both the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Defence Force Ombudsman need to be taken into account. I ask the Minister, who is now in the chamber, to reconsider his decision not to recommend that ex gratia payment, despite the high level of support for it, and to reconsider on the point that since the harassment has been continued-and it has been continued by defence personnel-this woman deserves what little monetary compensation she can get from the Government as a consequence of being forced out of her chosen field of employment and in at least one instance denied access to another job as a continuation of the harassment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is the appropriate occasion to raise a matter concerning the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). It was established in April of 1976 with a number of, I would have thought, quite important functions. It was set up to examine proposals by foreign interests for investment in Australia and to make recommendations to the Government on those proposals. It was also required to advise the Government on foreign investment matters generally. That is a fairly vital element of investment in this country. It is certainly raising concerns in the community generally. Just how much of the farm and indeed the cities Australia is selling to foreign investors is something we do not know. Understandably, this is worrying a lot of people. We have no idea what parts of Australia are being bought up, what quantities, at what price or by whom. Part of the problem obviously is that Australia does not have a foreign ownership register. There is no way anybody in this country has of knowing who is buying what, what price they are paying for it, whether they are resident here and from which countries they come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty with the FIRB is that it has an advisory function only. Responsibility for the administration of the Government's foreign investment policy and for making decisions on those proposals lies entirely with the Treasurer. It seems to me that the current Treasurer (Mr Keating) should be making more effort to take into account not only the feeling so Australians who are seeing large tracts of Australian land and property bought up by residents of other countries; he should also be concerned about what this is doing to the long term financial credibility of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Board was established in April of 1976 only one case has been prosecuted under the Foreign Takeovers Act, and I understand that that case was unsuccessful. Not only does it appear that the Government is not one jot concerned about who is buying up parts of Australia but also it is not apparently even concerned they are doing it appropriately and in accordance with whatever guidelines there may be in existence. Because if it has prosecuted only once in the last 12 years it obviously has not been keeping a close eye on what has been purchased by people from other countries. Even in that case, since it was unsuccessful, it would appear that there are loopholes one could drive the proverbial truck through. The penalties that exist for breach of guidelines and the law are simply not being applied to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> That means that under the previous Fraser Government and under the current Hawke Government the Foreign Investment Review Board is nothing more than a piece of window-dressing to give gullible Australians the feeling that we are not selling off the farm when the reality of the situation is that the Hawke Government has downgraded the Foreign Investment Review Board from a division to a branch to begin with and then reduced its staff from 40 to fewer than 20. What makes that worse is that some of the 20 are part time temporaries and the FIRB is unable to fill some positions because of staff ceilings. All of this is happening at a time of dramatic increase in the number and value of foreign investment proposals. One could perhaps understand the staff being more than halved if proposals were dropping, if there were fewer people interested in buying up real estate or businesses in Australia, but that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer announced recently that the Foreign Investment Review Board is getting something like 400 inquiries per week about foreign purchases of urban real estate. In 1986-87-those are the latest figures that we have available-the Foreign Investment Review Board considered 1,352 proposals for investment in Australia. It did that with fewer than two dozen people. Of those 1,352 proposals, 1,347 were approved. A mere five proposals were rejected. That is a rejection rate of 0.4 per cent or thereabouts. Either all 1,347 proposals were crystal clear, absolutely above board, or the FIRB is simply too understaffed to be looking into the proposals adequately. I find it quite extraordinary and most unlikely that less than half a per cent of proposals would be rejected. If the FIRB is under-resourced and it is approving 99.6 per cent of all investment proposals, and the Treasurer refuses to prosecute those who infringe the Foreign Takeovers Act, it is clear that the Foreign Investment Review Board is being undermined because the Government lacks the political will to control and reduce the level of foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge at this point that the Government is moving in the area of the developed residential market so that we cannot have the New Zealanders, the Japanese, the Saudi Arabians or anybody else moving in here and, for investment purposes, buying up a lot of Australian residential property and putting the price of ordinary home ownership outside the means of many Australian families. We will certainly be supporting that legislation. It is overdue. But, by the same token, the Government needs to pay far more attention to other foreign investment in this country. What is more, the Australian people are entitled to know not only what is being bought and how much is being paid for it, so that they have some slight chance of working out what it is doing to the economy of this country, but also who is doing it. Australian corporations are allowed to increase our foreign indebtedness and they get a tax deduction into the bargain. That is bad enough. But when the FIRB is also being prevented from controlling the increasing level of foreign investment here, then we have a game of double jeopardy being played. It is the Australian people and the economy of this nation that are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment certainly gives Australia the foreign currency to pay the interest bill accumulated by the local borrowers, but it is absurd that we have put ourselves into that position in the first place. What we have essentially done to ourselves is make Australia a sort of hotbed of international junkies, selling our businesses and, up until the time this legislation is passed, selling our homes, for heaven's sake, to foreign investors so that we can get the foreign currency we need to pay the interest on our overseas debts run up by local companies and corporations with the enthusiastic encouragement, it seems, of a Government which continues to offer tax concessions to people who put themselves in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> Even a quick look at the Foreign Investment Review Board's report of 1986-87 gives us some idea of the magnitude of the foreign investment that we are talking about. On page 4, under the heading `Summary of Proposals', we find this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>Total expected investment associated with foreign investment proposals approved by the Government in 1986-87 was $18.5 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, $18.5 billion of foreign investment was approved by the Government. That is nearly double the 1985-86 expected level of $9.8 billion. This is the second successive year of massive growth in the level of foreign investment. That investment occurred, the report tells us, across most sectors, the notable exceptions being resources processing, finance and insurance, for which I suppose we should be grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the $18.5 billion expected investment in the last financial year, 89 per cent was attributed to takeovers and acquisitions and the remainder to new businesses. About 70 per cent of the total expected new business activity, that is, about $1.9 billion worth, was concentrated in the services sector, much of it in tourism development. In recent times we have seen the Japanese, in particular, moving into the services and tourism area. They are building hotels on the Gold Coast for Japanese tourists. They are buying golf courses in Sydney to be used by Japanese tourists. They are running tourist shops, presumably to be patronised by Japanese tourists. That means that Australia is missing out on a lot of money because the profits will be going back to Japan. Most of the expected expenditures were in real estate. In 1986-87 $5.2 billion worth of Australian real estate was sold to foreigners, $5.6 billion in services, $3.9 billion in manufacturing and $2.3 billion in mining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is denying the Australian public information to which they are entitled if we give them no information at all about who the buyers are and what they bought with the incredible amounts of money they have been spending. It is essential that, at the very least, we have a register of foreign ownership in this country so that we know who is buying what, even if the Government is not prepared to stop them buying it. It would be a whole lot better if the Government gave some teeth to the Foreign Investment Review Board so that it was not expected, with a staff of under 20, to deal with over 1,300 inquiries. It would be even better if the Government placed the same sorts of restrictions on foreign ownership in Australia that most other countries place on foreign ownership in their countries. Australians cannot waltz into Hong Kong, Japan, or anywhere else much, and buy up the sorts of services, real estate and businesses that we are calmly selling off virtually to anybody who walks in here with the money to pay for them. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), the Treasurer and the Government as a whole seriously to reconsider the Government's whole policy on foreign investment before we wake up one morning and find that we have sold ourselves to a conglomerate made up of the Japanese and the Saudi Arabians. </PARA>

It has come, though, as something of a shock to those of us who have regularly sat on Estimates committees in the last few weeks, especially those in the Liberal and National parties, not to have seen one Australian Democrat attend such meetings in order to question the Government on the very kinds of issues that have been brought up just now. We find those issues being brought forward on days when parliamentary broadcast is available to the Democrats. They make their cheap shots and the points they seek to get across without committing themselves at all to any of the kind of work that real senators have to do in order to examine properly the affairs of the Government. We do not support that kind of principle, that kind of activity, that kind of hypocrisy on the part of the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to raise one or two points concerning Estimates Committee C which arose during the recent Estimates examinations. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) will recall that recently the Committee had before it the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher. He will recall, I think, the question which Opposition senators raised with regard to the raid on Citibank Ltd and the audit that followed thereafter. The question raised during the course of that debate was whether, through the action of the auditors conducting their raid on Citibank Ltd in Melbourne and the action of the regional director of the Australian Taxation Office in Melbourne in releasing a press release coincidentally with that raid, there could possibly have been an offence under section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators know that that section of the Act is very relevant because it protects the secrecy of the affairs of taxpayers as they are handled by the Commissioner of Taxation. The point we raised was simply this: because the Deputy Commissioner in Victoria issued a press release-albeit that no names were referred to, the activities undertaken by the Tax Office certainly were mentioned-and almost simultaneously the raid on City Bank Ltd became public knowledge, as the media had been tipped off, the two events were, of course, very clearly identified in the public mind. When that kind of action occurs there could possibly be a breach of the secrecy provisions by the Commissioner of Taxation. He might argue, on a technicality, that he did not, by issuing a press release, identify the name of a taxpayer. He might very well claim that. I think that argument would fall to the ground on the basis that it would be so easy to relate the raid on City Bank Ltd to the issue of a press release. There is a nice little loophole for the Commissioner of Taxation to exploit and identify taxpayers, thereby breaching the secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise that point again today. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate some further remarks by the Commissioner of Taxation in a speech that he made to the Police Club in Adelaide last Monday. In that speech the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, said that he was examining a scheme whereby he would be able to list, presumably by category of taxable income, not so much the names but certainly the size of various companies operating in Australia. He would then identify, presumably in aggregate, the income of those companies and also the amount of tax that each of them would be paying. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know how zealous Mr Boucher is about the taxation law. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate that if such a procedure were adopted it would be a relatively easy thing for ordinary people in the community, because of the sheer numbers that would be aggregated in such an exercise, to identify which companies were in fact included in that aggregation. This could very easily lead to the disclosure of information, again in breach of the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That point has to be noted now before the Commissioner of Taxation goes too far down the track of trying to nail skins to the wall, hanging up taxpayers wherever he sees them. We have a developing situation and he may very well, by some loophole in the law, be observing the actual letter of the law but breaching the spirit of it. I think his statements in recent times have led us to the point of view that the spirit of the law has to be observed rather than the mere letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, Mr Chairman, when we have other opportunities to raise these matters, we ought to debate at greater length this developing practice on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation. Suffice to say, at this point of time we are put on notice that there is a question mark about that kind of behaviour on the part of the Taxation Office. This practice could very well lead to the identification of individual taxpayers, intentionally or otherwise, by the Commissioner of Taxation and could breach that fundamental principle of the taxation law that the taxpayers' affairs are secret between him and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that if that principle were consistently breached we would see the annihilation of the principle, accepted up to now, of the maintenance of the independence of a Commissioner of Taxation. The income tax administration has been founded, as we all know, on the principle of there being an independent Commissioner, separate from government, separate from the Department of the Treasury, so that he can conduct his business with taxpayers without that information being disclosed to the political government. That is the fundamental principle upon which we have conducted our affairs over a long period. It is fundamental to our system of British justice. It is certainly fundamental to the principles by which taxation has been raised since the time of the Stuart Kings. Consequently, it is one of the very real principles that could well be at risk in the event of the Commissioner of Taxation taking us too far down the road that he has now embarked upon. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bruce Childs,</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the proper role of Estimates Committee Chairmen in the hearings of Estimates Committees has been raised with me, and in response I believe it would be useful to set out briefly what I consider to be the proper respective roles of Chairmen, members, Ministers and officers in Estimates Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> As I see it, the role of the Chairman is to ensure that the procedures laid down by the Senate are correctly followed. These procedures are provided by standing order 36ab, under which Estimates Committees are appointed, other standing orders of the Senate and the resolution of 15 February 1988 relating to witnesses in so far as it is applicable to Estimates Committees. The most important task of the Chairman is to ensure that questions put to Ministers and officers are relevant, that is, that they relate to the expenditure of the department or authority under examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the members and other Senators attending the hearings is to seek information by putting questions to the Minister and officers. Questioning, of course, can be detailed, probing and forthright in seeking to reveal maladministration. Chairmen should not seek to prevent tough questioning as such, but should seek to ensure that questions are put and answered in an orderly way, for example, that there is no disruptive interrupting of questions and answers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for the Minister in attendance to determine in the first instance whether any particular question will be answered and whether it will be answered by officers. If a Minister considers that the questioning of officers is placing an undue burden on them, it is open to the Minister to determine that questions will be taken on notice or to assume responsibility for answering the questions. It should not be the role of the Chairman to protect the Minister or officers from questioning, unless the questions are clearly not relevant, the procedures of the Senate are otherwise being violated, or there is disorder. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to suggest that any Chairmen have not followed proper procedures or have not properly carried out their role, or that Chairmen would not be aware of these matters, but the question of the role of Chairmen having been raised with me, I considered it appropriate to set down these thoughts. </PARA>
<PARA> If you have any comments on the procedures of Estimates Committees I would be happy to receive them. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>(Kerry W. Sibraa)</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the President for that letter and for pointing out how important it is for unbiased, sensible chairmanship. I would like to underline how unusual this type of chairmanship is because I have certainly never received such treatment before. The Chairman of the Estimates Committee of which I am a member, Senator Mal Colston, has always been fair, unbiased and thoroughly just to senators who ask sometimes very tough questions of departmental officers. This was also the case with Senator Aulich on the occasion of the Senate Estimates Committee hearing when I questioned officers of the Attorney-General's Department regarding the household expenditure survey-the very same subject that inspired my questions to Estimates Committee C. I thank Senator Aulich for allowing me free questioning of those departmental officers. The report of Estimates Committee C included a dissenting report by the Opposition members of that Committee. As I say, I was not a member of that Committee; I was just a visiting senator. The dissenting report was also critical of Senator Crowley's chairmanship. It referred, I think, to her continual interruption of our questioning. She interrupted me on 14 separate occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no intention of going through the Hansards of the hearings and itemising each occasion on which Senator Crowley breached the Standing Orders of the Senate. Time certainly would not permit that. Suffice it to say that in my contribution to the debate on the appropriations this week I referred repeatedly to the fact that the Australian Bureau of Statistics was conducting an illegal survey. Not once was I ruled out of order by Mr President. But on each occasion that I referred at the Estimates Committee hearing to the illegality of this survey, Senator Crowley ruled my question out of order or demanded a rephrasing. Not only that, but on many occasions she refused to allow me to ask questions, claiming that I had asked them previously. On one of these occasions, the officer of whom I was asking a question decided to answer, as he was well aware that I had not asked that question previously. I could give many examples, as recorded in Hansard, of the inaccuracy of that particular ruling. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken singly, Senator Crowley's rulings could best be described as childish, but when taken in toto this type of chairmanship, as I have said previously, strikes at the very basis of the Senate committee system-a system which I believe is one of the most important parts of the Senate's work. It is for that reason that I told Senator Crowley at the time of the hearings that I believed it was necessary to bring my concerns to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Walters has been describing relates to only one part of the Government's obstruction of its accountability, as an Executive, to Parliament. One of Parliament's essential foundations is that the Government-that is, the Executive-is accountable to the Parliament. One of the reasons why we are here debating the Appropriation Bills is the old, well-established Westminster principle which has been taken up in every parliament based on the Westminster model all around the world; that is, that the government will be able to appropriate money only with the approval of Parliament. For us in the Senate to do our work more effectively, many years ago we set up Estimates committees. The six senators who sit on an Estimates committee examine minutely, line by line, the Budget of the Executive Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this instance we had before us one statutory authority, one instrument of the Executive Government; that is, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). There is in the Bill that is before the Committee now an appropriation which relates to providing money for the ABS to carry out its work. There is a requirement in the Act governing the Australian Bureau of Statistics-that is, law established by Parliament-for accountability and due approval to be given by Parliament for a program of the ABS to be undertaken in certain circumstances. What we found in the examination of this Government's executive action was that the Government was wanting; that there is an illegality in a program which the Government is pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walters has just now been speaking about the conduct of the chairman of one of the Estimates committees; that is, the Government senator who, as is our tradition in this chamber, chairs the Estimates committee's inquiries. Instead of giving fair play to the quite rightful, dutiful questions asked by senators of the Executive Government, we saw in the conduct of the Chair a bias towards protecting the Government to which that senator has allegiance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not impute improper motives to the Chair, but I am entirely critical, along with all my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, of the conduct of the Chair of Estimates Committee C in this instance. I am saying that this is part of a fabric of the Executive Government in recent times not living up to its proper accountability to Parliament. It is the Cabinet that is ultimately accountable to this Parliament for whatever decision it makes. A Minister of the Government is accountable to this Parliament, and a Minister acting for a Minister in the Senate is accountable-and so are the officers of any department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the examination of the ABS survey, let me come to the point of the decision that was made by the Labor Cabinet. Earlier this year the Hawke Labor Government decided to approve an ABS household expenditure survey. This survey, amounting to more than 200 questions, was to be put to thousands of Australian households to enquire into the exact expenditure of that household on all items in a particular period. It was an enormously burdensome survey. A person whose household received the knock on the door from the ABS surveyor would have to spend hours and days to meet the requirements of the survey, and every kind of personal fact would need to be disclosed in the survey. One would have to disclose everything about one's house loan; what the value of one's property was; how much of a loan one had; whether one had three loans; whether it was a first or a second mortgage; whether there were any unsecured loans. People would be asked about their health. One would be asked: `Of every member of your household, how many visits have been made to the doctor? For what purpose? With what outcome? Give your full health history. Do you have a first job, a second job, a third job? What hours do you work? What are you paid?'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sheil" NAMEID="BJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, `What is your tax return? What is your gross taxable income? What is your net taxable income? What did you claim as a tax deduction? What was your tax refund?' It then deals even with the minutiae of household expenditure on food. It asks, `How much for the spaghetti? How many dozen eggs did you buy? How many litres of milk? Did you get it at a cut price supermarket? Where do you buy things? What did you give to the children for pocket money?'. People are told to keep a diary over weeks on every item of expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I am very critical of the minutiae of this overly burdensome and intrusive survey, let me say that there are appropriate samplings and questionings by the Bureau of Statistics that we in the Opposition very much support. Of course we support the principle of the existence of the ABS, and we support the rightful conduct, particularly through voluntary surveys, of appropriate matters on which government and other bodies will, because of the collection of statistics, make economic and other decisions. But the point about this survey is that it is twice as intrusive and twice as burdening of the Australian public as anything we have seen before-and there have been several household expenditure surveys in the past, including two surveys approved by a Liberal-National Party Cabinet. These were tabled in the Parliament and were open to scrutiny-and they gained bipartisan support in both chambers of the Parliament. That is not the case with regard to this household expenditure survey. It is excessively burdensome, it is excessively intrusive, and it does not have bipartisan support in the Parliament. The Opposition regards the survey as illegal. We say that the ABS has gone beyond the line and that the Cabinet has gone beyond the line. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, as the person responsible for the ABS, has gone over the line. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining the line-by-line budget with regard to ABS spending, Opposition senators want to ask a range of questions. Five hours of questions were put by the Estimates Committee to officers of the ABS and to the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who is in the chamber and who represents the Treasurer. Those five hours of questions led us to various conclusions. Let me refer to those conclusions before moving a motion with regard to that conclusion. The conclusion which we set out in a report attached to the Estimates Committee C report to the Senate is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It is our conclusion that the survey is not legal. This assessment is not only based on the inadequate information basis of the Attorney-General Department's ruling of August 11, but also on the advice of the Clerk of the Senate and the independent legal opinion of Professor Douglas Whalan. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walters, in her speech during the second reading debate on this Bill, outlined very meticulously why it is our conclusion that this survey is illegal. There are significant differences between this survey and earlier surveys, and the Act requires that if there are significant differences, for the survey to be legal the Government must see that the survey is tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, bearing in mind all that has already been recorded in the report from Estimates Committee C, in Senator Walters's speech during the second reading debate, and in what I have said by way of introduction, I now move, pursuant to the procedural motion moved by Senator Cook earlier this day:</PARA>
<PARA> That, having considered the report of Estimates Committee C:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The Committee is of the opinion that the Government should not continue with the ABS Household Expenditure Survey conducted from July 1988 on the grounds that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the survey is significantly different from earlier HES surveys and, as such, to be legal should have been tabled in Parliament prior to the survey being conducted; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the survey is extraordinarily burdensome and intrusive towards those members of the Australian public selected by compulsion for inclusion in the survey. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) The Committee is of the opinion that the Government should not in the future proceed with any ABS survey unless-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) where the survey is significantly different from surveys conducted prior to July 1988, the proposed survey and the proposed terms of conduct of the survey are tabled in Parliament and the Parliamentary debate on the proposed survey is fully taken into account; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the proposed survey is not extraordinarily burdensome and intrusive towards those members of the Australian public selected for inclusion in the survey. </PARA>
<PARA>It is in the best interests not only of the Senate but also of the Australian Bureau of Statistics for this motion to be adopted here today. Unless there is, by the tabling of a proposed survey in Parliament and by the Government of the day taking due notice of the parliamentary debate on that tabled survey, a retention of bipartisan support for important programs of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS will fall into public disrepute and the public will not cooperate with an onerous, intrusive, burdensome survey. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential for this Government, or for a government of which I am a member in the future, to ensure that, by the executive Government being accountable to Parliament and by giving lawful notice to Parliament of the terms of a survey, there is full confidence in the Parliament that this is an appropriate survey and one which we as the representatives of the people can rightly agree with; that it goes forth with full public knowledge that it is lawful and that it is appropriately required that a sample of Australian people comply with it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the case now. Opposition senators are saying to the Australian public that this ABS survey is not legal. Members of the public who do not cooperate with it are rightly calling the bluff of an ABS surveyor who may say, during the doorstop interview, that it is compulsory that the questions be answered by the householder. I believe that the Government should recognise its mistake. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, should recognise his mistake. The Estimates process should be congratulated for bringing to light the inadequacy in the way in which the ABS and this Government have performed in this matter. An amount of $1.3m was expended, according to the appropriations before us, in only the first quarter of the conduct of this illegal survey. We are here to ensure that the appropriation is lawful and appropriate to be approved. That is why I have moved the preceding motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue has arisen mainly because of a misunderstanding, or possibly a misinterpretation by some of the basis of the advice of the Attorney- General (Mr Lionel Bowen) given some time in July. A number of documents were peddled to the press but withheld from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, because to have made the same documents available to the ABS would have spoiled the story and reduced the chance of getting some publicity for those people who were peddling it. This applies in particular to Professor Whalan's advice of 19 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 October, after the Estimates committee hearings had been completed, the ABS became aware of advice that had been provided to Senator Walters by the Clerk on 19 September, three weeks before those hearings began. The advice was in the form of a document by Professor Whalan entitled, `Comments on the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Letter of 15 September 1988 to Mr D. M. Cameron, M.P.'. It was apparent that Professor Whalan's advice, like that given earlier by the Department of the Senate, misrepresented the ABS position. Professor Whalan stated that it is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the 1974-75 and 1975-76 collections, which are now relied on . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That appears in paragraph 14. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the 1974-75 and 1975-76 Surveys being relied on by the ABS to legitimate the 1988 Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>One should interpolate the verb `are' before `being relied on'. That appears in paragraph 19. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the 1974-75 and 1975-76 Surveys (are) claimed as the basis for 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>It was presumably on the strength of that advice that Senator Walters stated on 11 October that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Bureau has repeatedly said that its whole reliance is on the 1974-75 and 1975-76 surveys . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In fact the Bureau made no such statement. Professor Whalan's conclusions appear to have been based on a misinterpretation of the memo of 11 August from the Attorney-General's Department and on a failure to understand that the conclusions of that memo were reached on two alternative bases-one being the surveys in the 1970s and the other being the survey in 1984. To clarify that matter the Statistician asked the Attorney-General's Department on 27 October:</PARA>
<PARA>In considering whether the differences between the 1988-89 Survey and the previous surveys rendered it a `new proposal' is it the changes from 1984 or the cumulative changes since 1974-75 which are relevant?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer of the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, received on 2 November, was:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1988-89 Survey was not a `new proposal' if it was not significantly different from the 1984 Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department also said:</PARA>
<PARA>A single relevant predecessor-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is very important-</PARA>
<PARA>would suffice to prevent the 1988-89 Survey from being a `new proposal'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the opinion of the Secretary of the Department:</PARA>
<PARA>the 1984 proposal, and the subsequent conduct of the 1984 Survey pursuant to that proposal, can be relied on as denying novelty to the 1988-89 Survey if that latter Survey did not differ to any significant extent from the 1984 Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary's opinion continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If there was no significant difference between the 1984 and 1988-89 Surveys, it is unnecessary to decide-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `it is unnecessary to decide'-</PARA>
<PARA>whether the differences between the 1974-75 and 1988-89 Surveys would take the latter Survey beyond the scope of an ongoing program. </PARA>
<PARA>If the ABS had known at an earlier stage of Professor Whalan's misconception, that is, the misconception that the legitimacy of the 1988-89 survey was dependent on the surveys of the mid-1970s-that is, while the Estimates Committee was still sitting until after it had finished-the Bureau's statement at the beginning of the Estimates Committee C hearings could have made it clear that the Attorney-General's Department saw no need to decide about differences between 1974-75 and 1988-89, because the 1984 survey was sufficient precedent. The exploration of these differences, or alleged differences, which consumed much of the time of Estimates Committee C might then have been avoided. These differences were thought to be relevant to the legal position only because of incorrect statements about the ABS position, which were provided to an Opposition senator without the Bureau's knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I go back to where I started. Had all of these opinions, misconceptions, anonymous QC's opinions, QC's opinions and other opinions been provided to the ABS or made public at the time they were made available, instead of being peddled around to the press gallery to try to get publicity for the people doing the peddling, all of this could have been sorted out long ago. Likewise, had the ABS known before, instead of after, the Senate Estimates Committee C conducted its hearings, it could have been sorted out in Estimates Committee C. I think it would be a gross waste of the Committee's time and of taxpayer's money if we spent too much more time talking about this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has put the best possible gloss on the Government's conduct by describing this as arising from a misunderstanding. In a matter as complicated as this, and given the enormous amount of correspondence that has taken place between the various parties trying to analyse and advise, there are inevitably going to be one or two misunderstandings. But by pointing to them, he cannot distract from the lack of proper conduct by the Government, of which the Minister is a part, and by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in particular, and indeed even by the way in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) did not give sufficient information to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) for him to give a legal opinion as to the legality of the survey and so on. I do not accept that this has arisen because of a misunderstanding. I believe the ABS well and truly knows that it messed this up and that it has lost bipartisan parliamentary support and public support in a vital matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the careful conversation that the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines) has had with me. She has agreed to the motions that I have moved if three words are removed in the first motion-that is, the words `to be legal'. Senator Haines will in due course outline her reason for those three words being removed. I am perfectly happy for that amendment to be accepted by the Opposition and for the amended motions to be adopted by this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak for just a few minutes more to ask why this would be only a misunderstanding if a number of the assessments had not been so clearly established. For example, I refer to Mr Giles's, the Assistant Statistician, Social Welfare Branch-that part of the ABS that looks to its relationship with the people of Australia, that looks to the social impact of any program the ABS is to conduct. His clear written advice to the chief Australian Statistician earlier this year, before any of the controversy, was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Household Expenditure Survey is the most burdensome household survey undertaken by the ABS and is also considered to be highly intrusive by some members of the community . . . I therefore seek your approval to table the 1988-89 Household Expenditure Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened? A notation was placed on Mr Giles' letter by the chief Statistician, a `No, for reasons we discussed'. We wanted to know what those reasons were, and we have the knowledge of what those reasons were, which came out only in the Estimates Committee. The advice that was given by the Assistant Statistician was that it should be tabled in the Parliament, and the chief Statistician said, `No'. This was earlier in the year. It came to light that there was public controversy about the survey when it was challenged. I must say that it was challenged effectively by Opposition members of the House of Representatives and this chamber, especially Mr Cameron and Senator Walters. They had the ability to do so-an ability that they ought to have been able to express, along with the rest of us, had that survey been tabled in the Parliament. That ability was far superior to any individual whose door was knocked on by a survey officer, because that person would have to go to the court and would have had to take out some injunction and take some legal proceedings. Instead, members of Parliament rightly raised this matter, and it was raised before it came to the attention of the Attorney-General's Department, before it came to the attention of the Ombudsman and before it came for legal opinion via the Professor and head of the law department and the Australian National University and others, including the Clerk of the Senate. Because members of Parliament were in a position to challenge a matter which ought to have been tabled and been subject to parliamentary discussion, it was appropriate for them to ask officers of the chamber, in this case the Clerk of the Senate, for advice. The Clerk can only give advice, and he gave it. </PARA>
<PARA> When that advice was given and made public and subsequently Professor Whalan's legal opinion was given and also made public, the Australian Statistician then tried to intimidate the Clerk of the Senate. I can only say that that intimidation was entirely transparent and was revealed by examination of the correspondence of every day from 1 to 7 August this year. I can only commend the Clerk of the Senate and any other officers who were involved in this matter for defending themselves admirably. They were not one jot intimidated by the Australian Statistician. I believe that it is greatly to be regretted that a senior public servant-or any public servant or even a Minister-should try to intimidate the Clerk of the Senate, in whom we have full confidence and who has every right to give bona fide information and advice to a member of this chamber who asks it of him. If it was all just a misunderstanding why was Mr Giles's explicit advice given in the first place? Why did a senator refer the matter to the Clerk of the Senate and Professor Whalan and seek their advice? Why was it that early in August, in the heat of all of those exchanges, the Australian Statistician ran to get an opinion from the Attorney-General but failed to give the Attorney-General the information that he required for his conclusion to be worthwhile? When the Attorney-General gave a legal opinion on 11 August it was couched with a couple of provisos. It contained paragraphs which began with the words, `On the basis that this is so'. In other words, if the information supplied was correct then the legal situation was as follows. I will quote from the Attorney-General's letter which said:</PARA>
<PARA>You advise that the only significant change in statistical methodology has been that in the case of rural households the period during which the personal diary must be kept was reduced from four weeks in the 1975-76 and 1984 surveys to two weeks in the 1988-89 survey. Questions of the fact and degree can arise in determining whether a course of action is different in these respects to be a new proposal within the meaning of subsection 6 (3). However, on the basis of the advice you have provided it appears that the 1988-89 survey does not differ to any significant extent from its predecessors. If that is so, in my opinion the proposal in respect of the 1988-89 survey did not answer the description of a new proposal within the meaning of subsection 6 (3). Accordingly if the 1988-89 survey is of the nature you described, tabling under subsection (3) of the ABS Act was not required prior to implementation of that survey. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently we found in the Estimates Committee that that information was totally inadequate and the officers of the ABS admitted squarely that there were other significant differences and that these were not communicated to the Attorney-General and his Department. Why would the Minister try to say that this is all a trivial misunderstanding when all these matters are so substantial and can be summed up by saying that the Government got this wrong; the ABS messed it up? Instead of squarely admitting that and answering frankly questions of the elected members of this Senate in due process in the Estimates Committee, we had officers stone- walling for hours on end to try to live out the fiction that this was totally in order. Finally, why, after three months of all this, was a subsequent opinion sought by the ABS from the Attorney-General's Department, and why was quite contrary advice given by the Attorney-General which led to the tabling on the last day of September--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General advised that the survey should be tabled after all. That is what was contrary. The 11 August advice from the Attorney-General was that there was no need to table the survey; however, on 30 September he advised that it was wise to table it. I will not go into all the detail of what the ABS then wrote in a letter to those being surveyed. It included words to the effect, `If you have failed in the last three months to answer our survey you had better answer it now because now we have got braces as well as belt to ensure that we have based this matter on a proper foundation'. But the ABS has not got that ability because one cannot retrospectively table a survey which has already begun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just mention a number of the substantial assessments of the inadequacies of the Government which are far more than any misunderstanding and are still a matter of correspondence between the Australian Ombudsman, the ABS and the Attorney-General's Department. The Ombudsman has not got answers on these matters, even now on the last day of November, from the ABS and the Attorney-General's Department. Mr Keating has not in any way come clean and answered the matters of doubt that have been raised at various points. I know that the Government Minister in this chamber will say that representatives of the Treasury have maintained all along that this matter is legal. I say that they have been maintaining a stone wall, a fiction, and they have not convinced Opposition members that this has been well conducted. When we have other instances of representatives of this Government saying to Parliament that it is a luxury to have Question Time in the House of Representatives and that the Executive Government ought not be required to have its traditional accountability to Parliament and then we have this instance of an appropriation for a program which is of doubtful legality and which has not been properly answered and accounted for, we can only protest in this way and seek the support of this chamber for the motions that have been moved. </PARA>

<PARA>I am a little concerned-and I would like some assurances from Senator Teague about this-that in not proceeding with the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey conducted from July this year we are not in any way putting future pension increases at risk because of some incapacity on the part of the Government to accurately assess what the consumer price index (CPI) rise has been in a certain period. Even if there is some chance that that is affected, it has been the case in this place that the Government, with the support of the Opposition parties, has in any event discounted or delayed CPI increases to pensioners and ex-service personnel, and I dare say that it will do so again. In any event, I am not sure whether the basket of goodies that is contained as part of the CPI index area is the most valid one to be looking at when it comes to increasing pensions and benefits to people. We will be supporting the two parts of the motion moved by Senator Teague, conditional on the words `to be legal' being deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Teague that there is nothing frightfully binding about the second part, which talks about the proposed survey being tabled, and debated fully by the Parliament and then the debate on the survey being fully taken into account, whatever that might mean-it is a very subjective term. It does not bind this Government or any future government to anything in particular. I suggest also that the words `extraordinarily burdensome' in paragraph (ii) of the second part are also open to vast interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, I think it important that this Government not get away with the arrogant behaviour that we have seen from it in simply barging ahead with what is an intrusive, time-consuming and, to the individuals concerned, often costly exercise. I am not even sure whether it is likely to be a particularly accurate one. This business of keeping an account of how much is spent each day is something that people will get tired of very quickly, and at the end of the day they will just take a pot luck guess at what they spent on vegetables that morning or how much they spent on lunch. To that extent I am not sure whether the value of that part of the survey is nearly as high as some people would like to believe. We feel that the Government has exhibited arrogance in the way it has gone about this in light of the fact that it is reasonably standard practice for these surveys to be tabled and for members of parliament to be given an opportunity to look at them, to raise some questions about them, and to debate them in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In one minute I can give the assurance that I accept, and I expect my colleagues to support, the amendment that has been moved by Senator Haines so that both parts of this motion can be adopted by the Senate. With regard to Senator Haines's question, there is certainly no intention on my part or on the part of anyone in this chamber to in any way diminish or hold up pension increases that will be based on any Australian Bureau of Statistics survey. In fact, I am confident that they will not be, because this household expenditure survey has been conducted only four times in the last 14 years and the consumer price index is determined on the basis of quarterly surveys of another kind. It is with a very real assurance that I am confident that that will not jeopardise pension increases.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well understand the frustration of members of the Opposition on Estimates Committee C, with all the skylarking that went on. For the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to come into the chamber now and say that the whole row was based on a misconception must be a further frustration for them. Incidentally, I did not come into the chamber to speak on this matter, but I am quite happy to say a few words. I think the two parts of the motion moved by Senator Teague are very good but probably do not go far enough, because neither House of the Parliament has the power to reject in whole or in part any of the proposals that the Australian Statistician is likely to table. Honourable senators would have noticed that, over the years, he has been tabling those proposals under the papers of the Clerk and not under ministerial papers. I think that was another move by the Statistician to remove himself from the purview of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not within the power of either House of Parliament to disallow any part of those proposals, which makes me wonder why the Statistician did not table the 1988 household survey, as we did not have the power to do anything about it. I can only assume that he did not table that survey because he knew that it was far bigger and far more onerous than it had been in the past. As to whether it is significantly different from the previous surveys, I think the biggest and most significant difference is that this survey was compulsory and the others were voluntary. That is an enormous difference, for a start. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to flag that I hope to get sufficient support tomorrow to move a motion to bring in a Bill to make it mandatory for the Statistician to table his proposals in both Houses if he wants to make these surveys compulsory and to have those proposals subject to disallowance, in part or in full, by either House of Parliament within five sitting days of their tabling. However, that is not what I got up to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time on 29 September I asked the Minister for Finance, representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-and I am very pleased that the Minister for Finance is sitting in the chamber at the moment-whether he was aware that the Federal Government was helping to fund a job training course in which the long term unemployed build card houses, lie on the floor to meditate and pretend to be blind in public parks. The course also involves basic sex lessons which these unemployed people-some of them family people in their forties-find highly embarrassing and which are of no use at all in helping them to find jobs. They certainly were, and probably still are, taught how to judge people's auras by using wire coathangers as divining rods. The course, which runs for up to four months, is definitely being held on the Gold Coast and, I believe, at several places in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 September I asked whether the Government was going to take steps to stop this ridiculous program. The Minister replied that he would make further inquiries about it. However, I have heard nothing further from him, and I asked that question two months ago. I ask the Minister: When he is speaking on Estimates Committee C, will he answer my original question? I would like to make public the extent of the Federal Government's contribution to this crazy course, which is run at the human resources centre at Southport. Actually, I am a member of Estimates Committee F, not Estimates Committee C. I asked this question in Estimates Committee F because other human resources centre-type programs, such as work ventures and other things, are going on. I found out that some of these programs are being run by the Department of Community Services and Health and some are being run by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The human resources centre about which I asked the question is being funded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I hope that the Minister will give me a proper answer to that question during this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the motion that is before the Committee at the moment because I am concerned at the erosion of so many of the decencies of Australian life and many of the courtesies that have taken place under this Government, not to say the abrogation of basic rights of citizens in the community. About an hour ago Senator Messner was talking about the way in which the Australian Taxation Office was behaving. I do not need to amplify that. The matter before us at the moment concerns the conduct of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in regard to the household expenditure survey, which has been quite outrageous. I do not want to debate with Senator Walsh the story he put to the chamber half an hour ago. I have always had a high regard for Senator Walsh's intelligence; it stands out as a shining beacon amongst all the donkeys on his side of the chamber, but he really cannot have thought about what he was saying. He must have been operating in some logic-tight compartment of his mind to have come up with so many inconsequential inconsistencies. The story did not hang together. The simple test for Senator Walsh is not to go along to the Attorney-General's Department for an opinion. After all, it advised us on that $40m lemon of the referendum a couple of months ago, when it was done like a dinner along with the Government. All he has to do is read the current household expenditure survey and the one that immediately preceded it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think anyone in this Parliament, irrespective of party, would be prepared to engage counsel from the Department. Be that as it may, all Senator Walsh has to do is read the current household expenditure survey and the one that immediately preceded it to see that they are two totally different papers. I do not wish to debate this issue. All I want to do is put on the record, further to what Senator Teague said, some correspondence that went to one of my constituents from Mr Giles, who is the Assistant Statistician. I quote from the letter. Mr Giles said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Strictly speaking the ABS is not required by law to table in Parliament a survey which is a repeat of a previously tabled survey and which has not undergone any significant change. However I am very conscious of the burden placed on respondents to answer the survey question and fill out the diary. I therefore plan to table the survey in the Autumn session of parliament probably sometime in March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>If that course had been followed we would not be in the mess we are in today, but the matter is irrelevant in the sense that the survey is quite different and therefore should have been tabled. I have a couple of questions for the Minister. Before I leave the household expenditure survey, I ask the Minister whether the questionnaires and the diaries from the 1984 survey have been destroyed. It is my understanding that as at December last year these documents had not been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise relating to the Bureau of Statistics is the fact that one of my staff is currently being obliged, to put it politely, and harassed, to put it in more direct language, to cooperate with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in regard to a survey requesting information on hours worked, overtime, pay scales, and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has nothing to do with the Attorney-General's Department. Each time the Bureau's representative calls there seems to be an additional question asked on a one-off basis. During the last interview this related to superannuation. On being asked whether she had superannuation and what kind-that is, work based or private-she asked the ABS representative whether this was part of a tabled survey. It was only after that question was put to the ABS that she was informed that no, it was not but it would like the information. She then asked about the questions and was told that they included a question inquiring of respondents who answered no, they did not have superannuation, why they did not have it. She was told that information of this nature was very important for the Government to have. This raises three points: first, the legality of the additional one-off questions which are being incorporated into the routine questions asked at each interview; secondly, why survey respondents are not being told before they are asked the additional questions that they are not obliged to answer them; and, thirdly, the use of the Bureau by the Government to obtain information for the Government on this sort of one-off basis. We have heard a lot of criticism in this chamber in recent months of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about its methods and about the way the Government is using the Bureau. The Bureau has become a policy tool for the Government and it is time its activities were reviewed. Its activities over the last couple of years are casting quite a large shadow over the commendable work it has done in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish firstly to clarify for the people listening what this debate is all about. I can do it very briefly. A household expenditure survey is at present being conducted throughout Australia by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Opposition believes that that survey is illegal because it believes it is a new survey that was not tabled before both Houses of Parliament. It is being conducted as a compulsory survey by the Government. The Government has said that it is legal because similar surveys have been conducted in the past and that it is not a new survey. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) told us today some rigmarole as to what he believes is a misunderstanding by the Opposition of the legal situation, of the legalities that the Bureau of Statistics is relying on. Senator Walsh said that we are misinformed, that we think the Bureau is relying on the 1973-74 and the 1974-75 surveys but that it is really relying on the 1984 survey. That is the gist of what the Minister said, but nothing could be further from what the Bureau tells us. Let me trace the matter back a little. On 27 June we all received a letter from Mr Castles. Indeed, Mr Castles put out a news release. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Household Expenditure Survey to be conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1988-89 was an official survey which would collect information under the authority of the Census and Statistics Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA> `All proper processes have been followed. The forthcoming survey will have the same purpose, and virtually the same content, as that conducted in 1984. In no way could it be regarded as a new proposal for the collection of information. The tabling document relating to the earlier survey applies in toto to the purpose and content of the 1988-89 survey, and the requirements of the statistics legislation have therefore been fully met,'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This might be what Senator Walsh has picked up. That is what I read, and I asked the Clerk of the Senate to give me an opinion on whether that was the legal framework that would make this 1988 survey the legitimate survey that the Government claims it to be. The reply I got was, `No, it would not. The 1984 survey was a one-off survey and, therefore, it would not make legal the 1988-89 survey'. I went public on that and made people aware that indeed I believed the survey was not legal and that if they did not want to answer the questions they should tell the interviewers that it was not considered legal by the Opposition. Mr Castles then wrote a letter to the Clerk of the Senate in which he said that the Clerk of the Senate had no right to give legal opinion on the 1984 survey being the starting point for the legality of the 1988-89 survey. I shall read from his letter:</PARA>
<PARA> In short, his-</PARA>
<PARA>the Clerk was the author of the opinion I got-</PARA>
<PARA>starting point is that the ABS relied on the tabling of the 1984 Household Expenditure Survey in deciding that there was no legal requirement that the 1988-89 Survey be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>this is a total misconception, says Mr Castles-</PARA>
<PARA> The tabling of the 1984 Survey is not relied upon by the Bureau, because that Survey was not a ``new proposal''. As the former Australian Statistician, Dr R. J. Cameron, stated in his minute of 24 November 1983-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Castles goes on-</PARA>
<PARA>to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer forwarding the proposal:</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant legislative provision Section 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975-calls for the tabling of `new' statistical proposals. Strictly speaking, the proposed survey is not `new' since similar surveys were conducted in respect of the financial years 1974-75 and 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Castles says very clearly that the 1974-75 and 1975-76 surveys were the ones that they were relying on. He said in his defence, because I had used his news release and his letters to us:</PARA>
<PARA>My news release of 27 June was produced quite literally in less than 10 minutes. I received late in the afternoon of that day a copy of a news release by the Hon. A. S. Peacock, MP, Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Treasurer which included the statement `The Government has failed to table the relevant documents in both Houses of Parliament so it is open to question if the ABS has the necessary power to compel families to participate in that survey'. I thought it desirable to make it clear without delay that the matter was not open to question and that all proper processes had been followed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was his excuse for the news release he put out saying that he was relying on the 1984 survey. He resiled from that in his letter to the Clerk. He resiled from that in his letter to me. He then relied on the 1974-75 and 1975-76 surveys. So I have no idea where Senator Walsh got all that rubbish from but I can assure him that Mr Castles has given us full documentation on what he believes the ABS relied upon for the legality of that survey. It certainly was the 1984 survey until he came out very clearly and resiled from it saying it was not appropriate for him to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon asked two specific questions. The answer to the first one is very simply that the diaries and other documents for 1984 have been destroyed. On the second question, the officers here know nothing about that survey and even if they were involved in it it would be difficult to give an opinion without knowing the specific questions and so on. However, I will try to give an answer in writing later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, of course, will not accept the motion. It will be much less obnoxious than it was with the amendment Senator Haines is going to put up, which the Government will support. The motion asserts that this survey is illegal, which is contrary to the advice that we have had from the Attorney-General's Department on at least two occasions. It is particularly objectionable under these circumstances. It is also objectionable because in the preamble it says that the ABS should not proceed with the 1988-89 household expenditure survey. That is not the Government's view; the Government's view is that it is very important that survey proceed because it provides the basis for a great deal of subsequent economic policy. We will certainly vote against the motion that has been moved. I note, however, that the motion expresses an opinion and therefore it has no legal teeth in it: the survey can proceed regardless of whatever opinions may be expressed about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh may well be right that the Government will not necessarily take any notice of the motion that obviously will be put and won in this chamber tonight. But the Government will have to take notice, and I hope it will be pretty soon, of the Ombudsman's report. The Ombudsman will bring down, I hope before we get up in a couple of weeks time, a report on many matters. He has written to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) asking it to get a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department on whether the retrospective tabling of the household expenditure survey makes that survey legal. He has also asked a number of other questions. I received a letter from him which stated that he had read the Hansards of Estimates Committee C and what was said by the Attorney-General's Department. Following the reading of the Hansards he put a number of issues to the Bureau of Statistics to which he has asked it to reply. Let me read those issues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) whether the original 1988 HES should have been tabled before its implementation;</PARA>
<PARA>That is just the question we are asking in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether some interviewers and ABS should be counselled against over-zealous or officious assertion that the original 1988 HES was compulsory;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) whether consideration should be given to payment of compensation to persons compelled to participate in an HES;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) whether the ABS Act and the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (CS Act) should be amended to clarify their operation and/or be combined into one statute;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) whether the Attorney-General's Department-</PARA>
<PARA>listen to this, Mr Temporary Chairman-</PARA>
<PARA> was given misleading or insufficient instructions when its opinion on the need for the tabling of the original 1988 HES was being sought. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we know that that was being sought by the ABS. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) whether the ABS assertion that the original 1988 HES was not new, `being virtually identical' to earlier surveys, was misleading;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) whether the ABS assertions that the Attorney-General's Department's advice justified the original 1988 HES were misleading;</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) whether the ABS is correctly advising the public as to the operations of section 11 of the CS Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (ix) whether the ABS assertions that the tabling of the tabled 1988 HES makes the original 1988 HES compulsory are misleading;</PARA>
<PARA>He has also asked about the confidentiality of survey data and the advice his office should give regarding enquiries from members of the public concerned about their obligations to take part in the 1988 household expenditure survey.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman is extremely concerned about the fact that the Department is going ahead with a survey that so much doubt has been expressed about. Many constituents have contacted us, telling us that they have been threatened by interviewers with a $100 a day fine unless they answer the questions. We have been given letters written to constituents saying to them, `Back in August when we asked you to fill in this survey, you refused. Now that we have tabled the survey it makes it thoroughly legal'. It is wrong that those letters have been written. It was admitted in the Estimates Committee hearing that those letters should not have been sent out. But they were sent out, in the name of the Bureau of Statistics. People have been misled all the way down the path. </PARA>
<PARA> During questioning at the Estimates Committee hearing I asked Mr Skinner a certain question. He said, `I do not know where that question is leading me, Senator, so I do not know how to answer it'. It is incredible that a senior departmental officer could say that he does not know how to answer a question I have asked him because he does not know where the question is leading him. All I was asking for was the truth. All I require from any departmental officer in Estimates hearings is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should not tolerate the situation regarding this expenditure survey. The Government has been asked repeatedly-indeed, the motion before the Senate this evening asks the Government-to discontinue the survey until its legality is proven. The Ombudsman is bringing down his report very soon. I ask the Government again and the Minister for Finance, who is at the table, to take action to stop this intrusive survey. The survey questions that have been asked, some of which Senator Baden Teague has itemised this evening, are intrusive. I ask the Minister to make sure that no further interviews are carried out until we get the Ombudsman's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year is the first year that the Department of Defence has conformed to the direction of the Department of Finance to present its estimates in program management form. The Department was given a one-year deferment to comply with this direction, unlike most other Federal departments. Looking at the way the Department's estimates were presented, one would have to doubt the sincerity of the Department's attempt to comply with the directive of the Department of Finance. Program budgeting requires two basic conditions, firstly that the objectives for each section be set out and, secondly, that performance indicators be drawn up so that measurements can be made as to how the department is performing in pursuit of its objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Estimates hearings this year not one performance indicator was given by the Department of Defence. This, given the normal reluctance of the Department of Defence to give free and happy advice as to how things are going, makes the job very difficult. I know that Senator Ray would agree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department hides to an enormous degree behind the need for secrecy. The reality is that there is very little secret material in the Department of Defence. The performance characteristics of most of the high technology weapons systems et cetera that we are involved with are well known to the Soviets and anyone else who takes an interest. There is an argument for secrecy to be maintained on a few issues but it relates only to a minority of activities of the Department. It certainly cannot be applied, as it has been by the Department, to the whole range of activities in which it is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Department's objectives were defined reasonably well, though a number of them were defined in a rather woolly way. That applies to some of the objectives which were sheltered behind statements that they were objectives that were defined in the defence White Paper brought down last year. But it was the lack of any performance indicator which made judgment of the Department's performance very difficult, if not impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that it is very hard in a defence department to make comparisons with normal commercial enterprises. One cannot run a defence force the way one would run an airline, a shipping line or a bank. One requires excess capacities to make up for search requirements for casualties and other demands that one cannot foresee. But we did not get one word from the Department that the system it was required to work to was inappropriate for it. My view is that it is inappropriate to impose the program management system dogmatically or doctrinally upon the Department. I instance the experience of countries such as Canada, the United States and some of the European countries which, 10 or 15 years ago, applied program management to their departments. They have now moved away from that system because they saw its shortcomings. I am not impressed with program management for this Department. I would rather see some other system. The Parliament needs to know what money is proposed to be spent and how effectively it has been spent. That is all that we require. We are not hung up as to what system is followed to deliver that information to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways the Department's appearance at the recent Estimates hearings was one of the must unsatisfactory appearances by the Department for many a long year. We certainly got some significant information from the Department. We learned, for example, of the failure of the Government to consult with the RAAF before it brought in the disastrous pilot retention bonus scheme which has cost the taxpayer $11m for no benefit whatsoever. Those of us on the Committee know that it was something worked up in blind panic by the two Ministers to cope with the huge loss of pilots from the RAAF in the last three years. There has been some obfuscation of the point put out by the Ministry on this, such as that it had been done with the approval of the RAAF. We found out, on questioning, that the matter of a pilot retention bonus had been discussed with the Air Force two or three years back. Certainly, the proposal that was introduced this year was just dropped on it on the basis of `take it or leave it; we are going to do it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to know how many consultants were employed by the Department of Defence. I see in the papers that were distributed afterwards that the Department simply cannot tell us how many consultants were employed in the last 12 months. The answer from the Department reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Department uses a wide range of services that might be described as consultants. These include services provided from, and controlled by, other departments (e.g., architects). The information needed to answer the Senator's question is not maintained centrally and it would take some time and necessitate the expenditure of significant resources to prepare. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an evasive answer, to put it in the kindest way. The Department knows very well how many consultants, such as Mr Cooksey, it did employ. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense a lot of the information the Parliament is being given from estimates presented in this form is a collection of disjointed facts. It is also true that we get those disjointed facts because they are the questions that honourable senators on the Senate Estimates committees ask. Part of the problem flows from the system that is imposed on us under this program budgeting system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department and the Ministry must take the Parliament into their confidence in relation to defence and defence expenditures. Defence is absolutely fundamental to any society. It is the first duty of a government. It is also a very expensive task. By putting a cloak of secrecy around the activities of the Department and the Defence Force, one does not create an informed, educated public. If one does not create an informed, educated public, one does not have public support for the high expenditures that are involved. The Parliament has to be taken into the confidence of the Department and the Ministry a great deal more. The Parliament has to have information to oversight what is going on, because in defence we are dealing with projects where the expenditure is not in the tens of millions of dollars but, in many cases, in the hundreds of millions of dollars or even thousands of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarine program that we have embarked on was written at about $3.8 billion in prices of two years ago. When the program is completed it will cost the Australian taxpayer somewhere around $10 billion to $12 billion. It is a huge expenditure. It is the biggest contract we have written. One cannot get any information out of the Department of Defence as to how the submarine program is going at present. No-one will tell me at an Estimates Committee hearing. Yet we know very well from other sources that there are very considerable technical problems that are hazarding the success of the program. We know that there are very considerable cost overruns, from the information that is coming out from the people involved. Nothing is put on the record by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an intolerable situation. Not only is there this big amount of money involved in many defence contracts, but the importance of it to the basic security of Australia cannot be overestimated. Things we buy today in the way of major equipment dictate what sort of defence response we can make not in five or 10 years time but maybe in 20 or 25 years time. We close off a lot of options every time we sign a contract. We lose a great degree of flexibility. The Parliament has to have an oversight of how these contracts are going so that we can make some judgment as to whether things are on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to another point. The Estimates committees provide oversight to only a limited degree. When we get onto a big program, such as the submarine contract, it is very hard to run a high level, fully comprehensive audit as to what is happening. Certainly, audits are done by the Auditor-General with respect to making sure that no-one is thieving, stealing or doing dishonest things like that. But there is no independent body set up by the Parliament, which really is the client, to assess how the program is going, whether it is on time, whether it is on budget, what the technical problems are and, importantly, what the technical relevance of it is. The submarine program requirements were drawn up maybe six years back. By the time the first one is built, at least 10 years will have elapsed since pen was first put to paper. It may be that the technical relevance of some of the equipment, some of the weapons system, has changed enormously. We in the Parliament have no way of knowing how appropriate those things are. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the central point of the Estimates Committee, that is, to provide accurate information, particularly on programs of capital procurement. Yesterday I raised the matter of Project Parakeet and the way one of the officers of the Department misled the Parliament in that inconsistent advice was given in two consecutive Estimate Committee hearings-the Estimates Committee hearing in April this year and the one in October. What action does the Government propose to take with respect to that officer?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just say in general, with regard to Senator MacGibbon's comments, that I had to make reference in this chamber once before to the way Senator MacGibbon approaches Estimates committees. It is an example to many of those opposite. He asks his detailed questions, and when the answers come in he summarises them here and puts his own views. I must say that that is the essence of the Estimates committees. I congratulate him on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator MacGibbon required me to reply to only one specific point. I am advised of the following: the transcript of 21 April shows that some problems in areas identified by honourable senators and in other areas were acknowledged but these were exaggerated. The news release of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) of 30 June 1988 and the transcript of 10 October 1988 show that the problems raised by honourable senators were not the reasons for changing the acquisition strategy for the project. The transcript of 21 April shows that the matter was under consideration by the Government at that time, which is clearly indicative of the need for a review of the project. In the event, the Government chose to proceed in the manner foreshadowed by honourable senators but for reasons other than those claimed by the honourable senators, as outlined in the Minister's news release. Given that public statements cannot pre-empt the decision of elected governments and Ministers, it is hard to see what else might have been said or that the Committee was mislead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to touch upon a question that will be debated at length next week. In the context of appropriations, it is appropriate that we talk to, or at least clear the air a little about, the question of defence service homes. I imagine that, perhaps prematurely, there is something built into these appropriations anticipating that the legislation which will be before the Senate next week will be carried and, therefore, that has obviously had to be built into the planning.

However, I would like to air at the moment, on behalf of constituents, some of the reservations that have been raised, and perhaps pose one or two questions which the Minister may be able to clarify for us. For instance, it is a little uncertain as to how many contenders there were for this prize. I think it is generally recognised that it is a considerable prize, but it has never been quite clear what process occurred to arrive at the decision of Westpac as the winner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I was premature. I think that those who will be affected by the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill to be debated next week are curious as to some of the processes that have given rise to Westpac being the winner of this considerable prize. I am wondering whether the Minister might be able to indicate very briefly what the nature of that selection process was, how many competitors there were, and perhaps what criteria led to Westpac eventually taking up this offer. I am aware of the fact that it lay on the table unattended for quite some time. I believe that some controversy is arising as to whether the scheme will be extended to the post-1985 borrowers. An amendment moved by the Opposition in the House of Representatives which perhaps would have had that effect was defeated, and I understand that the proposition will be before the Senate next week. So there are a number of questions about the process, the anticipated costs associated with it, and the degree to which the scheme will be finally carried-I imagine in the next financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to place upon record some of the reservations that borrowers who will be affected by this transfer have expressed. I was involved in fairly extended discussion on radio two or three mornings ago whereby we pacified at least some of the reservations, which I think resulted from the fact that people had received letters which assumed that they would be required to do certain things even before the legislation had been enacted. Some of their reservations concern whether or not interest rates will vary on them and whether or not they will find themselves having to make payments inconveniently at locations some distance from where they presently make them. In all, they may appear on the surface to be superficial reservations, but they are nevertheless quite genuine concerns. I will read some very brief extracts from some of the letters of concern. For instance, one reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I have received letters from the DSH Corpn and Westpac requesting action on a proposal that has yet to become law. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told I will not be inconvenienced-just an 80 km round trip to a Westpac branch as opposed to a 1 km walk to the local post office agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westpac letter requests various personal details that they should get from the DSH Corpn. When I wanted bridging finance, Westpac was then not interested in me. I am not interested in Westpac now. Their form begins ``I/we wish to transfer . . . to the following branch of Westpac'' and requires a signature. </PARA>
<PARA>This person says:</PARA>
<PARA>I DO NOT wish to transfer, and if the legislation is passed it is up to the DSH Corpn to make the change mandatory and without my request and/or signature and/or concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that insurance arrangements etc will have to be conducted with the Government-without any inconvenience, of course. Just two agencies to deal with instead of one. </PARA>
<PARA>That was typical of the sorts of reservations which have been expressed concerning the transfer. Another letter says:</PARA>
<PARA> I am in receipt of a letter from the Westpac corporation stating their intention of taking over our war service affairs from the Defense Homes Corporation to which I am strongly opposed. Our experiences with the Defence Service Homes business has been considerate and helpful. Our men gave so much of themselves for their country and that should continue to be recognised, leaving affairs as they have been. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter likewise expresses further reservations. These letters are typical of the sorts of concerns people have, not so much about the final outcome of the transfer but about the fact that it was premature and that it was taken for granted that it would occur, and they are uncertain as to what the circumstances have been in relation to the winning of this prize and how far it will be carried. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten those who might soon find themselves affected by this transfer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean has raised a couple of issues. I think he wants to know virtually what the names of the tenderers are and the conditions, et cetera. He will realise that I am not about to release commercial, in-confidence information. The tenderers were told at the time that their names and the contents of their submissions would be kept confidential. I am sure there is no inference that in some way this Government favoured Westpac Banking Corporation on the basis of our close working relationship with it over the past 30 years!

The Government has given a commitment that there will be no disadvantages to borrowers who might have difficulty making payments in areas where there is a Westpac branch. I do not know whether I have covered all of Senator McLean's questions. He might like to respond and let me know what else he would like to know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his responses to that first series of questions in relation to the defence service homes scheme. I would like to touch on another matter. I believe there is some degree of sympathy within the Department of Veterans' Affairs concerning the circumstances of merchant seamen in the Second World War. In fact, I think there is at the moment some deliberation about the need to revisit the Act under which their entitlements are at present administered. I am simply seeking some clarification as to whether there is an acknowledgment in the appropriations that perhaps the Department will see fit to be more generous in its considerations of those who served in the merchant navy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, one has always known informally of the enormous contributions and sacrifices which were made by this arm of the service. It is no secret that for many years now merchant seamen have been dissatisfied with their entitlements in comparison with those who receive their entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I have had some informal indications that these discrepancies are in fact under consideration and that that will possibly be addressed by a revision of the Act which affects merchant seamen veterans, or perhaps it may be that their entitlements will be absorbed under the Veterans' Entitlements Act itself. The point I am really making is that there is great dissatisfaction, and has been for several decades now, among those who served in the merchant marine service as to what their entitlements are in comparison with those of the remainder of the veterans community. The fact that the floor of every ocean on earth is littered with the remains of merchant ships, great and small, which were deliberately sunk as acts of war is a great but hidden testimony to the merchant navy's enormous service to our nation. It is perhaps a case of `out of sight, out of mind' that it has been necessary for their case to be documented so graphically and to be presented repeatedly to the Minister in an attempt to achieve some degree of equality. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record the fact that the Australian Democrats have made representations on quite a number of occasions on behalf of merchant seamen. I remind the Committee of the degree to which they see themselves discriminated against and the wide degree of entitlement discrepancy which exists between those who are entitled under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and those who are entitled under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The following facts concerning some of the conditions which Australian merchant seamen lived and operated under during the Second World War appear to be the basis upon which that resentment is based: merchant seamen's rate of pay was considerably less than that to which other servicemen were entitled at that time. They were not issued with uniforms. There were no regular qualified medical services available to them. No medical checkup was given to merchant seamen upon discharge from their ships. The bulk of Australian merchant seamen served on foreign allied ships. This was due to the small number of Australian vessels in service. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian merchant mariners come under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, and this Act differs greatly from the Repatriation Act, as I have said, in that the former Act places the onus on the claimants to prove their injury or disability. In many instances this injury or disability was war caused. Only a few thousand Australian merchant seamen served in the Second World War. They ask the question: why were they discriminated against by coming under a different Act? All Australian service personnel, they argue, should be provided for under the Repatriation Act. We believe that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is currently rethinking its attitude towards this discrimination due to the administration of entitlement under two separate Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The servicemen argue that they were not welcomed home, as were members of the other Australian armed services. That is the sort of grievance which underlaid the resentment, until recently, of those who had served in Vietnam. They claim that they were not deprogrammed after the war. Many of them still live with the consequences of not having gone through-to use their expression-a `deprogramming'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted that Vietnamese, American and other allied ex-service personnel living in Australia are eligible for war service pensions and full repatriation benefits, but that the seamen are not. They see that as a clear act of discrimination against them. Statutes to remove discrimination of all types are being proclaimed throughout Australia; yet they, as merchant seamen of the Second World War, believe that, because they come under a separate repatriation Act, they are clearly being discriminated against for the reasons I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> They say that they were a fighting service, as most wartime merchant ships were armed and the defensively equipped merchant ships gunner in the British or Australian navies was seconded to merchant vessels for the purpose of training ships' crews in the proficient use of heavy and light armaments. They say that the services provided by the merchant navy in the conveyance of troops, fuels, ammunition and other war essentials contributed significantly to the allied forces' victory. Accordingly, they simply request that they be viewed as having made the same contribution as those who served in other branches of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> Merchant navy personnel served in the following theatres of war: Russian convoys, Pacific islands, Malta, Dunkirk, Sicily, Normandy, North Atlantic, Coral Sea, Middle East, New Guinea, Manila Bay and Tokyo. It is on these grounds, therefore, that there is a deep feeling of resentment among those who served in the merchant seamen services. It is as an expression of that resentment that I pose to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) the question: Is the Department of Veterans' Affairs anticipating-as we believe it may be-some variation or amendment to the Act within the next financial year whereby the objections of merchant seamen will be accommodated, and their entitlements varied and accommodated, within the appropriations?</PARA>

Senator McLean equated the return of merchant marines after the Second World War with the reception accorded to Vietnam veterans when they returned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted tonight to raise a couple of matters in relation to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs that were the subject of debate in the hearings of Estimates Committee E. I thought that the handling by departmental officials and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) in the Estimates Committee hearing of these matters was very good. It was an example that could well be adopted by some other departments so far as the quality of the preparation of notes for Estimates committees was concerned. I thank them for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the matters which we raised in particular during the Estimates debate-and one on which, having now re-read the Hansard transcript of the debate, I think the Government had the better of the duel-was the question of whether the Department has been setting targets or quotas for various posts around the world over the last couple of years. There was a very interesting debate on that aspect. As I understand it, without going into all the details of the debate, the Department finally told us that targets were not set and that staffing at the various immigration posts, at our diplomatic offices around the world, was not pre-determined but was based very significantly on the number of applications and the demand coming out of each post. In other words, the staffing situation was demand driven rather than the reverse. Subsequently, in response to questions that we asked about this matter, some very interesting and useful figures came forth in terms of the staffing of posts with immigration officials, both locally engaged staff and with the Australian based staff, and a corresponding set of data as to the extent of the backlog existing in applications at the different posts. On the basis of the information and the data provided, there have been major staffing increases in the following posts so far as locally engaged staff are concerned: China, Chile, Fiji, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Syria, Thailand and the USA. So far as Australian based staff are concerned, there has been an increase of two or more positions in the posts in Hong Kong, Malaysia and I think Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA> Those increases were accompanied by significant falls in the following posts in the locally engaged staff: West Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. The falls of Australian based staff occurred mainly in West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Yugoslavia. So the conclusion in terms of staffing is that the main rises have occurred in Asian and South American countries and the main falls have occurred in European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we look at the backlog of applications, it is interesting to note that the countries that have the main backlogs of applications include-this is not all inclusive-the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and some of the European posts I mentioned before. In other words it would appear that, particularly so far as some of the European, North American and British posts are concerned, there have been falls in the staff, both locally engaged and Australian based, despite the fact that there have been significant backlogs of applications in those places. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like an explanation from the Minister if he is able to give it now-if he is not he can take it on notice again-as to the basis of determining the staff level at posts around the world, because I do not believe that the figures that have been given to us support the proposition that was made in the Estimates Committee hearing that the staffing at the posts is demand driven. I would appreciate an answer on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These matters are not always as simple as they appear on paper. Delays and backlogs are caused for a whole variety of reasons. In some parts of the world delays occur through the propensity for forgeries. In others it depends on the nature of those applying. For instance, if people are applying in a country whose people have a propensity to apply under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act there are also long delays for testing. I have maintained, and I continue to maintain, that the staffing of overseas posts is on the basis of demand and previous successful applications. It is not easy to allocate staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inference that was made earlier, that we had targets almost in terms of quotas, is not true. It was basically circulated around for political reasons to protect another position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is a misinterpretation. What I am asking is this: Are you not in fact setting targets or quotas for various posts before the staffing levels are determined?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the evidence at the Estimates Committee was that two different systems have been used, that one had been trialled and then almost reversed. We are now very much in a position to allocate staff according to what we think the demand will be. The field of immigration has always had backlogs, going back almost to the year dot. It is something that I think only technology and a rational points system will be able to assist, with quick processing. That is something I do not think any government has had in the last two decades. But I assure Senator Short that there is no intention within my Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or at my ministerial direction to favour one region of the world over another; no intention whatsoever. I would not tolerate such a situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the honourable senator wants to go into a detailed discussion about why there are two staff in one spot or three in another, I am not in a position to do so here in the Committee of the Whole. We might take that up in the Estimates Committee that considers the Supplementary Estimates. If the honourable senator wants to give some notice of that, I will certainly have the information available at the next Estimates Committee meeting and we will have the matter out, because I look forward to that discussion as much as he does. But I again give him this assurance: there is no manipulation of overseas staff figures to get an outcome. That is not the way to run a global immigration policy. A global immigration policy is run by saying that there will be an even hurdle worldwide. It is selective, of course-selective towards age, skills and concessional points on the basis of kinship. All of those things will apply, but they will apply equally the world over. The fact that the rest of the world is not equal, of course, does not mean that a necessary response is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable senator referred to Italy and to the fact that there has been a reduction in Rome. On my looking at those figures, there are something like 2,800 applications in Rome in 1987-88, of which I think 1,300 were accepted. But at least 1,200 of those were in the refugee special humanitarian region. We had a staff cutback in Rome because of the very severe cutback in demand. From my memory only 600-odd people applied under independent concessional and I think 300 under direct family reunion. Therefore in those sorts of posts we would cutback over a period. We would also have to take into account that in a place like Rome we might not cut back as much as might appear necessary due to demand because of the complexity of a lot of those cases. A lot more work is involved in processing the refugees there. We process the Soviet Jewry mostly out of Rome. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions in countries vary and the needs of the clients vary. It may well be that we can at times cut back in Great Britain because the cases there are simpler to process. I stress again that there can be delays through things like the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act where there is, I admit, up to a 40-week delay. That is something that is being reviewed by the Department of Industrial Relations right now. It is something my Department has obviously continually complained about as it wants it to be resolved. There are quite often infinite patterns of reasons as to why we get these variations. In two or three other capital cities of the world-I do not want to identify them here particularly-processing time is extremely long because of the number of forgeries-forged qualifications, documents, et cetera-that are received. They all have to be sifted through. In other areas the amount of staff we have overseas has absolutely nothing to do with immigration; it is to do with the issuing of visas for visitors. If a certain region of the world surges in terms of visitors, we are more likely to have officers there to deal with those applications and not just immigration matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing simple about this area. If the honourable senator wants a post by post assessment and comparison to test whether the explanation given to him at the Estimates Committee is right, I suggest that we do it in our consideration of the Supplementary Estimates. If he will give us some notice, I will get the officers along. If we have to do a post by post review and give a rationale for why the staffing levels at a particular post are such, I am happy to do so. </PARA>

First, the Minister will recall responding to one of my questions in the Estimates Committee in relation to the accreditation of business migration agents and whether State government instrumentalities ought to be accredited as agents in competition with other people. When the criticism was raised by him and others-quite unfairly, I thought-concerning a member of parliament being associated with a business migration agency, the Minister agreed to take on board the point as to whether State government instrumentalities ought to be accredited because of the argument that could be made that they are in a privileged position as well. Has the Minister given any further thought to that?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, what is the timing now of the Government's official response to the report of the FitzGerald Commission of Inquiry to advise on Australia's immigration policies, and will that response be tabled in the Parliament before it rises? Thirdly, I raise a matter relating to the imam of Sydney's Lakemba mosque, about whom there has been a great deal of comment in recent times, particularly following his extraordinary outbursts of an anti-Semitic nature in a recent address at Sydney University. He has been a very controversial figure for several years, and in 1985 one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr Hurford, wrote to the imam accusing him of holding a deep-seated contempt for basic Australian values and attitudes. I understand that the imam is still in Australia on a temporary visa, and has been for several years. Assuming that is the case, I would like to know how that is happening and what action is being taken in any form to regularise what appears to be a very irregular and illegal situation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short raises three matters. The first one deals with the propriety, or the future, of State government instrumentalities being involved in the business migration program. That is a matter I intend to raise with State governments at the next ministerial council meeting. There has not been one between the time of the Estimates Committee hearings and now. I will certainly have the matter listed on the agenda, but I will not pursue that now, unless there are further questions on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Short made a throw-away remark that I was critical of an honourable senator for being involved in this area. I think that that was somewhat distorted at the time. I hope that even the other senator accepts that, because I did not leak the story. I think Senator Short accepts that. When I was asked about it I pointed to a potential conflict of interest-that is, if one were a business migration agent touring through a lot of countries, the appellation of senator would bring the accusation of a conflict of interest. At no stage did I say that there would be a conflict of interest and I believe I put on the public record my view of the integrity of that honourable senator. Nevertheless, that would have been a perceived conflict of interest and would have been a matter for complaint from other business migration agents. I also put on the record here that I also understand why some honourable senators wish to keep their hand in in their old occupations. This point was clearly illustrated today during the obituary for Senator Little. Only two senators who served with him are still here, yet he left this place only 14 years ago. I do not criticise honourable senators who want to keep their eye in in an alternative occupation. With the hazards of election and preselection haunting us all, that is not unusual. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question raised by Senator Short is a particularly sensitive one and he will note that I have made no public comment on it. He may adduce reasons of cowardice or otherwise for not making a public comment, but I will not comment today on the specifics of that particular individual. I can confirm that that individual is in Australia on a temporary entry permit which expires in June 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approximately four years, I believe. I think he has had two temporary entry permits. At the time of the expiration of the permit, or before, that individual has to make a decision whether to apply again for a temporary entry permit or a change of residence status, or leave the country. At that time, I, as the final decision maker, will make any decisions appropriate to the case. If I were to prejudge that issue in advance of that time or make detrimental or supportive statements, I would find myself in court. I recommend that Senator Short look at a couple of the legal cases involving Immigration Ministers over the last three or four years and at the judgments involved. I think that would quite clearly demonstrate to him why I do not make public statements on these particular cases. I am the final decision maker and any court would expect me not to make a decision on the basis of representations. It would expect me to make a long and considered judgment based on the facts of the case of the time, which I will do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask the Minister whether he could look into a matter which has caused me some concern. When I was in a parliamentary delegation whose members were guests of the Italian Government earlier this year, we were continually asked whether Australia was either discriminating against Italians or in some way not providing sufficient access to Italian people to migrate to Australia. That concern tended to be backed up by the figures that I had established some months ago-that in the five years of the Hawke Government there had been something like a 57 per cent reduction in the number of Italian migrants to Australia as against the last five years of the Fraser Government. I understand from the Minister's previous responses that this was largely due to a diminution in the number of applications, and I think Government spokesmen have repeatedly said that the higher level of economic activity in Europe has been the cause of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, when this matter was raised with us in Italy it was pointed out that there was still a considerable level of unemployment in Italy, particularly among those people who had recently finished tertiary education or acquiring skills. For example, people with quite good engineering degrees were available and could be available to be nobbled as migrants to Australia, if we had such a mind to do it. For many of these people there is a wait of something like three years before they have the opportunity to get employment. As I understand it, the points system arrangements that have existed since 1983 exclude such people. Even though there might be engineering graduates from a good university in Milan or Turin-obviously people of some merit and of use to Australia as migrants-the changed arrangements mean that because they have not had a job they do not qualify under the points system. I simply ask whether that situation could be examined to see the extent to which we could get the benefit of the expenditure that the Italian Government has made in training them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the people Senator Michael Baume was talking about do not have relatives in Australia and the reason they cannot qualify is that they do not get any concessional points. They also, because they have had no experience, miss out on points along that line-though not usually a lot. There are alternative methods of migrating. Certainly under employer nomination they could qualify to come to Australia if we had a shortage in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Short has just left. He asked me a question earlier about the timetable for the Government's response to the report of the FitzGerald Commission of Inquiry. It could be next week. We might have to advertise in a lot of countries if we want a large pool from which to choose the very best. The real problem is the lack of experience, which I think even Senator Michael Baume would recognise. With university graduates coming straight out of university it is very hard to pick the good from the bad. I would also suggest that with events such as those that are likely to occur in Europe over the next few years, those people might well want to emigrate to Germany or a similar country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not Senator Robert Ray in particular, but his colleagues in general. In the course of Estimates Committee A I asked a series of questions relating to the overseas trip by Mr Hayden recently which was cut short. It is my recollection that that trip occupied less than 10 days. Mr Hayden was accompanied by his wife and a departmental officer. I was originally given an indication that the cost of that trip was in the order of $23,000. I have now had handed to me-and I regard the timing as strategic and significant-a document which is an addendum to answers to my questions and which indicates that the amount for the trip to date, although it is `possible but not expected', to use the words of the note, that further accounts may come to hand, is a total of $60,397. Of course, the timing is significant because this document could well have been made available to me prior to the Estimates Committee debate and it could well have been provided to me prior to 20 past 7 this evening, the day before the House of Representatives rises. Undoubtedly, it was strategically timed in the hope that it would not come to the attention of those members of the Estimates Committee, and me in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard it as a scandalous exercise. It is quite clear that the Government is intending to cover up the exorbitant cost of this trip. Even allowing a calculation of 10 days for each of three persons, the total for that trip is some $2,000 a day, and accommodation and meals are of the order of $750 a day per person. I just cannot abide that. I call on the Government to explain to the Parliament and to the people of Australia how Mr Hayden and his wife and a departmental officer could possibly have chalked up expenses of that magnitude. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a disgrace. It is quite clear that Mr Hayden was living as high on the hog as one could possible imagine, setting a disgraceful example to those who have to travel overseas and have to stay in reasonable accommodation, and was certainly making the very most of what turns out to be his last overseas trip; and we all recall the controversial circumstances in which he chose to take this trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note in passing-I think the public is already well aware-that Mr Hayden spent virtually no time at all on official business, apart from popping into Buckingham Palace for afternoon tea. The note that I have tells me that he made a call on the Governor of Hong Kong-and presumably that did not cost him anything. He attended a luncheon function in honour of the President of Fiji in New York. I note that we have just given Fiji $10m in overseas aid and I would not have thought that that country would be charging us for that luncheon function, so again presumably that meal was free. In London Mr Hayden had discussions with various dignitories, including the Lord Chamberlain and the Private Secretary to Her Majesty; and he had lunch with Her Majesty the Queen-again, one would have thought, a free lunch. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it beyond belief that Mr Hayden, the Governor-General-designate, and his wife and a departmental officer could possibly have chalked up amounts of this magnitude. I demand a full explanation and a detailed breakdown of these figures and, in particular, an explanation of why these figures could not have been made available over the last several months but were deliberately chosen to be made available at a time when it was hoped that they would not be noticed. Well, they have, and it is a scandal, and I am quite sure that this is yet another example of the improprieties that Mr Hayden has engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like an explanation as to whether he is continuing to pursue his one last effort to take a dollar out of the system with his defamation action in Queensland, for which he got an order for a speedy hearing scheduled to come up in December. I regard it as singularly inappropriate for a person aspiring to assume that office to be, at this very last moment, again seeking money from litigants. Some of us are thin-skinned and resort to litigation at the drop of a hat. We have only to look at the conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the last few days to see evidence of that. But it is quite improper and inappropriate for Mr Hayden to have pursued this matter in the way that he has and to have even sought to have the matter brought on early just so that he can get a few extra bob. I regard that, together with the extravagant expenses of the trip, as quite inappropriate behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to spend a few minutes talking about alternatives to Australia's current defence strategy of self-reliance within the alliance and the changing nature of warfare. This debate is already under way in Europe and, more recently, in New Zealand, so it is about time that we got such a debate under way in the community in Australia. In fact, my office has been instrumental in working with community groups in promoting a series of Just Defence conferences around Australia since 1986. So far we have organised three-in Canberra, Perth and Adelaide. We were fortunate enough to have the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) at two of them and he promised to attend the third, but the Fiji coup, mark 1, intervened and he was represented by an officer on his personal staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other speakers have considered defence options ranging from non-offensive defence and territorial defence through to social defence as well as armed neutrality. I advocate a strategy of transarmament, or a step by step movement away from current policy through non-offensive defence and ultimately to social defence. Such a process would extend beyond my lifetime and would have to be accompanied by the strengthening of regional and international conflict resolution mechanisms as well as far more research on peace and conflict research itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept the idea of armed neutrality, which was the subject of debate in this chamber a few days ago. Obviously, I believe in a nuclear free and independent Australia and have stated frequently that I believe that Australia should sever all military ties with the United States of America or any other major power. For more than 40 years the world has been cursed by bloc thinking when both Moscow and Washington propounded the idea `If you are not for us you have to be against us'. If I criticise the United States, I am somehow pro-Soviet. If I criticise the Soviet Union-which I frequently do, despite allegations to the contrary by certain members of this chamber whose politics I sometimes think lie somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan-I am accused of being pro-American or anti-Soviet. </PARA>
<PARA> I have long argued that middle ranking powers like Australia should de-align themselves by pulling out of this bloc thinking and following the thinking now growing in Europe of a continent free from the military control of both superpowers, though not within the framework of becoming another superpower themselves. What we should be considering is an appropriate form of defence for Australia as we move towards the twenty-first century. I believe that most Australians still support the ANZUS alliance because, for 200 years, they have been taught that this country, with its 24,000-kilometre coastline, is somehow indefensible and threatened from beyond. Because of this fear, we need a great and powerful protector, or so the considered wisdom has been. Until 1942 Britain provided that protection and, after that, we tumbled into the arms of the United States. The United States was not really interested in an alliance after the war, but it suited it after the Korean war broke out when a series of alliances, including one with Japan and one with the Philippines, were constructed down through the Western Pacific to box in the Soviet Union and Red China, as it was then called. </PARA>
<PARA> The other myth that we have to live with is that we are a civilised nation working with other civilised nations which are unfortunately on the other side of the world, while around us there are uncivilised nations and terrorists. We are reminded that wars can break out at any moment and that, if we do not protect ourselves as in the 1930s, we shall be the victims of unprovoked aggression. Great play is made of various Arab-Israeli conflicts and the Falklands-Malvinas conflict in 1982, as recent examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with this attitude is that it fails to address the current world situation and the way in which war has changed, and fails to understand the region in which we live. There have been somewhere between 130 and 150 wars in the world since 1945 and about 20 million people have been killed as a consequence. Conservative politicians in this building like to refer to the deterrent value of nuclear weapons, which they are convinced have kept the peace since 1945 or at least prevented a major confrontation. What they ignore is the fact that, because of the existence of nuclear weapons, the nature of warfare has also changed. As Sinathamby Rajaratnam, a former Singapore Foreign Minister, once put it, the third world war is a cumulation of little wars rather than a big one. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Though the form is new, it is basically a war between the great powers and one fought for the realisation of their ambitions and the promotion of their national interests. However, this is not obvious because in this new world war, the great powers are invisible. </PARA>
<PARA>While we can welcome the apparent impending close of some of these intractable wars such as the Gulf War and the conflicts in the Western Sahara, Angola and Namibia, a recent article in the Canberra Times on a report by the Commission on Integrated Long-term Strategy in the United States referred to discriminate deterrence, indicating that this continuing confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union is likely to continue and intensify. What is worse is the fact that these wars are going to involve new high tech weapons as well as control of space. At the same time, we know that new weapons are being developed in the Third World including chemical weapons, sometimes called the poor person's nuclear weapon; ballistic missiles; and some of the new smart weapons as well as nuclear weapons, thanks to the spread of so-called peaceful nuclear technology. </PARA>
<PARA> What the hardline defence lobbyists in this country fail to realise is that all but one of the wars fought since 1945 have been fought in the Third World. Only 15 per cent of them involved one country invading another. The other 85 per cent have involved the attempted overthrow of colonial governments or have come about for tribal, religious or ethnic reasons, frequently of an internal nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially major conflicts can be divided into six groups: colonial wars, wars of liberation, border wars, invasions, separatism and interventionism. The main colonial wars were fought in Africa but wars of national liberation have been and are being fought across three continents with smaller spasmodic conflicts continuing in Europe. Border wars have invariably had their roots in the colonial period, as have separatist struggles. While it is perfectly true that a number of these conflicts have been and are being fought fairly close to Australia-in places like West Papua, East Timor, Indo-China, the Philippines, Burma and Sri Lanka-the fact is that they all come under the categories I have already outlined and none pose a threat to Australia. What we in fact consider our greatest weakness is our greatest strength; that is, our distance from anywhere else. This was the same factor that persuaded the Imperial Japanese Army not to follow up an invasion option it considered early in 1942, and it is still valid today. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we face in Australia in 1988, as we have indeed had to face since the end of the Vietnam War, is how to have a relevant defence force in peacetime. It is the same problem faced by the Europeans. Usually a defence force exists because there is a threat and the armed forces hold war games and exercises relevant to various threat scenarios. In Australia we have $7.6 billion to spend in a year but no threat, or no immediate threat, visible. It has made life very difficult for the Australian Defence Force and I believe it is this paradox that has partly contributed to low morale in the ADF, which was the subject of a recent defence inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADF is caught between the strange glamour that we attach to the military and retired service men and women in Australia and the realities of peacetime. The only way to counter it for the warrior class is either to drum up the glories of the past when we went off to fight other nations' wars, or to invent implausible threats. There are quarrels over what new weapons to buy without asking what they are for. Admirals want aircraft carriers and naval officers want sophisticated new frigates to sail around the Pacific and to join the Americans in exercises designed to fight the enemies of the United States on the other side of the world but they have very little to do with non-existent enemies of Australia in the South Pacific. New Zealand has been asking the same question since faced with a potential bill of $NZ2.1 billion for four new ANZAC frigates which are totally irrelevant to the defence requirements of that country, but very few people in Australia have begun to question the relevance of these very expensive and sophisticated weapons or pieces of equipment-the new frigates, the new submarines and the 75 FA18s-which have made such a hole in our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the real threats to Australia at the moment come from illegal fishing, dangers of quarantine infection, illegal immigration, and drug smuggling. We are likely to spend over $5 billion on the FA18s but they are of little use in dealing with these current threats to our security, and we cannot afford adequate surveillance of our coastline, which would cost a fraction of the cost of even one FA18. We discontinued production of the Nomad and spent our money on Orions and the new attack aircraft which we had to buy from another country, the United States. Recently I saw that a joint Indonesian-Spanish patrol type aircraft was being advertised in an Australian defence journal, and a defence commentator referring to the advertisement was reflecting how stupid we were to have discontinued production of the Nomad. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were constructing aircraft like the Nomad here in Australia along with corvettes, more patrol boats, and the minesweepers we are planning to develop, that would be far more relevant than FA18s, submarines and new frigates, let alone the Opposition's wish list for aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines to be paid for somehow by reducing taxation and government expenditure, as the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) reminded the House of Representatives quite recently. What the warrior class fails to realise is that, if Australia invests in potentially offensive weapons, then so will our neighbours. We have a recent example with India. The Government there, for some reason known only to itself but probably connected with prestige and wanting to be a major power in the region, has decided to acquire several nuclear submarines and a third aircraft carrier. Though we are assured that India is not viewed as a threat, there are Royal Australian Navy men who want Australia to get nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers because India is getting them. This is the action-reaction syndrome that fuels an arms race. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that instead of developing a regional arms race Australia would be far better off developing a non-offensive defence force structure, putting more emphasis on the reserves, training our soldiers in peacekeeping skills for service with the United Nations when called on, and, above all, building up their skills for community service within Australia and the region. I believe that this would do a great deal to improve defence morale and give them something meaningful to do and it would improve their perceived value to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> World defence expenditure is continuing to creep upwards but has slowed down with the economic recession. New weapons are being developed by the boffins and are now spreading through the Third World as arms transfers proliferate beyond the control of the old suppliers in the United States and Europe, including the Soviet Union. It is no good bemoaning arms sales and the escalation of the arms race, both internationally and regionally, if we join in. Australia is fortunate to be one of the most secure countries in the world and it is about time that we got over these hang-ups of a past era and put our minds to peace and conflict research rather than preparing for non-existent threats and playing war games in scenarios that are nothing to do with the defence of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate some deficiencies in the social security area which have seen families and pensioners severely disadvantaged. In today's society under this Labor Administration it would appear that the needy and those in poverty have to live within 400 metres of a Department of Social Security office in order to get benefits that I believe they should automatically be entitled to. My State of Tasmania is quite decentralised, with many people living in remote country areas. I have had brought to my attention of late several cases of people having been penalised because they do not live in a situation that is convenient to a Social Security office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One particular matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the Senate tonight is that of a self-employed family man who had the misfortune to become ill. This man's annual earnings would make the salaries of people in this chamber look like those of millionaires. He and his wife and children live in a quiet, remote part of the State. His illness progressed to the extent that eventually it led to hospitalisation. During this time neither he nor his wife had been able to lodge an appropriate form for sickness benefit with the Department of Social Security. After all, his wife was looking after a young family and a very sick husband. It was very difficult for her to get to the nearest town to enable a form to be sent to the Department of Social Security. Apart from that, we seem to assume that all sorts of people have a knowledge and understanding of how the bureaucracy works. But not everybody in society, particularly those who live in remote areas, are aware of their entitlements. Even if they are fit, they are perhaps not as speedy as some others. Because the form ended up being lodged outside the 5-week period specified in the claims guidelines-the man had a viral infection; he was on his back; he got worse and went to hospital-the Department refused to backdate this man's claim. This caused untold hardship to the family. The Social Security Act in section 125 (4) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> If a claim for sickness benefit is not lodged within the time specified in sub-section (3)-</PARA>
<PARA>as mentioned previously, this is five weeks-</PARA>
<PARA>the benefit is payable:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if the Secretary is satisfied that the sole or dominant cause of the failure to lodge the claim within that time was the incapacity concerned-from and including such date as the Secretary considers to be reasonable in the circumstances, not being a date earlier than 4 weeks before the day on which the claim is lodged;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in any other case-from and including the day on which the claim is lodged. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (a) would appear to give the Secretary the necessary discretion in such cases to approve the backdating of the claim. However, in this case the answer was just plain no. There was just a straightforward no from the Department. I believe a little consideration should and could have been given to this person's unusual circumstances. There is verification of his sickness and his hospitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do departments have such a narrow view? They see only black and white, the easy way out. There is no grey area, despite what the Act says, for people in such necessitous circumstances. Why do departments insist on conforming to the so-called guidelines in cases where departmental officers cannot fit a case into the usual categories. This case was not dealt with just at the counter or at the door; it went to the supervisors and such people. So there is no excuse; the Department had the opportunity to look again at this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) as a humanitarian person to do everything in his power to make sure that the Act is applied in a humane way to make sure that what I am sure is the full intent of this section is applied and that at least this person can have the benefit applied for the four weeks. He lived in a remote area; he was hospitalised and he was living substantially below the poverty line. I appeal to the Minister's sense of fairness and judgment and to the Government's sense of fairness. I hope the Minister will do the right thing. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Alston raised a question relating to a matter which was an addendum to information provided to Senate Estimates Committee A to do with the expenses incurred by the Governor-General designate on a recent overseas trip. I want to say only two things on that because obviously I did not have the opportunity to see the paper which was in the possession of Senator Alston. Firstly, I do not think it is fair to say of the officials concerned in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that they were deliberately trying to withhold information from this chamber until the last moment. Obviously, the material has been provided at a time which allows it to be brought to the notice of the chamber: indeed, that has been done by Senator Alston. The detail that he may be in possession of might further clarify the situation. For example, it is obvious that because of the reduction in the duration of Mr Hayden's overseas trip the air fare component would look greater on a per diem basis than it would if the original duration of the trip had applied. So there are elements which I think would require further reflection and consideration. I do not accept the various highly emotive descriptions of the expenditure which fell from the lips of the honourable senator from Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May 1988 (Hansard page 3000), Senator Hamer asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the new arrangements for the taxation of superannuation. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements for the taxation of superannuation which were announced on 25 May, benefits received from an unfunded superannuation scheme, as commonly found in the Commonwealth public sector, will be liable to tax of 15 per cent (plus the Medicare levy) on rollover into an approved deposit fund. However, on withdrawal from the fund the benefits will obtain relief, compared with the previous arrangements, at least sufficient to offset the tax imposed on rollover. There will, therefore, be no diminution of after-tax benefits as a result of this aspect of the new arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 June 1988 (Hansard page 3341), Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the new superannuation taxation provisions. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes to the taxation of superannuation announced in the May Statement included a number of measures which will benefit self-employed persons and `unsupported' employees who make their own provision for superannuation:</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of tax deductible contributions such persons are able to make has been doubled, from $1500 to $3000. This effectively doubles the amount that they can save through a superannuation scheme on a tax concessional basis (ie taxed only at the 15 per cent superannuation fund rate).</PARA>
<PARA> They will also benefit in full from the generosity of the transitional provisions, which provide phased reductions in the tax rates on the post-1983 assessable component of superannuation benefits of 15 percentage points over the 5 years from 1 July 1988. The generosity of the transitional arrangements arises because the reductions in tax overcompensate for the tax on contributions by applying to the whole of the assessable post-1983 component of an ETP, including that part of a benefit relating to the period between 1 July 1983 and 1 July 1988 when no contributions tax was payable, as well as to the earnings on undeducted contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the shift from the old $55000 (unindexed) threshold to the new $60000 indexed threshold for end benefits will also assist persons retiring from 1 July 1988 on.</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, persons retiring in the next 12 to 18 months, irrespective of whether they are employees or self-employed, can generally expect to be marginally better off as a result of the tax changes.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="3237" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 August 1988 (Hansard page 260), Senator Parer asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the reduction in beer prices quoted by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech of 23 August 1988. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer referred to the reductions in the retail prices of beer recommended by the Australian Hotels Association (AHA) which will flow from the taxation changes announced in the Budget. He noted these would be less than those indicated in the Budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimate of the retail price reductions on beer indicated in the Budget speech, ie about $2.20 for a carton of full strength beer and about $5.50 for a carton of lower alcohol beer, were based on, inter alia, the following assumptions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the full strength beer has an alcohol content of 4.9 per cent and the lower alcohol beer has an alcohol content of 2.2 per cent; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that retailers reduce their prices while maintaining the same percentage profit margin as prior to the tax changes.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator raised the question of freight costs. Whether sales tax will be paid on freight costs will depend on marketing arrangements in the industry, which differ in various parts of Australia. This situation is no different to that where other goods are subject to sales tax. Where freight costs are substantial and included in the taxable wholesale sales value, then the net tax payable on the beer will be higher than elsewhere (and the drop in retail price less). However, it was not feasible to present in the Budget speech estimates of the change in retail prices to cover all possible situations.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the reduction in the retail price of beer should significantly exceed the reduction in the Commonwealth taxation impost. The reduction in Commonwealth taxation should also lead, over time, to a reduction in the amount of State licensing fees paid as these fees are set on a percentage basis. In addition, some reduction in the absolute retail margin can be expected as industry advice suggests that margins tend to be set as a percentage of the wholesale price.</PARA>
<PARA> The AHA has recommended retail price reductions of $1.80, and $4.08 on a dozen 750ml bottles of full strength and light beer respectively. There exists scope for further reduction in these prices and the Prices Surveillance Authority has been instructed to monitor beer prices to ensure that consumers receive the full benefits of the Government's reforms in this area. A number of major retailers have already reduced prices by amounts similar to-sometimes larger than-those set out in the Budget and competitive forces are likely to give rise to more widespread reductions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 October 1987 (Hansard page 719), Senator Chaney asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that access to an individual taxpayer's tax file number by persons other than the taxpayer and the Australian Taxation Office has already given rise to difficulties in tax administration? Does (the Minister) agree that, for example, it resulted in the diversion of refund cheques which were payable to people who had access to numbers and used them to obtain the diversion of those refund cheques? Does the Minister accept that general access to tax file numbers can itself be a source of abuse of the tax system?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that simple access to tax file numbers-as would occur for example under the Prescribed Payments System-has not led to abuse of the kind identified in the honourable Senator's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 October 1988 (Hansard page 1257). Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the decision of the Government to replace the $2 note with a $2 coin, is the Minister aware that the pioneers of agriculture are being removed from the Australian currency? In view of this Government's record of continuing high inflation, when the government is considering a $200 note will it arrange for a picture of Farrer, the father of the wheat industry, to be placed on that note in recognition of the industry's role in generating such a high proportion of Australia's export earnings?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button undertook to make inquiries of the Treasurer, who has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no current plans to issue a $200 note.</PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank, which is responsible for the design and production of Australia's currency notes, has been asked to bear Senator Bjelke-Petersen's comments in mind in considering designs for future issues.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the design process for currency notes, the Reserve Bank has a panel of consultants to advise it on designs. A new set of designs for Australian notes has been worked to an advanced stage and the Bank hopes to issue the new series progressively to replace the existing series over the next few years. Aside from the monarch, however, it is most unusual for individuals to be repeated on different series of banknotes.</PARA>
