<PARA>SUMMARY OF THE COMMITTEE'S SCRUTINY</PARA>
<PARA>CASINO CONTROL ORDINANCE 1988 BEING TERRITORY OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND ORDINANCE No. 4 OF 1988 AND MADE UNDER THE CHRISTMAS ISLAND ACT 1958</PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance provides for the establishment of a casino on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to tabling, but not disallowance, of variations the original Agreement; review of decisions; qualifications of the Casino Controller and other persons; filling of vacancies on the Authority; powers of search (including personal search) by inspectors; disclosure of interests and delegation of powers and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister explained that tabling of variations to the Agreement was to ensure disclosure, but did not consider commercial transactions should be subject to disallowance. The Minister clarified jurisdiction of the courts, and a reference to `the Court'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister undertook to amend the Ordinance to set minimum qualifications for the Casino Controller, Deputy and Inspectors, to make the filling of a vacancy on the Authority mandatory, to provide that searches be conducted only by persons with appropriate qualifications, and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted the difficulties associated with implementing previous undertakings relating to the Australian Capital Territory Casino Control Ordinance 1988 and relevant to this Ordinance regarding review of decisions and the suitability test. The Committee accepts the Minister's explanation and undertaking to amend the Ordinance to require the Minister to grant approval if he or she is satisfied the applicants meet the relevant requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>NOISE CONTROL ORDINANCE 1988 BEING AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY ORDINANCE No. 71 OF 1988 AND MADE UNDER THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1910</PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance provides for the control of noise in both residential and industrial settings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the lack of mandatory requirements that instruments and procedures for measuring noise be included in a Noise Control Manual, the lack of certainty as to under which Ordinance identification cards for authorised persons were issued, and the lack of tabling in Parliament of Annual Reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister agreed to mandatory inclusion of the instruments and procedures for measuring noise in the Manual and tabling of the Annual Report, and undertook to amend the Ordinance accordingly. The Minister explained the connection between the Air Pollution Ordinance 1984 and this Ordinance regarding the issue of identification cards to authorised persons. The Committee accepted the Minister's advice and undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his co-operation in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>RATES AND LAND TAX (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 1988 BEING AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY ORDINANCE No. 63 OF 1988 AND MADE UNDER THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1910</PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance provides for triennial revaluations for rating and land tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern related to possible retrospectivity in the imposition of either rates or land tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P., explained the operation of the relevant sections. Rates may be retrospectively imposed where land was not valued or re-valued at the appropriate time, and while landowners may not know the value to be determined, the valuation would be in accord with the Ordinance with back-dated rates and land taxes being only for the period of ownership. There is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where the valuation is disputed. The Committee accepts the Minister's advice and thanks him for his cooperation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>NURSES ORDINANCE 1988 BEING AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY ORDINANCE No. 61 OF 1988 AND MADE UNDER THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1910</PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance establishes a Nurses Board to supervise the administration, registration and enrolment of nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the absence of the phrase ``without reasonable cause'' in particular provision, some omissions and apparent inconsistencies regarding review of decisions/applications for registration of categories of nurses/addresses for certificates and professional addresses in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts and Territories the Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P., agreed to amendment of the Ordinance to include the phrase ``without reasonable cause'', the address to which certificates are to be sent and other matters. The Committee accepted the Minister's explanations of the review provisions, the registration of existing infants nurses and non-inclusion of residential addresses in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his cooperation in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>AGENTS (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE (No. 2) 1988 BEING AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY ORDINANCE No. 47 OF 1988 AND MADE UNDER THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1910</PARA>
<PARA> This Ordinance introduces a scheme for the licensing of travel agents. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. joins a Co-operative Scheme for the Uniform Regulation of Travel Agents with a Participation Agreement (the Agreement) and a Travel Compensation Trust Fund Deed (the Deed) to provide for the protection of people who deal with licensed travel agents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the failure to provide copies of the Agreement and the Deed for perusal, whether the Agreement and the Deed form part of legislation, entry at any time by warrant, and tabling and disallowance of licence application forms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P., provided copies of the Agreement and the Deed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted the Minister's advice not to include the Agreement and the Deed in the legislation, and noted the provision in the Agreement for a Ministerial Council to oversee the compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted the Minister's advice concerning the necessity for the warrant to authorise entry at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that the licence application forms were not subject to tabling and disallowance. The Chairman informed the Minister that, in the Committee's view, and in line with precedents, forms were legislative in nature and should be prescribed by regulation; and sought re-consideration of the matter. The Minister undertook to remove certain paragraphs from the Ordinance in effect providing that applications need only to be in writing and signed by the applicant thereby obviating the need to prescribe licence application forms. The Committee accepts the Minister's undertaking and thanks him for his cooperation in these matters. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my letter of 23 November concerning the Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance, and I thank you for agreeing to defer the Senate's consideration of your motion of disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> At item (k) of my letter I indicated it would not be appropriate to make decisions under sections 54, 59, 61 (4), 62 (4), 64 (4) or 65 (5) reviewable. For the record I am advised that the actual decision making powers to which the above sections relate are contained in sections 53, 59, 61 (1), 62 (1), 64 (1), and 65 (1). </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated that the Attorney-General's Department had raised some difficulties with the undertakings I had made previously to amend similar sections of the ACT Ordinance. If implemented those undertakings would result in the Minister being obliged to grant approvals unless he or she was satisfied that the applicant did not meet the required criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department has pointed out, correctly, I believe, that this would alter the suitability test from one of ``demonstrated to be suitable'' to ``not demonstrated to be unsuitable''. This would be a far lower, and clearly unsatisfactory test. </PARA>
<PARA> Applicants under the sections in question seek approvals to undertake significant functions with regard to the casino and should bear the onus of establishing their suitability. This is so because it is essential that the highest possible standards of integrity be maintained to avoid possible corruption or infiltration of the casino by organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do agree that the Minister should not have a further discretion to refuse an approval once the relevant suitability criteria are satisfied, and accordingly, I propose to amend the Ordinance with regard to sections 53, 59, 61 (1), 62 (2), 64 (1) and 65 (1) to require the Minister to grant the approval if he or she is satisfied the relevant requirements are met. This would give effect to my previously expressed intention with regard to the ACT Ordinance, and make it easier for a refused applicant to apply for judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that this proposal and those contained in my previous letter will resolve the concerns raised by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 7 November 1988 concerning the Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance 1988 (`C Ordinance'). </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the points you raise were raised in the context of similar provisions in the ACT Casino Control Ordinance 1988. For most of these my response, below, is similar to my letter of 3 November on the ACT Ordinance. In some cases the Christmas Island situation requires different treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my letter of 3 November, however, the Attorney-General's Department has raised with my Department difficulties in implementing some of the undertakings I made in the ACT case. Some of the points raised are relevant to the CI Ordinance also. The difficulties are described below. As they require more detailed examination by officers of the two Departments, I cannot give a final response on them now, either in the Christmas Island or the ACT context. I should be grateful therefore if you agreed to the postponement of the Senate's consideration of your motion of disallowance of the CI Ordinance, which I believe is due this week, until later in the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>(a) `Agreement'</PARA>
<PARA> The `original Agreement' as defined in subsection 2 (1) of the CI Ordinance is an existing commercial agreement providing for the development of the Christmas Island resort and casino. It was therefore inappropriate to provide the same mechanisms as are provided in the ACT Ordinance relating to the ACT `Development Agreement'. The `original Agreement' was tabled in Parliament on 7 October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The `Agreement' as defined in subsection 2 (1) of the CI Ordinance refers to the `Original Agreement' as it might be after some future variation, and section 52 (as you have noted) provides that any variations would be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> As set out in paragraph (d) of my response relating to the ACT Ordinance, the Government was concerned to ensure disclosure of as many aspects of these commercial transactions as possible and has therefore provided for tabling of variations of the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> However the reality is that the Government would be unable to conclude commercial transactions if they were subject to disallowance and for this reason the Government believes it is essential that these documents not be disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) `the Court'</PARA>
<PARA> The appropriate jurisdiction for review of decision made under the CI Ordinance was the subject of careful consideration by both my Department and the Attorney-General's Department. It was concluded that given the geographic isolation of Christmas Island it would be expensive to confer jurisdiction on the AAT, which has no registry on the Island. It was agreed that the already existing Christmas Island Magistrate's Court could adequately exercise the review function. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to section 27, while subsection 27 (1) confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, subsections 27 (2) and 27 (3) give the option of having the matter dealt with summarily in the Magistrate's Court if both prosecution and defence agree. If the parties choose the summary jurisdiction, the penalty applicable is lessened. See the definition of `the Court' in subsection 2 (1). I agree that use of `the Court' here is somewhat confusing and I will have subsections 27 (2) and (3) amended to clarify it. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) and (d) Qualifications of Casino Controller and Deputy, and Casino Surveillance Authority; Inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I will amend the Ordinance to set a minimum qualification for the Casino Controller, Deputy, and Inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to qualifications for members of the Casino Surveillance Authority, the Committee will be aware of the geographic isolation of Christmas Island and the small size of the island community. These factors severely limit the choice of persons suitable and available for appointment to the Authority. The Government concluded it would be unrealistic to specify strict qualifications for Authority members in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree to amend the Ordinance to make the filling of a vacancy on the Authority mandatory, on the same conditions as will apply in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree to amend paragraph 8 (2) (b) as requested, and to insert into section 9 a provision similar to subsection 104 (3) of the ACT Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have considered your comments concerning subsection 9 (7) and I agree that personal searches are a very serious matter. With regard to the appointment of inspectors of both sexes, in a community as small as Christmas Island there can be difficulty in appointing `sufficient inspectors of both sexes'. However subsection 9 (7) will be amended so that only persons with appropriate appointments will conduct searches. I had not envisaged that bystanders would be called on. </PARA>
<PARA>(e) Police entry</PARA>
<PARA> I will amend subsection 10 (1) to accord with subsection 106 (1) of the ACT Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>(f) Disclosure of interests and delegations of powers</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not specified whether Authority members are to be `absentee' or `local', so that `absentee' members can be appointed whenever the smallness of the Christmas Island community makes this necessary. Nominees for appointment will be considered case by case and I expect that persons, `absentee' or `local', likely to have significant conflicts of interest would not be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to section 44 delegations, it is usual for such a power to exist to ensure the functions can be efficiently performed. Whether the Authority members are `absentee' or `local', I would not expect this power of delegation to be exercised in such a way as to dilute the power of the Authority itself. </PARA>
<PARA>(g) Forgery and Forged Documents</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is quite correct; subparagraph 46 (3) (b) (i) should read `remuneration or greater remuneration.'</PARA>
<PARA>(h) Lease of Project etc. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 63 (2) provides that in considering an application mentioned in subsection 63 (1) the Minister shall have regard to the matters specified in section 55. Subsection 55 (2) requires that the Minister should have regard to any recommendation made by the Authority. I believe this answers the Committee's concern. </PARA>
<PARA>(i) Cheques</PARA>
<PARA> I agree to amend the CI Ordinance along the lines agreed to in the ACT case. </PARA>
<PARA>(j) Restoration of Casino Employee's Service</PARA>
<PARA> I agree to insert a notification provision in subsection 105 (3). </PARA>
<PARA>(k) Appeals against Decisions</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it is appropriate to make decisions under sections 54, 59, 61 (4), 62 (4), 64 (4) or 65 (5) reviewable, as these decisions are essentially of a commercial and policy nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph (k) of my letter on the ACT Ordinance, I indicated that similar sections of the ACT Ordinance could be amended so that the Minister is required to grant the approval, etc. required unless the Minister is satisfied that the criteria specified for the approval are not met. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has been pointed out that a decision under section 59, for example, of the CI Ordinance, to approve the assignment of the casino licence, must be made with regard to the criteria specified in subsection 55 (1). That subsection requires (in this case) that the Minister be `satisfied' of such things as the business reputation, sound character and business conduct, and freedom from unfavourable business associations of the proposed assignee. To provide that approval is to be given unless the Minister is satisfied that the criteria are not met, means that, in a case where the Minister was unable to conclude that he or she was satisfied that the applicant for approval did not meet the criterion of e.g. a reputation for (past) sound business conduct, but had been presented with evidence that equally ruled out a satisfaction that the assignee did meet the criterion, the Minister would be obliged to grant the approval. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think this would be satisfactory. To prevent infiltration of the casino project by criminal interests, it is essential to insist that an applicant for approval to participate should bear the onus of establishing suitability. `Not unsuitable' is not a high enough standard to meet. As presently advised, therefore, I do not propose to extend my undertaking on the ACT Ordinance to these Christmas Island decisions. However, I have asked my officers to examine whether there is another way to accommodate your concerns, and I will be writing to you again on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment along ACT lines is not appropriate for section 66 of the CI Ordinance, for different reasons. The power to terminate a contract under the section already depends on the Minister's considering that it is not in the public interest for the contract to remain in force, there having been either no response to the Minister's `show cause' notice, or a response which does not persuade the Minister to change his opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> No `decision' is made under paragraph 102 (2) (c). The paragraph simply refers to the Controller's decision to renew or refuse to renew a licence. This is made under subsection 99 (1), which extends to both the initial licence and renewals of the licence. Decisions under subsection 99 (1) are reviewable-see paragraph 112 (1) (n). </PARA>
<PARA>(l) Forms</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to give the same undertakings in relation to forms as I gave in relation to the ACT Ordinance. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my letter to you of 7 November 1988 on the concerns of the Committee on some aspects of the Casino Control Ordinance of Christmas Island, No. 4 of 1988. One paragraph of the letter was inadvertently omitted. </PARA>
<PARA> The paragraph read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> ``(j) Restoration of Casino Employee's Service</PARA>
<PARA> Under s. 105 (3) the Authority `may, at any time, terminate, or reduce the period of, the suspension of a key employee's licence or an operation's employee's licence.' The Committee notes there is no requirement for notification of the employee and considers there should be such a provision.''</PARA>

<PARA>The Hon. Clyde Holding, M.P.,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for the Arts and Territories</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meetings on 20 October 1988 and 3 November 1988 the Committee considered the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 contained in the Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No. 4 of 1988. The Committee draws to your attention the following matters. </PARA>
<PARA>(a) ``Agreement''</PARA>
<PARA> The Ordinance merely contains definitions in s. 2 (1) of `'Agreement'' and ``the original Agreement'' and there are references in several sections to the ``agreement''. The A.C.T. Casino Control Ordinance, by contrast, sets out very fully provisions about the development and control agreements. In addition, there does not appear to be a provision for tabling the ``the original Agreement'' in Parliament, although s. 52 provides that a variation of ``the original Agreement'' is to be tabled. A further point is that although the variation is to be tabled Parliament does not seem to have power to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) The Court</PARA>
<PARA> Section 3 (1) defines ``the Court'' as the Magistrate's Court upon which are conferred rights that would normally be conferred on the mainland on the AAT. The Committee would be grateful for you advice on the reasons why this authority was conferred on the Magistrate's Court. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible there may be a confusing provision in s. 27 (2) and (3) which also refer to ``the Court''. Section 27 (1) confers jurisdiction for an offence on the Supreme Court and, given that the heading to s. 27 refers to the Supreme Court, almost certainly Supreme Court is meant. The Committee considers it may be desirable to clarify this drafting point. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) Qualifications of Casino Controller and Deputy, and Casino Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 4 provides that the Minister may appoint a Casino Controller and a Deputy or Deputies. Similarly, s. 33 provides for the appointment of the Casino Surveillance Authority. Upon these persons devolves almost all the legal authority for ensuring that the casino is properly run. The Committee notes that while there is no direct counterpart to the Casino Controller in the A.C.T. Ordinance there is, of course, a Casino Surveillance Authority. The Committee further notes that in contrast to the very strict provisions in the A.C.T. Ordinance relating to the qualifications of authority members there are no qualifications at all provided for in the Christmas Island Ordinance. The Committee would appreciate your comments on this. </PARA>
<PARA> You will recall the comments made by the Committee in its letter of 3 November 1988 regarding the filling of vacancies in the A.C.T. Casino Surveillance Authority. You will also recall your undertaking to amend the A.C.T. Ordinance to make the appointment of another person mandatory, provided that the Minister may decide not to make that appointment if satisfied that it would be inappropriate to do so, having regard to the small length of the remainder of the appointment period. The Committee considers there should be a similar provision in the Christmas Island Ordinance, particularly as the Authority will only have 3 members instead of the 5 in the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA>(d) Inspectors</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the qualifications of Casino Controller noted above in (c) is compounded by s. 5 providing that the Casino Controller (and not the Minister as in s. 11 (1) of the A.C.T. Ordinance) appoint inspectors without any qualifying criteria to curb the discretion. The inspectors, in turn, have great responsibilities for ensuring the proper running of the Casino, including very substantial powers of search of premises and persons. </PARA>
<PARA> You will recall the comments made by the Committee in its letter of 3 November 1988 regarding the power of an inspector to give a direction orally. In response to these comments you undertook to amend the A.C.T. Ordinance to provide that an oral direction is only to be given where the inspector is satisfied that the circumstances amount to an emergency. The Committee believes there should be a similar amendment of s. 8 (2) (b). </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee is concerned that, although under s. 9 an inspector may only search with consent, the protection which is written into s. 104 (3) of the A.C.T. Ordinance that ``it shall be presumed that the person did not consent unless the contrary is established'' is missing from the Christmas Island Ordinance. The Committee believes this should be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 9 (7) requires searches by a person of the same sex, but if not available another person of the opposite sex can be asked. The Committee believes personal searches are very serious matters and asks whether it is envisaged that bystanders will be called in. The Committee would appreciate reasons why there are not sufficient properly appointed inspectors of both sexes. </PARA>
<PARA>(e) Police entry</PARA>
<PARA> Section 10 provides that a police officer may enter whereas s. 106 of the A.C.T. Ordinance restricts this to a sergeant or officer authorised by an officer of sergeant's rank or above. The Committee accepts that personnel may be scarce on Christmas Island but believes that the alternative of proper authorisation by a more senior officer could be used. </PARA>
<PARA>(f) Disclosure of interests and delegation of powers</PARA>
<PARA> Section 37 requires disclosure of interests, quite properly so in the opinion of the Committee. The Committee would, however, welcome your advice as to the operation in practice of this provision. In particular, the Committee would like to know whether the Authority members are to be ``absentee'' or ``local'' and, if local, whether such a small population would result in many ``direct or (especially) indirect pecuniary interest'' problems. The same difficulties arise with s. 44 delegations; if Authority members are ``absentees'' then this wide delegation power greatly dilutes the authority of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>(g) Forgery and Forged Documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee asks whether the phrase ``to earn remuneration of greater remuneration'' is s. 46 (3) (b) (i) should be ``to earn remuneration or greater remuneration''. </PARA>
<PARA>(h) Lease of Project, or Casino and Casino Operation Agreement</PARA>
<PARA> Part VI deals with a lease of the project or Casino and the casino operation agreement or variations thereof and the suitability of persons. Under s. 63 (1) the Minister must have an investigation under s. 24 and the Committee asks whether the Authority should have a role in advising the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>(i) Cheques</PARA>
<PARA> Section 83 (2) provides for the Minister to specify the period for presentation of cheques by notice in the Gazette. You will recall the Committee's concern with the similar provision in s. 80 (2) of the A.C.T. Ordinance and your undertaking to amend the Ordinance to provide for Parliamentary Control. The Committee considers that similar changes should be made to s. 83 (2). </PARA>
<PARA>(k) Appeals against decisions</PARA>
<PARA> Many decisions under the Ordinance may be appealed against but others may not. The non-appealable decisions are: s. 54 (refusal to grant a licence); s. 59 (assignment of the casino licence); s. 61 (4) (refusal to approve lease); s. 62 (4) (refusal to approve casino operation agreement); s. 64 (4) (refusal to approve variation); s. 65 (5) (refusal to approve prescribed contract or variation); s. 66 (termination of prescribed contract); and s. 102 (2) (c) (refusal of renewal of casino employee's licence). The Committee would welcome your advice on why these matters were not made subject to appeal. You will recall the Committee raised similar concerns with respect to appeal rights in the A.C.T. Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>(l) Forms</PARA>
<PARA> There are references in the Ordinance to forms which are to be approved but no mention is made of Parliamentary review. These are: s. 16 (1) (directions for exclusion from casino); s. 53 (2) (form of casino licence); s. 59 (2) (form for assignment of casino licence); s. 61 (2) (application for approval of project or casino); s. 62 (2) (application for approval of casino operation agreement); s. 65 (2) (application for approval of prescribed contract); s. 89 (1) (form of financial statement and accounts); s. 95 (1) (application for casino employee's licence); s. 99 (3) (form of casino employee's licence); s. 101 (1) (form of provisional employee's licence); s. 102 (2) (application for renewal of casino employee's licence); s. 103 (2) (application for renewal of casino employee's licence); and s. 107 (1) (b) (information on all casino employees). You will recall the Committee raised similar concerns in relation to the A.C.T. Ordinance and that you undertook to make all the forms subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would welcome your advice and assistance in relation to the above matters. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 20 October 1988 concerning the Noise Control Ordinance 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that, according to the Explanatory Statement, the Noise Control Manual is to contain information on the instruments and procedures used when measuring noise. However the Committee is concerned that subsection 17 (2) gives the Authority a discretion as to whether such matters are included in the Manual. I accept the Committee's view that it should be mandatory for instruments and procedures to be set out in the Manual and undertake to amend the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> I also accept the Committee's view that Annual Reports should be required to be tabled in Parliament and undertake to amend section 49 of the Ordinance accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Committee's query concerning the production of identification cards by the Authority or inspectors, I hope that the following information explains the operation of subsection 26 (2) of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pollution Control Authority is a person appointed by the Minister under subsection 7 (1) of the Air Pollution Ordinance 1984. That person also has supervisory powers in relation to inspectors appointed under the Noise Control Ordinance. It is the Authority who appoints the inspectors and only the Authority can give directions to employers under the important Part III (Hearing Conservation) of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 7 (4) of the Air Pollution Ordinance 1984 only deals with the identification card issued to the Authority and reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Minister shall issue to a person appointed under subsection (1) a certificate signed by the Minister to the effect that the person is the Pollution Control Authority''. </PARA>
<PARA> No inspectors are issued identification cards under subsection 7 (4) of the Air Pollution Ordinance. While the Minister issues the identification card to the Authority under that Ordinance, the Authority issues the identification cards for inspectors under subsection 8 (1) of the Noise Control Ordinance. It would not be appropriate for the Noise Control Ordinance to provide for the Authority to issue itself with an identification card. Given that the Air Pollution Ordinance creates the Authority, it is more appropriate for that Ordinance to provide for the issuing of an identification card to the Authority. This is the substance of the reference to the Air Pollution Ordinance in subsection 26 (2) of the Noise Control Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that this letter is of assistance to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for the Arts and Territories,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 20 October 1988, the Committee considered the Noise Control Ordinance 1988 being A.C.T. Ordinance No. 71 of 1988, and tabled in the Senate on 27 September 1988. The Committee draws to your attention the following matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 17 refers to the preparation of a Noise Control Manual the purpose of which is spelt out in the Explanatory Statement as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Manual essentially consists of the procedures and instruments and noise measurements as contained in the Australian Standards. Because noise measurement is technical, the scientific aspects of the scheme are more appropriate in a Manual.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the approach adopted is the correct one where the relevant technology is likely to change. However, the Committee is concerned that subsection 17 (2) indicates that the Authority has a discretion as to whether such matters as mentioned in the Explanatory Statement are included in the Noise Control Manual. The Committee is of the opinion that it should be mandatory for instruments and procedures to be set out in the Manual and then amended from time to time under subsection 17 (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 26 (2) refers to the need for the Authority or an inspector to produce relevant identification to the occupier of a premises. The Committee believes that a certain amount of confusion may arise if the Authority or an inspector produces a certificate issued under subsection 7 (4) of the Air Pollution Ordinance 1984. An occupier may well query the relevance of an Air Pollution certificate when the issue concerns noise. The Committee believes that the subsection should be amended to prevent confusion and that in exercising powers under this Ordinance the Authority or an inspector produce an identification card pursuant to subsection 8 (1) of the Noise Control Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 49 refers to an Annual Report which is to be prepared on the operation of the Ordinance for the preceding twelve months. The Annual Report is to be given to the Minister. On a number of previous occasions the Committee has asked that Annual Reports of similar bodies be tabled in the Parliament and the Committee requests that consideration be given to having a provision inserted into the Ordinance requiring the Minister to table the Report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would welcome your assistance and advice in relation to these matters. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 30 September 1988 about the Rates and Land Tax (Amendment) Ordinance 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> You have sought my advice as to whether new sections 15a and 22ea apply rates or land tax retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 15a relates to land which has, for some reason or other, not been previously valued or revalued at the last general revaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> The section provides for the imposition of rates, or revised rates, for the period for which the land was unvalued or not re-valued. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect is that the owner of land can have rates retrospectively imposed on him or her. However, because this can only occur where the land is rateable and was not valued or re-valued at the appropriate time the land owner would always be aware that a valuation or revaluation would inevitably be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, there is no retrospective change to a landowner's legal obligation to pay rates. Whilst the owner would not know the value that would eventually be determined he or she would know that a valuation would be determined in accordance with the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Care has been taken to ensure that a person is only charged such back-dated rates and land tax for the period during which he or she actually owned the land in question. There is also a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in cases where the valuation is disputed. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar considerations apply to new section 22ea. It would only apply to land which had not been valued, or re-valued as required. Accordingly an owner should be aware that a revised assessment of land tax will be prepared. The appeal against a disputed unimproved value has the effect of allowing a review of the assessment of land tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the above information is of assistance. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 29 September 1988, the Committee considered the Rates and Land Tax (Amendment) Ordinance 1988 being ACT Ordinance No. 63 of 1988 and tabled in the Senate on 27 September 1988. The Committee draws to your attention the following matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Amending Ordinance inserts new subsections 11 (1) and (2) and new sections 15a and 22ea into the Principal Ordinance. The effect of these amendments appears to provide for triennial revaluations for rating and land tax purposes. The Committee's concern relates to the proposed method of operation of these sections as there appears to be a potential for retrospectivity in the imposition of either rates or land tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee seeks your advice in relation to the operation of these new sections. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1988 concerning the Nurses Ordinance 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Your reference to the no longer existing ``Authority'' is noted. It will be addressed by an amendment to be made as part of a general revision of the Ordinance as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for section 12 only providing for registration of existing infants' nurses and not for later qualifiers is because the category of infants' nurse has been defunct for some years, and is not an available registration category for any nurses applying for registration after the Ordinance comes into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's observation in relation to subsection 18 (5) is a valid one and it is proposed to insert the words ``without reasonable excuse'' in that subsection, when the Ordinance is revised. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisional registration was not made subject to review because it only allows interim registration pending outcome of the application for registration. Provisional registration enables persons to practise whilst the substantive application is being considered. Because of this the maximum period of such registration is three months, which would be an inadequate period within which to complete a review. </PARA>
<PARA> Express provision was not made for notification of cancellation of registration or enrolment, suspension of registration or enrolment, or reprimand, because the Board is required under section 40 to hold an inquiry before taking any one or more of these actions and subsection 31 (1) of the Health Professions Boards ( Procedures) Ordinance 1981 requires the Board after an inquiry to make a decision, notify each party of the decision giving its findings on material questions of fact and giving reasons for the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's comments in relation to subsection 49 (8) are noted. It is proposed to amend subsection 49 (8) to add the provision for certificates to be sent to a person's residential address. It is also proposed to amend subsection 22 (1)(a) to provide for the entering in the Register of a person's professional address. It is not, however, proposed to amend subsection 22 (1)(a) to provide for the entering in the Register of a person's residential address, as it is felt that information of a private nature should not be accessible through a public Register. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for the Arts and Territories</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 29 September 1988, the Committee considered the Nurses Ordinance 1988 being ACT Ordinance No. 61 of 1988 and tabled in the Senate on 27 September 1988. The Committee draws to your attention the following matters. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 July 1988 the former ``Australian Capital Territory Health Authority'' became the ``Australian Capital Territory Community and Health Service''. Section 3 (1) of this Ordinance made on 31 August 1988 defines ``Authority'' to mean the no longer existing ``Australian Capital Territory Health Authority''. The Committee notes that section 56 of the Ordinance requires that fees have to be paid to a non-existent Authority and that in section 57 (4) certain entitlements have to be approved by the General Manager of that same Authority. The Committee seeks your advice in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 12 provides for applications for registration by infants' nurses. Sections 10 and 11 provided for applications for registration as a general nurse, midwifery nurse and mental health nurse and each provided for applications by people who later qualify. The Committee notes, however, that section 12 only provides for registration of existing infants' nurses. The Committee seeks clarification as to reasons for the differences in approach to these categories of nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 31 (4) provides in relation to a certificate of enrolment as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``A person shall not, without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a notice given under subsection (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: $100''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that in the equivalent provision relating to registered nurses, namely section 18 (5), the words ``without reasonable excuse'' do not appear. This phrase is an important protection of individual rights and the Committee believes that it should be inserted in section 18 (5) to ensure that registered nurses enjoy the same rights as enrolled nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> Under subsection 19 (2) and subsection 32 (2) the Chairperson may grant a person provisional registration. Under subsection 20 (2) the Chairperson may grant temporary registration to a registered nurse. This latter provision is subject to review under the provisions of subsections 54 (2) and 55 (2). However the former provisions do not attract review rights and the Committee is concerned that a person applying for provisional registration does not have the right to seek a review of the decision made by the Chairperson in exercising a discretionary power. The Committee seeks your advice in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that under sections 55 (1) (e) and (h) provision is made for a review to the A.A.T. of a decision to cancel a registration or enrolment or a reprimand issued under section 38. However, under the notification provisions in section 54 (1), there is no requirement on the Board to notify a person of a cancellation of a registration or enrolment or of a reprimand. The Committee considers that such notification should be included in this section to ensure that the rights of the person involved are adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 49 (8) provides that a certificate fixing a reviewed fee under section 49 (2) is to be sent to the person's ``professional address''. The Committee is unable to find a provision requiring a person to have a ``professional address''. Section 13 (1) (b) (ii) states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``. . . his or her professional address in the Territory or, if the applicant has no professional address in the Territory, his or her usual place of residence, whether within or outside the Territory;''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee suggest that section 49 (8) should provide the same alternatives as appears in subsections 18 (4), 25 (c) and 31 (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Section 25 (a) deals with a change of address and requires the registered nurse to notify the Chairperson in writing where ``a change occurs in an address of a registered nurse entered in the Register under section 22.'' The Committee notes that there is no requirement under section 22 for the address of a registered nurse to be entered on the Register. The Committee suggests that section 22 (1) (a) should be amended to include a reference to section 13 (1)(b)(ii). </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looks forward to your assistance in these matters. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 25 November 1988 concerning the Agent's (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 2) 1988 (the Ordinance). </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee remains concerned as to several matters relating to the provisions for licence application forms under paragraphs 48 (1) (a) and 49 (1) (a) of the Agents Ordinance 1968 (the Principal Ordinance) as amended by paragraphs 26 (a) and 27 (a) of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the Committee holds strong views on the prescribing of licence application forms for the reason that Parliamentary scrutiny affords a degree of protection to individuals. While I adhere to the views advanced in my letter of 8 November 1988 I am prepared to remove paragraphs 26 (a) and 27 (a) of the Ordinance. The effect of this will be to reinstate the provision that an application need only be in writing and signed by the applicant. There would no longer be any reference to a form made available by the Board. This would then obviate any necessity to prescribe licence application forms and would, I trust, protect the privacy of the applicant in a manner acceptable to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for the Arts and Territories</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 8 November 1988 concerning aspects of the Agents (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 2) 1988, being A.C.T. Ordinance No. 47 of 1988 tabled in the Senate on 31 August 1988. The letter was considered by the Committee at its meeting on 24 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is grateful for your helpful advice which meets its first two concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes, however, that the licence application forms in ss. 48 (1) (a) and 49 (1) (a) of the Principal Ordinance, as amended by ss. 26 (a) and 27 (a) should be prescribed under the regulations. The Committee notes your description of the forms as administrative, by which it is assumed you mean the forms are not legislative. Here, the Committee understands that under the amendments the use of the forms may be mandatory, and unless the forms are used the Board may not, and possibly legally cannot, consider or deal with an application. In these circumstances the Committee considers that the forms will be documents of considerable significance for the individual concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also has difficulty with the forms being ``made available by the Board''. The Board in this case is the Agents Board of the Australian Capital Territory, a body characterised in your letter as independent. By this it is assumed you mean independent of Ministerial control. The Committee considers it undesirable that an independent body is to supply mandatory forms in connection with a compulsory scheme involving certain areas of personal and corporate livelihood. This is particularly so when the scheme provides what the Explanatory Statement calls ``strict penalties''. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important aspect is that of privacy. In the present case a Board with the characteristics described above require an individual or corporation, as a condition of practising a livelihood or carrying on a business, to furnish information by form. The Parliament is, apparently, neither to be made aware of such information nor to have power to do anything about it. The Committee is concerned that the type of information to be requested from individuals may be such that the Board does not wish it to be subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes the statement in your letter that it is ensured the forms will not be intrusive because of the independence of the Board (from the Minister? from the Secretary of the Department? from the Parliament?) and because it is composed of one public servant, one lawyer, two real estate agents, two travel agents and a consumer representative. The Committee believes, however, that prescription of the forms by regulation is appropriate and that the structure and composition of the Board are arguments in favour of, not against, Parliamentary tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes there are ample recent precedents for forms to be prescribed in A.C.T. Regulations. The Credit Regulations, Regulations 1985 No. 5 for example, prescribe eleven forms covering sixteen pages, with additional provisions relating to the completion of the forms. These Regulations were amended twice in 1986 in respect of the forms (Regulations 1986 Nos. 17 and 19), once to include an additional form and once to substitute an existing form. The Co-operative Societies Regulations (Amendment), Regulations 1985 No. 8 amended its Form C. The Liquor Regulations Form 9 was amended in 1986 (Regulations 1986 No. 20), as were Public Health (Dairy) Regulations, Regulations 1986 No. 28, Forms 1, 2, 3 and 4. Form 7 of the Liquor Regulations was amended in 1987 (Regulations 1987 No. 8) and Forms A and B of the Meat Regulations in 1988 (Regulations 1988 No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> All these new and amended forms were subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are parts of Schedules to A.C.T. Regulations which are in fact forms although not so called; see for example Schedule 1 to the Gaming Machine Regulations, Regulations 1987 No. 7, which refers to the mandatory use of ``the following form'' and the separate mandatory ``following form of declaration''. These are also subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> You will also recall your helpful offer to amend the Casino Control Ordinances of the A.C.T. (No. 72 of 1988) and Christmas Island (No. 4 of 1988) to provide for forms to be subject to tabling and disallowance by way of regulation, and the acceptance by the Committee so far of your offer for the A.C.T. Ordinance. Your statement is noted that your consent in the case of the A.C.T. Casino Control Ordinance is not to be taken as a general precedent that forms should be made as legislative instruments and that such a decision would depend on the circumstances of each case. The Committee believes, however, that in the present situation there is a stronger argument on personal rights and liberties and privacy grounds for the forms being prescribed than in most of the other many examples where this is done. Simply by way of example, I refer you to the Noise Control Regulations, Regulations 1988 No. 18, made on 1 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would appreciate your early advice on this important matter. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 1 September 1988 to the former Minister the Hon. Gary Punch MP, concerning the Agents (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 2) 1988 (the Ordinance) in which you seek advice in relation to three matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly the Committee points out that in its examination of the Ordinance it was not able to cite the documents involved. By this I take the Committee to be referring to the Participation Agreement and the Travel Compensation Fund Trust Deed. To assist the Committee I have attached a copy of the Trust Deed and the Participation Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought advice as to whether the Trust Deed or the Participation Agreement forms part of the legislation of participating states. None of the States have incorporated the Agreement in their legislation as it is preparatory to the enactment of the legislation and dictates the form that the legislation is to take. Further, its inclusion may involve unnecessary and confusing duplication of provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The States of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia have included the Deed in their Regulations. In Victoria the Minister has power to declare by notice in the Gazette a scheme to be an approved compensation scheme for the purposes of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> To prescribe the Deed under the regulations or to include it in a schedule to the Ordinance would unnecessarily complicate the amendment procedure for the Deed. The Deed will be an evolving document and I am of the opinion that the amendment procedures to effect a change should be as flexible as possible to ensure that where there is a requirement to amend the Deed members of the community and registered travel agents will not be disadvantaged because of inherent delays in processing an amendment to the legislation. It is worth noting that the Participation Agreement established a Ministerial Council to oversight the compensation scheme and this will include the Trust Deed. Given the involvement of the Ministerial Council, the ACT Administration and the Agent's Board I am confident there will be ample supervision of the Trust Deed to protect the public while maintaining sufficient administrative flexibility to ensure the efficient operation of the scheme. The Deed is held at the office of the Registrar of Agents and will be available to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly the Committee expresses concern that paragraph 71l (3) (c) provides that a warrant may authorise entry at any time of the day or night, where it does not specify particular hours. As some unlicensed agents operate on a part-time basis and outside normal office hours it is important for the Ordinance to authorise entry at times appropriate to those unusual operations. In addition, the Attorney-General's Department advises that the paragraph is consistent with similar provisions, such as paragraph 235 (3) (b) of the Credit Ordinance 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly the Committee seeks advice as to whether the licence application forms as provided for in paragraphs 26 (a) and 27 (a) are to be prescribed under the regulations. The forms are of an administrative nature and as such it is undesirable to prescribe them. It may be necessary from time to time to amend the application forms to reflect the requirements of the Agent's Board or those of the industry. I consider that the structure and independence of the Board will ensure that the forms used will not be intrusive and will only require essential information necessary for the Board's deliberations. Presently the Board consists of a representative from the ACT Administration, a Barrister and Solicitor, two real estate agents and a community consumer representative. Following the expansion of the Board by the Ordinance from five to seven members it is intended, on the participation in the scheme by the ACT, to appoint two travel agents to the Board. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting of 1 September 1988, the Committee considered Agents (Amendment) Ordinance 1988 being A.C.T. Ordinance No. 47 of 1988 and tabled in the Senate on 31 August 1988. The Committee draws your attention to the following matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts as an excellent idea that the A.C.T. will join the national scheme for the protection of the interests of people who deal with licensed travel agents. The Committee's concern relates to the fact that, in its scrutiny of the Ordinance, which contained many references to the travel compensation scheme and the trust deed, it was unable to actually cite the documents involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that such documents should form part of the Ordinance but recognises that this may be impossible. However, the Committee feels that to fulfil its function the documents should be made available to Committee members and requests the Minister to make such documents available. The Committee also seeks information as to whether the documents form part of the legislation of any of the other participating States or Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 71l (3) (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``a warrant shall . . . specify particular hours during which the entry is authorised, or state that the entry is authorised at any time of the day or night.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned about the wording of this section especially the words ``day or night'' and seeks your advice as to the necessity of including such a phrase which is a very wide alternative power. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 48 and 49 of the Principal Ordinance are amended by sections 26 (a) and 27 (a) which state in part:</PARA>
<PARA> ``accordance with a form made available by the Board for the purpose''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee seeks your advice as to whether the forms mentioned in these sections will be open to Parliamentary scrutiny by being prescribed forms under the regulations?</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looks forward to your advice and assistance in relation to these matters. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Harradine moving that the General Business Notice of Motion No. 232 standing in the name of Senator Peter Baume, relating to World Aids Day, be called on forthwith and have precedence over all other business until determined. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday a notice of motion was placed before the Senate by Senator Peter Baume. Today is World AIDS Day. It is important that the Senate debate this motion. We should ensure that time is made available today for complete consideration and debate of this question. It would be treating this matter with ill-considered haste if the motion were to be called formal. To pass this motion as a mere formality in this chamber, without giving the chamber the opportunity to consider and debate the matter fully, would be doing it an injustice. There is a need to get this question right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important matter. It needs to be discussed and debated today. That is why I am moving my motion. It is necessary that this be done, not only because of the importance of the matter but also so that we, as members of this chamber, members of parliament, get this situation right. It would not be appropriate for the Senate to pass Senator Baume's motion unless the opportunity had been given to Senator Baume and other honourable senators to consider what policies will minimise the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other parts of the motion express sympathy to the families and friends of the more than 500 Australians who have died already from AIDS. It is important for this motion to be fully debated so that we can place on record the fact that there is a fundamental premise, which is that we should treat persons with the AIDS virus with unconditional care and consideration. We should not be judgmental, in the sense that no-one can judge the interior disposition of another. It is important that we have this opportunity of debating this issue so that we are able to identify the high risk activity and to ensure that future generations do not act in a way that would only spread this disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important for this debate to take place. I do not consider that policies which treat homosexuality as another valid lifestyle, particularly if this is being taught in schools, are appropriate. Some people believe that and may say, if the motion is passed, `Well, the Senate has supported policies which minimise the impact of HIV infection'. I do not consider that to be the case at all. I do not consider that a policy which virtually says, `You can do what you like, when you like, how you like, with whom you like, provided you use a condom', is going to minimise the impact of HIV infection. I do not believe that the promotion of abortion of babies of HIV-infected women is a proper way to minimise the impact of HIV infection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I am attempting to indicate the importance that honourable senators should attach to this motion and the need to know precisely what the motion means. I am saying this quite seriously today, because, unless we know precisely what this motion means, it may be used as justification by the Government, or anybody else, to promote policies which would, in the long term, create a climate for the dramatic spread of AIDS in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to discuss this motion, it ought to be discussed now and it ought to be given priority on this day. That is a major consideration, because 1,100 persons in Australia have been diagnosed as having AIDS, and nearly half of those people have died. So it is an important matter. It should not simply pass without comment. Time needs to be allowed, at this first stage of our proceedings today, for a full discussion to take place on this question. The final reason why I believe it ought to be discussed today is that this will be the only occasion that the Senate will have to discuss this question prior to the date on which responses to the Government's discussion paper close. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This proposal by Senator Harradine is entirely a straw man. He has put it up to knock it over. I presented the notice of motion yesterday, and it would have been my wish that it could have been called on as formal today in the Senate. But I have no desire to override the procedures or rights of other senators. I did not seek to have the motion declared formal because Senator Harradine had told me himself that he would not agree to such a procedure. I have no wish to override the entitlements of any senator. Senator Harradine is entitled to speak to this motion when it is called on, so I did not seek to have it declared formal, knowing that Senator Harradine wished to speak to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no wish to prevent discussion and I took no action to prevent discussion. It is Senator Harradine who has sought to suspend Standing Orders to have the matter brought on now. I wish that the Senate could have agreed to this motion as a formal matter this morning. The motion is, after all, quite unexceptionable. This is World AIDS Day. The motion merely notes the fact. It expresses our concern; it draws attention to the fact that many people have died; it applauds the efforts of many Australians who have taken part in the fight against the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); it acknowledges the Quilt project as one of the activities being undertaken to commemorate World AIDS Day; it draws attention to the fact that it is part of an initiative of the World Health Organisation, particularly part of the global program on AIDS; it seeks multipartisan support for programs and it encourages the widest community consideration of, and support for, policies which will minimise the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion says nothing about some of the matters to which the honourable senator referred in his address which, of course, we know went beyond the proper bounds of a speech to suspend Standing Orders. I congratulate Senator Harradine on his ability to weave through the Standing Orders. But I am part of a Senate which has a very busy program. I remind you, Mr President, that today is 1 December and we still do not have the Government's Appropriation Bills agreed to. We have an enormous program of work. Whatever the faults of the Government in its programming, the fact is that here we are, on 1 December, programmed to get up on, I think, 16 December, with an enormous backlog of important legislation to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have wished this motion could have been agreed to by honourable senators without debate, because this is 1 December, because it is World AIDS Day and because it is essentially unexceptionable. But that is not possible. Senator Harradine indicated to me that I would not get his approval to have it declared formal, and I did not seek to have it declared formal. It was Senator Harradine who then took the initiative and decided he would seek to suspend Standing Orders now. I would like nothing better than to have Senate support this proposal. It is a proper proposal to be agreed to today. It is a proper proposal in its content, and it merely places the Senate alongside the work of many people around the world in trying to reduce and minimise the adverse impact of HIV infection and AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Harradine that the motion is not being agreed to because of what he said, that it is not possible for it to go formal today. I do not think that creates of itself the necessity for the work of the Senate to be put aside. I would like this motion to be agreed to but I am not prepared to suggest that the Senate puts aside its other work in order to expedite this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating whether the Senate should change its program today to debate, instead of the appropriations, Senator Peter Baume's notice of motion. We feel that this ought to be a formal motion. It is an appropriate one for this time. Indeed, it expresses a number of views that should be expressed at this time. To suspend Standing Orders, however, particularly in view of the problem that we have with appropriations, is really not possible. I would dearly like it to be possible but I think all honourable senators realise it is not possible to do that today. That is unfortunate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The notice of motion expresses a number of items affecting those people who are fighting in the area of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). I say, along with quite a number of others in this chamber, that this is not an academic exercise. It affects us personally. In fact, on the weekend I was in a hospital room with a very close family friend who is dying of AIDS. It has a spiralling effect out into the community. To see somebody, who is in the prime of life, incredibly intelligent, highly educated and holding an extraordinarily responsible job in the community, dying of AIDS and to know that, for example, some doctors will not come into the room is an experience that ought to touch everybody very deeply. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that this notice of motion was compassionate and expressed a point of view that everybody ought to be able to support. It is a pity that the motion, we are now debating will not be supported so that we may express, on this World AIDS Day, our sympathy to AIDS sufferers and their families and to the people working in this area. The notice of motion contains nothing which one could take exception to. However, I indicate that we will not be able to support suspension of standing orders. I wish we could. </PARA>

Since this matter has been raised in the Senate this morning, I would not wish the remarks which have been made by Senator Peter Baume necessarily to be taken to express the total view of everyone on the Opposition side of the chamber in relation to his notice of motion. I would not myself have raised the matters that have been raised by Senator Harradine because it was my understanding that this notice of motion would not be declared formal and, therefore, the matter would not arise. But since Senator Harradine has raised it by his motion to suspend Standing Orders, may I simply say that, notwithstanding the obviously very close and careful consideration which has been given by the drafters of the motion to producing a motion which purports to be in totally unexceptionable language, had the matter come before the Senate at least paragraph (f) of the motion would have raised considerable doubts in my mind because of its ambiguity-I have to say deliberate ambiguity-as to what the policies in question are or might be which are referred to in that paragraph. I simply say that I am not going to support Senator Harradine's motion to suspend Standing Orders, but I would not wish by my silence to have my position on the motion itself misunderstood.</PARA></TALK.START>

Had it come on I would have wholeheartedly voted for it and I believe that probably 80 per cent of this chamber would have given it support. The other issue is Government business. We had a debate on the Green Paper on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) some time ago in this chamber. We are now facing a situation in which the Appropriation Bills need to be passed. It is not as though on this occasion in this session the Government did not have legislation for this chamber to consider. We have had legislation from day one. There have been no delays as there have been in the past. We have had an immense amount of legislation to consider. In the first two weeks of the session we had seven matters of public importance on the Constitution. For the first seven weeks of sitting less than 30 per cent of this chamber's time has been devoted to legislation. We have had numerous disallowance motions and other things. I have not taken a grumpy attitude to this. I have just said to myself, `Well, the Senate rolls along as it always rolls along'.

Senator Harradine has been here since 1975 and he knows that once a debate such as this starts it could well go through until 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock tonight. We have seen that happen before. We have seen a three-minute report on the Parliament House Construction Authority blow out to two hours. One Wednesday we spent 47 minutes on notices of motion. This place becomes an anarchistic swamp in which time is totally wasted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our rejection of the motion to suspend Standing Orders today should not and cannot be taken as a lack of concern for AIDS victims. I was very tempted to move an amendment which supported the motion but added to it the words `at 10.30 p.m. this day', in order to test people's sincerity and see who wanted to stay here until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning debating these issues. We must get the Appropriation Bills through today. It is not a scare tactic to say that next week a lot of people will not be paid. Already one group of public servants-those who take cash-will have their pay delayed, so we need to get those Bills through today. We probably have three or four hours debate left on the Appropriation Bills. I assure those few people who read Hansard that the rejection by the Government of the motion to suspend Standing Orders is not a lack of concern for the motion supported by Senator Peter Baume. I say on behalf of all Government senators that that motion would have received our enthusiastic support.

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill's genesis is a request from the South Australian Government that the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be amended to enable the appointment of additional members to the National Crime Authority for specific investigations. The South Australian Government has indicated that such an amendment would allow the appointment of an additional member to undertake a proposed South Australian reference to the National Crime Authority in relation to allegations of criminal activity and corruption in South Australia. Further, the South Australian Government has formally agreed to fund the establishment of a National Crime Authority office in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority is a highly skilled body working in the most complex areas of organised crime. It is a relatively small body which has demonstrated an ability to investigate across the broad spectrum of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority was established, in part, as a viable alternative to the then growing proliferation of Royal Commission-type inquiries which were undertaking investigations into a variety of subjects, and in particular various aspects of organised criminal activity. The Authority's independence, coercive powers, knowledge and expertise in the fight against organised crime together with its focus on the gathering of admissible evidence make it the best alternative to deal with allegations of criminal activity and corruption of the kind being made in South Australia. The South Australian Government has already had the benefit of a Report from the National Crime Authority on certain South Australian investigations during 1986 and 1987 so that the Authority has a knowledge of the South Australian criminal environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-Governmental Committee has approved a South Australian reference pursuant to section 14 of the National Crime Authority Act. The Inter-Governmental Committee also considered this Bill and supports the Commonwealth introduction of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that this Bill amends the National Crime Authority Act to allow the Inter-Governmental Committee, which consists of the Commonwealth Minister and a Minister from each participating State, to create additional offices of member of the National Crime Authority in relation to a specific Commonwealth or State reference. These additional offices can only be created where a reference to the Authority has been made and the Inter-Governmental Committee, having regard to that reference and any related references, thinks that the appointment of an additional member of the Authority is necessary to enable the Authority to perform its functions. For example, where the Inter-Governmental Committee concludes that a reference requires that the member undertaking it have special skills or expertise or that the Chairman's and 2 members' resources are fully utilised, then it can create an additional office of member to conduct that reference. These amendments will provide the Inter-Governmental Committee with the power to increase the number of members of the Authority to enable the Authority to deal with additional matters warranting referral to the Authority without impeding the Authority's current activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the additional member will be appointed to undertake a particular reference and any related references nominated by the relevant Commonwealth or State Minister. For example, where an additional member is appointed to undertake a South Australian reference and the criminals involved in South Australia also operate or have connections in Victoria, the Victorian Minister may state that a resultant Victorian reference is related to the South Australian reference. The additional member would then undertake both the South Australian reference and the related Victorian reference. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be the function of the Inter-Governmental Committee to unanimously recommend a person for appointment to an additional office of member and any advice to the Governor-General with respect to the appointment is required to be consistent with the recommendation under proposed new subsection 7 (8AB). </PARA>
<PARA> An underlying premise of the Bill is that the facility to appoint additional members will be used for dealing with additional Commonwealth or State references and will allow the number of members of the Authority to fluctuate in response to the number, nature and status of the references made to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers and functions of the additional member are limited to the original reference or any related references. The Bill provides that an additional member ceases to hold office upon the withdrawal of the original reference in relation to that member or the completion of the original reference or any related references. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Senate appointed the Committee on 25 August 1988 to inquire into and report upon a number of matters relating to the referral of Bills to committees and changes to Senate procedures to facilitate the referral of Bills and the expediting of Senate consideration of Bills. The Committee considered its task to be one of recommending specific and practical proposals to achieve the aims of more thorough examination of legislation and more efficient processing of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee notes in the report that there has been a general view among senators for some years that the referral of more Bills to committees would improve the legislative process and allow more effective examination of legislation. The Committee has made a number of specific recommendations, including a recommendation that more Bills than at present be referred to committees. Each recommendation is accompanied by a specific alteration to the procedures of the Senate to give effect to the recommendation. The Committee recommends that these changes to procedures be adopted by the Senate. The proposals of the Committee include a number of measures to expedite proceedings in the Senate and thereby save time which may be devoted to consideration of Bills by committees. </PARA>
<PARA> At its first meeting the Committee authorised its members to confer freely with other senators concerning proposals before the Committee. The members of the Committee, particularly the three party Whips, then engaged in a consultative process to receive ideas from senators and to test the reaction of senators to various proposals. The aim of this process was to ensure that the Committee made sound and practical recommendations which were likely to attract considerable support from senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that its proposals do not involve a radical change in how the Senate operates but only a shift of the allocation of time spent on legislation from the Senate itself to committees. The proposals have been carefully framed so as to appropriately preserve the rights of individual senators and of the majority of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked to indicate that some members of the Committee reserve their final position in relation to some of the recommendations, and may not necessarily support specific recommendations when they are finally dealt with by the Senate. Those senators have supported the inclusion of these recommendations because they consider they are worthy of consideration by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank my fellow members of the Committee for their diligent work. On behalf of the Committee I also thank the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, and Mr Neil Bessell, of the Senate Committee Office, for their invaluable assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Colston)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid I might take a little time on this proposed expenditure. However, I take note of the very important point made before by the Minister for the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) about the need to pass the Appropriation Bills today. There are certain outstanding matters concerning the Department of Administrative Services and others still to be considered which cannot properly pass without comment in this important committee stage of the debate. The first issue I want to raise under the Department of Administrative Services relates to the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS). We had discussions on that matter in Senate Estimates Committee E.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague has just said, the accepted definition of NMLS is animals. From the Opposition's point of view I have to say that the animals are doing a good propaganda job on behalf of this Government. That is the point I want to take up because what we have seen in the operation of the National Media Liaison Service is nothing short of a deliberate misuse of public money for the purposes of a political party as distinct from the government of the day. That ought to be a matter of considerable concern to this Parliament and certainly to the taxpayers of Australia, because we are talking about an organisation with a budget exceeding $1m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many questions were asked about this matter in the Estimates Committee. I have received answers to some of the many questions Senator Michael Baume and I and others raised, but there are numerous questions to which I have not yet received replies in relation to NMLS. I am concerned that we will have to go through and pass the appropriations for this Department without appropriate replies having been received to all the questions that I have asked. I would like to know why this has occurred, whether it has been a deliberate action or an oversight. It is a matter of concern. I do not think we can get away with it by saying that Administrative Services wants to give all the answers in one hit. After all, we have got some of the answers already in relation to other aspects of administrative services so why do we not have answers relating to NMLS?</PARA>
<PARA> We heard in the Estimates Committee that this Labor Government is, in the Minister's eyes, blameless in its operation of NMLS or certainly no worse or different from predecessor governments, in particular the Fraser Government. We were told that the Fraser Government had a similar operation which operated under guidelines which were more politically colourful than the existing one. One might reasonably ask: What is the Opposition's concern? Why should Australian taxpayers be concerned about it?</PARA>
<PARA> There are several points that ought to be made that have not been appropriately and properly made about the operations of the NMLS and the way in which it has differed from the operations of previous liaison units under other governments, particularly the Fraser Government. There is no doubt that the NMLS under this Government has stepped up its political operations. This has been done at the deliberate direction of the Government. One has only to talk to the people in the press gallery in this building to know that the NMLS is a very powerful political propaganda unit. It is not a unit which is operating simply to disseminate the information of government. To pretend that it is acting in that way is to try to fool the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I think needs to be brought out is that the figures that have been provided, including during the Senate Estimate Committee hearings, on the costs and the numbers involved in this propaganda unit are questionable because the NMLS is in addition to individual press secretaries for Ministers. We are still awaiting answers to relevant questions as to the number of additional staff involved in those activities. Why have those questions not been answered? Surely it would be simple to find the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that the Committee ought to be aware of is that the salaries for the NMLS are not included under a specific NMLS vote; the salaries are hidden in other parts of the accounts. I asked the Government; it was raised in the Estimates Committee. I do not believe we got anything like a satisfactory reply. I ask the Minister again: Why is there not a specific allocation that can be more clearly identified? In particular, by putting the salary of the Director of the NMLS under a different vote and giving him another hat, the Government is deliberately circumventing its own guidelines in terms of the operations of the unit. The Director of the NMLS spent most of his time-this was admitted during Estimates hearings-during the last election campaign at the Australian Labor Party's (ALP) campaign headquarters. As I said, the Government has admitted that. Surely nobody expects us to believe that in that capacity he was promoting Government policy; of course he was not. His activities at the ALP campaign headquarters during the last election were overtly partisan. They had nothing to do with the promotion of Government programs; they had everything to do with getting the ALP elected-with taxpayers' funds paying the salaries of those people. The NMLS has a staff of 21 spread around Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been increased to 22. It has a total budget in excess of $1m. To supervise that operation should take a very large chunk of the Director's time. To say, as one of the officials at the Senate Estimates committee said, that the Director is primarily the director of the ministerial media group is a laugh. The NMLS has a turnover greater than most small businesses in Australia. If the Director is taking his job seriously of course he would have to be directing a large chunk of his time towards those activities. So I say to the Committee that the operation of the NMLS, and in particular the way in which the Director's salary is accounted for, is simply a device to circumvent the Government's own guidelines. Until we receive further answers to the questions that have been put, the full extent of the Government's usage of taxpayers' funds for overtly political purposes vis-a-vis the NMLS cannot be known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reject completely the statements that have been made by the Government that it really has just been continuing what the Fraser Government put in place. No previous government has used a media liaison group, by whatever title, in the way in which the Hawke Government has. There is no doubt that it represents a deliberate misuse of public money. In effect, what we are seeing with the NMLS is a deliberate diversion of taxpayers' money into the coffers of the Labor Party's propaganda machine. I hope that at the next Senate Estimates hearings, for the Supplementary Estimates, we will be able to have a much more objective and frank disclosure of the activities of that Service. </PARA>

If examples are brought up, we will examine them. I will not accept them on face value because I have learned not to accept things on face value from those opposite. Let me give the Committee an example of that. Senator Short said today that numerous questions have not been answered. I would like Senator Short to detail the questions that have not been answered. Six questions within my ministerial responsibility covering Immigration and Administrative Services are yet to be answered. Senator Short is awaiting three replies. The first is in respect of a question asked on page 114 of the Estimates Committee Hansard regarding the names, salaries and location of NMLS members since its creation. On page 117 Senator Short asked a question about salaries and administrative costs. Finally, on page 125, Senator Short asked a question on notice which does not relate to animals at all but concerns ministerial consultants. It is always possible that in our search of the Hansard we have overlooked what Senator Short regards as questions on notice.

So we are looking at a period of 13 years of comparative costs. This will probably involve getting records back from archives to be researched in order to give the honourable senator an answer. This will involve immense cost. Questions of this sort take some time to answer. But Senator Short cannot accuse me of allowing a lot of questions asked at Estimates Committees to be unanswered. I always get on the back of the department concerned. Where it is possible to provide answers, they are provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, we hear all of this nonsense from those opposite about there being a massive propaganda machine for the Australian Labor Party. The job of the NMLS is to collate, monitor and disseminate information in support of Government programs. As I said, the memo that I signed last year contained a specific direction not to get involved in partisan politics. Senator Short has not raised some of the other answers he received to his questions. For instance, he asked how many officers travelled to Melbourne in the August-September period. The inference is that they all go down on a free ticket to see the football grand final. How many of the animals staff went to New South Wales during the period of the New South Wales election? Senator Baume has not referred to that. The answer is none. Why does Senator Baume not refer to a lot of the answers where he was clean bowled?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honest! Let us have a look at the media guide published by the Liberal Secretariat. It advises people to go to the Government Information Unit for assistance. How does a coalition member get his information, and who does he use? He uses the Government Information Unit-as a candidate, not as a member of parliament. Of course he does. Let us look at the memo of 1978 which talks about the liaison officers the then Government was appointing. The problem was that those in the States were `unusually susceptible to anti-Canberra stories', so it wanted to appoint liaison officers in the Government Information Unit. Their role-the memo says `his' role, but we have gone a long way in 10 years-was `to report regularly on significant State issues which have or could have relevance to the Government, to disseminate effectively government information in his State'. On it goes talking about his role `to liaise and communicate with Ministers'. The final point was `to maintain close contact with party officials in the States keeping them fully informed of developments on the Federal scene'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is very little difference between the Government Information Unit and the National Media Liaison Service. There has been very little difference in the criticism of both-when we were in opposition and now that the coalition is in opposition. I bet Senator Short and Senator Michael Baume anything they like that, if they win the next election or the one after, they will also have a unit working in Parliament House disseminating government policies. Of course they will. It will be part of a Minister's staff. It will not be part of the Public Service, in exactly the same way as the NMLS is not part of the Public Service. All we are hearing is bleating from the Opposition-all to do with excuse-making: `Why can we not win elections? It is all to do with the Government's propaganda machine, it is all to do with the crook electoral system. It is all to do with this or that, et cetera'. They are whinges of opposition. I have been through it all. I know what it is about. The reality is that the Opposition should look elsewhere for its failings, and not try to blame some sort of conspiracy theory.

<PARA> There would seem to be a big difference between what exists now and what existed under the Fraser government, and what the organisation was when it was started by the Whitlam government as the Australian Government Liaison Service in the early 79s. That service had a far greater claim to impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA> It, at least, put up some pretence of putting out a straightforward, relatively impartial record of what the Government was doing. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There are those who have worked for the liaison service who say it did a scrupulous job of being impartial in 1983 under the former special minister for State, Mr Mick Young. </PARA>
<PARA> They say it was later, when it came under the direction of Mr Colin Parks -</PARA>
<PARA>with his famous two hats-</PARA>
<PARA>and the former minister for sport and tourism, Mr John Brown, that the service took on a sharper political focus. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Parks is then quoted in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The service did become a lot more active after I took over. </PARA>
<PARA>I am putting to the Minister that it is not simply an Opposition plot to describe this service as such. Journalists are quoted in this article as saying exactly the same thing, and its director is effectively conceding a change, certainly in style and emphasis, after he took it over to make it more active-and clearly more politically active. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the absolute nonsense this Minister was prepared to come out with today. I have a high regard for this Minister in normal circumstances. It is only in this situation-where he knows that he has an impossible case to defend, where he is defending the indefensible, defending a propaganda machine which he knows is acknowledged by journalists themselves to be a propaganda machine-that this Minister comes in and embarrasses himself by making the extraordinary remark that there is very little difference between the information services of the present Labor Government and the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already heard comments by journalists, but let us consider the detail of the facts. In the Estimates Committee hearings this Minister had the effrontery to say that even in numerical terms there was very little difference between the two services. He came out with some incredibly phoney statistics. As a result, I asked him specifically for an honest comparison between the public relations and press officer activities of the Fraser Government and of his Government. Ten minutes ago I received the answer. I received it fortuitously before this debate began because I just happened to go back to my office to pick up some papers. This debate could well have gone on without my knowing the answer existed. Senator Short, who stayed in the chamber, did not receive these replies and made his contribution without the knowledge that they existed. I hope that that may well prompt Senator Short to have another go. </PARA>
<PARA> The information revealed in response to my question, the real comparison of how many staffers the Fraser Government had engaged in public relations and press office activities and how many staffers this Government has-including `animals' and their media service-leads us to take a staggeringly different view from the one this Minister was prepared to put across to the Estimates Committee and to this Parliament. The reality is that the Fraser Government's liaison service was in place of providing press secretaries for most Ministers. Very few Ministers in the Fraser Government had press secretaries-for one very good reason: Fraser had seen how under the Whitlam Government, with every Minister having a press secretary, those press secretaries spent most of their time promoting their Ministers instead of promoting the Government. It was chaotic. All one had to do was go down to the non-members bar every night and one would find press secretaries of different Ministers not only promoting their Ministers but trying to undermine other Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraser said he would have none of that when he was in government. He limited the number of Ministers having press secretaries to a very small number indeed. The Prime Minister had three; the Deputy Prime Minister had one; the Leader of the Government in the Senate had one; and there were two to cover all other Ministers. That was a total of seven press secretaries for the entire Ministry. That, of course, was a very different situation from the one which exists under this Government. We find that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has two; the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) has one; the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has one; the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has one; and the other Ministers have 10-a total of 15.

What this table shows is that instead of their being similar in number, the total number of press secretaries in February 1983, under the previous Government, was 16. Under this Government, it is 30-just about double. In this Minister's view, that means, `It's just about the same'. That is what he said; that there is no difference. A doubling is `no difference' to this Minister. How can we take him seriously when he comes into this place? It is incredible that a man of his integrity-and I respect his integrity-should come in with such an appalling brief and pretend that a doubling of the number of people in a propaganda machine does not constitute any real difference. It is absolutely incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at this Government's other public relations people. The total under the Fraser Government, as I said, was 16: the Minister had seven; there were three in the Government Information Unit; and there were six Federal information directors. The total number was 16. Under this Government, instead of there being seven public relations people attached to Ministers, as I said, there are 15 attached to Ministers; there are nine `animals', and another six in the Ministerial Media Group are allocated to Ministers. In a sense, instead of 15 ministerial press secretaries, basically there are 21. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only part of the matter, because on top of that, there are 12 back-up `animals' staff-in this propaganda machine-lifting the number of press secretaries, or back-up staff, not to 30, but to 42. This is a propaganda machine of 42 people, costing multimillions of dollars. This Minister hides behind that fact, saying, `It's roughly the same number; it's roughly about the same as it was under the Fraser Government; there is no real difference'. On both scores, numerical and factual, about what it actually does, there is a monumental difference in style, nature and size, and this Minister cannot get away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an attempt, at the end of this response, to pretend that the situation is not quite as bad as it looks. The response reads:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to make a direct comparison between the number of press secretaries employed by Ministers of the Fraser Government as against the number of press secretaries employed by the present Government as a number of journalists and media staff were employed by Ministers of the Fraser Government in positions not described as press secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the most incredibly asinine remark that could be made. The question is: What were they actually doing? Is the Minister suggesting that people who were employed for other purposes were in fact wickedly and deceptively doing other jobs? I do not recall this alert and dynamic Minister, who was in opposition alert and dynamic, ever establishing, or even alleging, in opposition that that was the case. We have heard already from him that when he was in opposition he made the same kinds of attacks on the Fraser Government as we are now making on his Government. All I say to this Minister is that, if he were so alert, so dynamic, so aware of what was going on and so effective in opposition, why did he not make that sort of comment then? It is as inaccurate now as it was then. </PARA>

<PARA> There are many other issues I would like to raise. I hope that Senator Short will pursue some other matters. I want to give the examples which the Minister challenged me to give about the party political way in which this propaganda machine has acted, despite his instructions in the document he tabled, that representatives of NMLS will not work with local or State party branches and will not be involved in party programs or electoral campaigning. I will give the Minister examples. They are given in the back of the documents which the Minister has provided to us. I look forward to having an opportunity of debating this matter in a few minutes, after Senator Short gives a further contribution. </PARA>

Quite frankly, I cannot accept them unless he can source them. It is very unfair of him to come in here and set up straw men and knock them over and then say that I have been misleading the chamber with those answers. He has never had such honest answers on the National Media Liaison Service since he has been asking questions, because I have asserted that the National Media Liaison Service is there to support government, not the oppositions, that its members are not public servants but they do support government policy. That is their role on a ministerial staff, the same as any other ministerial staffers or Opposition staff holders. They are, however, precluded, and they should be precluded, from being actively involved in party campaigning in, say, by-elections, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Michael Baume said in his remarks, many of these answers, or answers to several of the outstanding questions, arrived on our desks about 10 minutes before this debate started. And, as was said in interjections across the chamber, had the appropriations been passed in the timescale that the Government was looking for, namely earlier this week at the latest, we would not have had these answers. I accept the statement of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) that there was not a conspiracy involved in this. I know the Minister acts in good faith, but that does not detract from the point that despite the amount of time involved in a lot of these matters-and I accept there is a lot of time involved-it is more than four weeks since the Estimates Committee hearings ended. That is a lengthy period. I do not resile at all from my earlier statement that it is wrong for this chamber to have to debate Appropriation Bills with outstanding questions not answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make that as a general comment, not just of the Department of Administrative Services, as it happens with many departments. Indeed, last year I recall during the appropriations debate that we in fact refused to pass the appropriations for the Department of Defence because there had been questions outstanding for up to 12 months, I think, from the previous Estimates Committee hearing. We refused to let the appropriations pass until those questions were forthcoming. Surprise, surprise, those questions which had been outstanding for 12 months or more suddenly came forward in the space of, I think, 24 hours. So I am making a general point-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and the statute of limitations would not apply in those circumstances. I have not had a chance to look at the answers that have just been received as closely as I would have wished. One of the questions was from me and concerned consultants on the staff of Ministers. On the very brief look that I have had at the answers now provided, I must say that I am absolutely staggered at the amount of money being spent by this Government in putting consultants onto the staffs of Ministers. The answer that I have got says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the year 1 July 87 to 30 June 88, 60 consultants were employed by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual costs of consultants on the staffs of Ministers has gone up since 1984-85, when the figure was $364,000. In the year just completed, 1987-88, that figure has gone to $1.9m, and this year the appropriation for 1988-89 is only $14,000 short of $2m for consultants. That is a staggering figure. It is a figure which I think I am correct in saying has never been fully identified in the Estimates figures and the appropriations figures. I think it has been included in an administrative item but I am not sure it has been itemised in the way it has now been. But whether it has or has not is not the question. The point I want to make is that that is another enormous addition to the resources of the Government in a way that is not made fully manifest to the Australian public. It is, in my view, another scandalous use of taxpayers money when one looks at some of the people who have been involved in those consultancies and the length of time they have been involved. It is obviously a scam way of getting around staffing levels in Ministers' offices. Some of those consultants have been employed as consultants for more than three years. Peter Steedman has been a consultant for 3 years and 2 months. David McKenzie, who I think was a former Labor member of the House of Representatives--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. However, my main point is the length of time that a David McKenzie has been a consultant. The consultancy started in January 1986. He had an 18 months consultancy which took him to July 1987. In January 1988 he was taken on for another year. Helen Mayer, the former member for Chisholm who was defeated at the last election, was employed by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly). She gave Helen Mayer a job for a period of 12 months initially, from September 1987, a couple of months after Mrs Mayer was defeated at the election. That has been extended for a couple of months. That consultancy is based in Melbourne and its purpose is to undertake two tasks. The first is to look into the disparities faced by service personnel and families caused through inter-State transfers. The second is to look into the educational difficulties facing children of Defence Force members. Why that study was undertaken by a person who may or may not have the relevant qualifications for such a study is beyond me. It has never been explained. It is obviously an opportunity to give jobs for the boys and girls of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one flips through these pages quickly and looks at the names of the consultants shown in the answers to these questions, one finds that many of them are apparatchiks of the Labor machine who have been around for a long time. The Government is paying out taxpayers money in a way which is hidden. These people are not on staff. They are consultants. If the Government is going to be fair dinkum why does it not put them in an established position? It is part of the matter that Senator Michael Baume and myself have been talking about this morning in terms of the enormous resources that this Government has put into staff for purely political purposes as distinct from governmental purposes. That in my view is a scandalous misuse of public money.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins may assist in a moment and list all the consultants used by the Northern Territory Government. This is not a secret process. At least each year, maybe every six months, we table in this Parliament a list of all the consultants and their duties. That is a good process because it allows Senator Short and others to ask, `Are they justified?'. There is nothing secret about employing consultants. That is the normal practice. They are properly approved by Cabinet. Some Ministers find consultancies in specific areas very useful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could go back to the old Fraser days, of course, when the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet set up mini-departments to check on what the other departments were doing. Talk about a waste of resources! That was one of the most massive wastes of resources. But Malcolm did not trust anyone. So he used to have replicated in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet all the people overlooking the other departments. It was far more costly than consultants. Consultants are there for a specific reason, to work on specific projects. Senator Short complains that it might be jobs for the boys and defeated members of parliament. There is always a tendency for any government to look after its own in that regard. I do not want to go through all the Liberal appointments to ambassadorial posts, to appointments as Administrator of the Northern Territory, Christmas Island, with Mr Yates, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> But in one general defence of both governments I have to say this: quite often members of parliament, given their experience in these chambers, are very well suited to these jobs. I have often referred to this chamber and the other chamber, to the whole place, as the most extensive tertiary institution in the country where people are continually educated on a whole series of issues and administrative skills that serve them well when they go to government jobs. I have always been a supporter of ex-members of parliament becoming diplomats, becoming administrators and being put back into the system because of their great knowledge and experience. It is often seen as a reward. No doubt that is an element in both governments' thinking, in my view, that one looks after one's own when a person has been defeated, as long as it does not get to the point-Senator Short may allege it does; I deny it though-of rampant cronyism or giving people jobs just so they have jobs. People have to be criticised if it gets to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the longer a government goes the more open it is to that sort of criticism. Consultancies are a thing of the current day. Again, harping back to the dreaded years of 1981-82, we used to ask a lot of questions about consultants and computers and why the cost for them was always going up. The sorts of answers I give now Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle gave then. Nothing changes. Maybe in six years time Senator Short will be giving me the same answers from this side. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.28)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just make a quick response to that because I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not objecting to the use in a consultancy role of certain people who may have skills because of having had a parliamentary background or whatever. I accept the point the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) made, that some of those people are very well suited to diplomatic posts and other such things. My great concern is twofold. The first issue relates to the extraordinary growth in the use of consultants by this Government. There has been more than a five-fold increase in spending on consultants on ministerial staffs in the last four years. That is an enormous increase in expenditure. The consultancy work that is done-I am sure Senator Robert Ray would agree with me on this-by a person who is attached to a Minister's staff is a vastly different thing from the Government having a consultant to undertake a specific project. They are like chalk and cheese. My first point therefore relates to the enormous increase in expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is that genuine consultancies on a ministerial staff-I do not deny they might arise from time to time-could not conceivably run for the length of time that many of these consultancies have. The employment of Mr Steedman for three years is not a consultancy; that is employing a person on a ministerial staff. Presumably because the Government does not have a position for him on the establishment, it calls it a consultancy. In my view that is a very improper way to run a ministerial consultancy service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which is different from the matters that have been raised this morning. It concerns some statements which were made by Senator Sheil earlier this year. Not all of my comments are directed to Senator Sheil because some of the matters he mentioned could conceivably have some effect on my staff and the staff of other Queensland members of this Parliament. I have asked my staff about some of the matters that were raised and they do not seem to be having any problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go back to 17 October when Senator Sheil asked a question of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) who is in the chamber at the moment. Amongst other things Senator Sheil spoke about a new computer system to streamline payments and salaries. He then went on to say that the system was failing and some employees were waiting many weeks to collect their travelling allowances. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, they are digging into their own pockets to work for the Government. One of my own staff is still awaiting travelling allowances dating back to July; another waited seven weeks for a pay cheque. </PARA>
<PARA>I checked with my own staff and they tell me that if they ask for their travelling allowances in advance these are always paid into their bank accounts on the day on which they are requested. They do say that if they happen to be away a day longer than they anticipated, and ask for extra travelling allowance for that day, that is not paid in advance, of course, and it takes some time to arrive. Has Senator Ray or the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) made any inquiries about this to see whether staff are digging into their own pockets for travelling allowances when they fail to make application in advance or make application after they complete their term of duty?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise some other matters which are slightly connected. The following day in the Senate Senator Ray made a statement about Senator Sheil's staff and, amongst other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1 July 1988 Senator Sheil has notified the Department of two new staff. In respect of the first, the Department made the first salary payment within five days of being notified of her commencement. In respect of the second, the Department was formally advised on 10 August 1988 that some staff member had been employed since 13 April 1987-some 16 months later. </PARA>
<PARA>I was in the chamber when that was mentioned and I was sure that an error had been made and the date of 13 April 1987 was really meant to be 13 April 1988. Subsequently letters were tabled which indicated that my understanding was incorrect and the date was 13 April 1987. I wonder whether any investigations have been made about the fact that a person was working in Senator Sheil's office for 16 months without pay and then a request was made for that person to go on staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to make the point that the following day-19 October-Senator Sheil made a personal explanation in which he claimed to have been misrepresented. At the end of his remarks the President said that they were hardly a personal explanation, but rather a statement. In that personal explanation or statement Senator Sheil said:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray also informed the Senate that a staff member I employed earlier this year was paid within five days of commencing duty. Again, that is completely incorrect. The staff member did not receive her first pay packet until seven weeks after she started. </PARA>
<PARA>There seems to me to be some misunderstanding by Senator Sheil about when this person started and when the Department was contacted. Have investigations been made into the situation with travel allowances and the 16-month delay in notifying the Department of staff changes? Also did that staff member receive her pay packet seven weeks after she started or within five days of the Department being notified? Can Senator Ray throw any light on these matters?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that staff are encouraged to get the travel allowance in advance, so that it can be paid very quickly. Normally if it is not paid in advance or a claim is submitted for an extra day, there is approximately a 30-day delay. As I acknowledged at the time, a new system was introduced in Queensland so there could have been slightly longer delays but we believe that any of the technical hitches there have now been solved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Colston also made the point that someone had not been paid for seven weeks. That was because the Department had not been notified of her being on the staff. On notification of coming on staff that person was paid within five days. Whilst Senator Sheil has never clarified that issue, he quite clearly misquoted me in this chamber by saying that I was wrong when I said that only five days had passed. The parliamentary and ministerial services section of the Department of Administrative Services cannot pay people unless it knows they are on the payroll. It does not have osmosis or extra sensory perception or any other ability to divine that someone is working. It was only in the course of all that that other letters came to light, indicating that another staff member had apparently been appointed, as Senator Colston said, some time in April 1987. This was not known to the Department until that person wished to travel to Canberra some time in 1988. It was explained to that person that she could only be put on the staff when Senator Sheil sent a letter saying that she was on the staff. As it was, even that took another three months or so to arrive. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil explained that the reason why the person had not notified that she was on the staff from about 13 April was her own business. But in a letter to the Department the explanation given was that her appointment had not been notified because for the last 16 months the honourable senator had been too busy to notify the Department that she was working. We do not ever not take the word of a member of parliament but clearly the Department wrote to Senator Sheil quite a long time ago asking for some substantiation that the person worked from April 1987 right through. It would not surprise Senator Colston to hear that there has been no response. I know Senator Sheil is very busy but I would have thought that that matter being one of public controversy that he sparked off by his accusations, which then backfired on him, one would at least have expected him to respond to that letter. No such response is yet forthcoming, no back pay has been paid and the mystery remains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would just like to follow that up a little. I have here a copy of the letter dated 11 July 1988, which was tabled in the Senate, in which an employee of Senator Sheil said, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Attached find Pro forma agreement for a member of Electorate staff. </PARA>
<PARA> This letter is by way of explanation for the delay in submitting form. </PARA>
<PARA> I commenced working with the Senator on Monday 13 April 1987-commuting each day between my home in Brisbane and the office in Surfers Paradise. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Senator was away in Canberra and various parts of the Electorate and the forms were not completed. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Ray mentioned, the letter said:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation has now arisen that Senator Sheil requires me to travel to Canberra on various occasions and consequently the forms are essential for a number to be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what that means. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Please advise if there is anything overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>I think something was probably overlooked for about 16 months, but I do not think that is what the staff member meant. The Minister alluded to the fact that back payment was requested by Senator Sheil, not by the staff member; but I would like to know this: if the Department had not been notified for 16 months that this person was on the staff and was travelling daily between the suburb of Annerley in Brisbane and Surfers Paradise and returning, as was claimed in the letter, and if that person happened to have an accident on the way to work or on the way home from work, would that person be covered by workers compensation? It is not a question that I ask idly, because I often travel on that road between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. A lot of drivers on that road regard themselves as rally drivers rather than ordinary drivers and it is a road on which there are a fair number of accidents. I ask: Under those circumstances would that person be covered by workers compensation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister must have been a little confused about what I thought I had said fairly clearly, cleanly and directly when he responded with his image of injured innocence. I commend him for that presentation. I think he does that even better than being quick on his feet, which he is so good at as well. But this injured innocence does not lie too well with what I actually said. I did not deny that, when he was in opposition, there was debate on the previous Government's press services. He ,gave a fanciful response. I said that there were no complaints that I know of of journalists, in effect, masquerading as ordinary staff members in other Ministers' offices, because that is the implication of his response. I draw the attention of the Minister to this, because he has just gone off on the wrong tram. And I do not want to be inundated with calls from Feathers McLaren, thanks; although it was a very kind offer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am just telling the Minister the facts. I know that he will not be accustomed to dealing with them, but I am telling him the facts. The fact is that the answer I quoted said it is difficult to make a direct comparison between the number of press secretaries employed by Ministers of the Fraser Government and the number of press secretaries employed by Ministers in the present Government, as a number of journalists and media staff were employed by Ministers in the Fraser Government in positions not described as press secretaries. That was the issue that I regarded as phoney when I responded to this. I said that I did not recall complaints of that nature, that journalists were masquerading as ordinary staff members, being raised by the Minister when he was in opposition. If he can demonstrate that not to be so, good luck to him. But do not come up with some phoney straw man and burn it down, as he accused me of putting up a phoney straw man. Two can play that game, Minister. I will join him at it any time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to what the Minister said at Estimates Committee E. The official having described what the cost of the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS) is, Senator Robert Ray went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That figure compares fairly favourably with the 1982-83 budget allocation for the Government Information Unit-its predecessor . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to describe what the costs would be in current terms. The Chairman said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except, I suppose, that it bore no relation to the question; I do not know. The point is that I then took the Minister to task in effect by saying, `Come on, it is not realistic or accurate to describe this as its predecessor, because of the enormously different functions involved'. I pursued the Minister over that. If he reads the Hansard he will see that I was saying, `Come on, there are different functions'. In other words, I was saying that the Minister was being misleading simply to describe it as its predecessor, simply give its costs and simply compare it. That was the whole thrust of the questioning. The Minister, being very quick on his feet, then recognised that that was the thrust of the question, and we can tell from his subsequent non-answers that he recognised the thrust of the question. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Could I ask the Minister, in view of that interesting information, whether the duties are exactly comparable. </PARA>
<PARA>His non-answer was to provide a list of the current duties without indicating whether they were comparable whatsoever. His non-answers were to continue after I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of my question related to functions. As you would recognise, Minister, the functions of ministerial press secretaries and/or departmental press assistants given to Ministers would be similar to many of the functions which you have just attributed to the previous group but which are not carried out by this present Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response was:</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the functions are different of course, not the least being to do political work . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, would you say that the $1.135m is only a fraction of the cost of the Government's media and press relations bill in respect of its ministerial and other promotional effort?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's non-answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>It relates to a specific purpose. There are other expenditures for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was creating the totally false impression that its predecessor-the implication being the predecessor in respect of all its functions-was expending even more in current terms than the present one. If the Minister is prepared to put a different gloss on that, that is up to him. All I am saying is that that, combined with his comment today that there is very little difference between the coalition and Labor operations as if they are exactly comparable-and the Minister should have a look at today's Hansard-shows that the Minister is misleading the people of Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Senator Harradine cannot get information about the Estimates. But that is not all. The Record of Government is also published. Federal Insight and Rural Focus are published on an irregular basis. Apparently the Minister has not been taking his All Bran. The latest issue of Record of Government is dated 1986, the latest Federal Insight is dated 20 October 1988, and the latest Rural Focus was published in October 1988. All these publications are sent to Labor members of parliament from an organisation whose duty is to provide local members of all parties with details of government programs and assist their media presentation. So if the Minister wants an indication of the extent to which the guidelines appear to have been broken on party political lines, that seems to be a bit of evidence from the horse's mouth. To the questions we asked about whether NMLS staff had been to various places, whether they had participated in referendums or moved into various States at different times, the Minister said that all the questions had been answered and the answer was no. I have flagged these answers. I wanted to deal with them because I was intrigued at the wording differences between the answers and the actual questions. For example, I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Are any additional or temporary staff employed by the National Media Liaison Service at election time? Do voluntary or unpaid workers use the facilities of the National Media Liaison Service at election time; either voluntary or non-paid workers?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is carefully different from the question. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>No extra staff were employed for the period of the 1987 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>That deals with the first question. The answer to the next question states:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Media Liaison Service does not have `voluntary staff'. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not ask whether it had voluntary staff; I asked whether any volunteers from the Labor Party came in to use the expensive equipment, the faxes, the telephones, the free lines to Townsville-heaven knows why it has these people in Townsville, but I will go into that in a minute-and all the electronic equipment of major use in an election campaign. I asked whether anyone came in to use it. I did not ask, `Do you have voluntary staff?'. It would be nice if I got a straightforward answer to what seemed to me to be a straightforward question. I also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>On how many occasions do staff members of the National Media Liaison Service, who are not based in New South Wales, visit New South Wales during the New South Wales election campaign?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer, again, slightly different from the question, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>No National Media Liaison Service staff member visited New South Wales at official expense during the New South Wales election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether it is impossible to find out whether any National Media Liaison Service people actually worked there. The fact that they were not visiting at official expense does not necessarily mean that they were not there being paid for their normal jobs but doing their normal jobs in Sydney rather than in some other centre. Does the use of the words `at official expense' mean that no-one was working there? I will not suggest that staff members were sufficiently generous to give up their holidays to work although I suppose they would all recognise that if their party lost the election they would lose their jobs. As I recall, all the members of our media group lost their jobs when the Government changed. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is running on I will refer to some other matters. The `animals' I refer to are nine top journalists earning about as much as a member of parliament. The top salary, including the ministerial staff allowance, is $52,251. That is more than members of parliament get. So it is a pretty highly paid propaganda operation. It is a beauty. The propaganda machine is getting more than members of parliament and I presume it is because the Minister takes the view that it is more effective. </PARA>

I invite him to go back to the Hansard to find where that was said at Estimates Committee E. He has glossed over it. He has not found it because it is not there. He attempted to quote the answer that we have provided showing the figures 16 and 30 and said that I had misled the Committee but my comments were directed very specifically-and Senator Baume knows this and should acknowledge it-to the staffing levels and cost of the Government Information Unit and the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS).

The real problem is that he did not ask the right questions. If the honourable senator had gone on to ask me, `What I want to know is how much money, in terms of salary and administrative expenses, total press effort in this Government is costing compared with the Fraser Government' and then put the amount at either 1983 dollars or 1988 dollars we would have had some reason to compare. Then he went on to distort my response by saying that my well-held view that there is not much difference between the two is again misleading the chamber.

However, I noted one question from Senator Short which sparked my interest. He referred to a newspaper article that suggested that maybe we should have a transfer of responsibility in this area away from the Department of Administrative Services to the portfolio of Senator Richardson-the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Given that I would rather not have to waste two hours here on this when I have meetings planned, I certainly will suggest that Senator Richardson take over this area. As I handed Defence to him in this chamber, I might hand this to him. That suggestion has some merit so that we can have some senatorial supervision over this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond very briefly to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). He asked why I did not ask the right question. The question I asked was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . how many press secretaries were employed by Ministers of that Fraser Government, as against the number of press secretaries employed by this Government?</PARA>
<PARA>I asked what was their total cost in salary and administrative expenses. That is exactly the question he just accused me of not asking. I did not get an answer to it, of course. The Minister's reply states:</PARA>
<PARA>Salary and administrative costs for press secretaries cannot readily be extracted from the total costs of staff employed by all Ministers, office holders, senators and members. </PARA>
<PARA>So I asked the right question; the Minister just did not answer it. So it is a bit quaint to say that I did not ask the right question. The excuse was that the information cannot readily be extracted. Earlier today the Minister said that it would involve immense cost. When one asks the right question and one does not get an answer, it is additional hypocrisy for the Minister to say that one did not ask the right question; we have had plenty of that today. I ask the Minister, in that case: what was the cost of providing the partial answer that I received today relating to the numbers? I would not think it would be very much. I do not think the time taken would be very long. Perhaps he could explain why we got it 10 minutes before the debate began. The question was asked on 19 October. It took from 19 October until the beginning of December for the Department to give us the information that there were 16 ministerial press secretaries or the equivalent back in 1983 compared with 30 now. Of course, as I said earlier, that 30 left off the 16 back-up staff. That really lifts the current number to 46. I do not know what the back-up staff would have been in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of why there are more National Media Liaison Service (NMLS) staff-`animals'-in Queensland. Why are there four `animals' in Queensland and two in New South Wales, two in Victoria, et cetera? There are five in Canberra. I can understand that. After all, the lion tamers are in Canberra so that is where one would assume the `animals' would be. I ask the Minister: What is the motive for having, in population terms, a massive concentration of `animals' per head of population in Queensland as against any other State? What criteria determine where the `animals' should be caged? I would be interested to hear his response. During Senate Estimates hearings I also asked the Minister whether `animals' would be available, as it says in his answer, to provide local members of all parties with details and assist their media presentation; whether that assistance would be available to members of the coalition in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray is so sensitive now it is essential to quote his exact words. I got the impression from him that that would be such a low priority on the list of `animals' ' priorities that one would be wasting one's time to ask for that assistance. Maybe the Minister will say that that is an unfair assessment of what he had to say. But basically he was saying that one would be wasting one's time to ask `animals' to do what his memorandum requires them to do. The Minister says to the chamber, `Give us examples of this dreadful political bias'. The fact is that his own answers indicate it quite clearly. As he stresses, these people are not public servants; they are working for the Government. They are working for the Government in power and they are working in a political way, as journalists themselves have said in the article referred to. They say, when asked, that it is true that they act in a particularly political propagandising manner, a manner in which they did not work back in 1983 under Mr Young. There has been a clear change in emphasis and style, a doubling in total media assistance staff from the number under Fraser, a change in the actual nature and operation of the NMLS since Mr John Brown became responsible for it and employed Mr Parks. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The facts are simple: this Government has created a propaganda machine. It sought to hide the cost of it originally in the documents. One had to ask questions to find out what the costs were. It has as its director a person who is directly employed not by the Department of Administrative Services, where these people reside-they are not on the normal strength-and hidden in the allocations for the Department of Administrative Services; it is run by someone who is employed by the Government's own media operation. In my mind the wearing of the two hats by the director clearly establishes the political propagandising nature of the organisation. This is a curious way to operate this body and it is even more curious that this organisation hides behind the pretence of a memorandum signed by this Minister saying that it is to provide local members of all parties with details and that it will not be involved in party programs when the evidence clearly shows that it is and has been, and even more will be, under this Minister, judging from the responses we have received in the debate today.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a dramatic, massive staffing of four compared with two elsewhere! This demonstrates our commitment to far north Queensland, which most people regard as a separate State anyway.

We are tired of a situation in which one can take a bag full of money-$250,000 we heard earlier this week-and be issued with a $53m contract. We have become immune to all that sort of thing. Even Senator Baume could understand that trying to get government information out of Queensland would have been a difficult thing from a Federal level, given the type of operation Bjelke-Petersen had in Queensland. I imagine that is it. I must say that it never occurred to me to inquire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume complains that one aspect of the memorandum has not been adhered to. Certainly I will take the time today to draw that again to the attention of the director. I will remind him of item (c) in the memorandum and tell him to make sure that all local members are given this information. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the real furphy lies in Senator Baume's remarks about assisting local members in promoting government policy. I really do not think that any honourable senators opposite or any Opposition members in the House of Representatives are going to call upon the National Media Liaison Service to help them promote government policy. Basically those opposite are not, or would rarely be, big supporters of government policy. That is a furphy, and I think Senator Baume realises that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I take Senator Baume's first point in relation to item (c) of the memorandum. I take his word that he has not been given the information. As I say, I will draw it to the attention of the director. I did not sign the memorandum as a joke. The direction was meant to be carried out. I still maintain that in relation to party campaigning it has been carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw the attention of the Committee to the actual cost of the referendums this year. I do so because, if people took the Estimates Committee E Hansard at face value, they would get a considerable understatement of the actual cost of the referendums. During the Estimates Committee hearings, when the Australian Electoral Commission officers were being examined, Senator Durack asked for the cost of the referendums. The Electoral Commissioner said that the cost would be a whisker over $37m. That figure, I presume, is accurate so far as the Electoral Commission is concerned, but it needs to be pointed out that the actual cost of the referendums was considerably greater than $37m. That does not include the $3m that was spent on the Government's advertising campaign. Two of the four advertisements in that campaign were found to be illegal and the Government had to change those illegal advertisements to make them conform with the provisions of the Electoral Act. That was quite an extraordinary thing to have happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was extraordinary that in the Estimates Committee hearings we were told that the Electoral Commission, which has responsibility for the administration of the Electoral Act and therefore matters pertaining to the legality of advertising for elections and referendums, had not even been consulted in the preparation of the Government's advertising campaign. It was only as a result of the Commission's own initiative that legal opinion was sought by the Commission which led to two of the four advertisements being ruled illegal. It was an absolutely classic case of the left hand of the Government not knowing what the right hand was doing. So there is a $3m addition to the $37m that was mentioned by Dr Hughes in the Estimates hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional $6m has to be added for the cost of the conduct of the Constitutional Commission, a body which this Government set up three years ago to try to give the Government a mandate to rewrite the Constitution in a way which would fit the Australian Labor Party's long term agenda for this country. When we add that figure, we have a minimum cost for the referendums of $46m. </PARA>
<PARA> This $46m was absolutely wasted, for two reasons. Firstly, the referendums were never really likely to get up. One would have to say that in retrospect. History has now shown that unless both major parties support proposals for constitutional change those proposals will not get up, and it is an absolute waste of money on the Government's part to attempt to get them up. The second reason it was an absolute waste of money is that there was no earthly reason for running the referendums separately from a general election. Had they been run in conjunction with the next Federal election their cost would have been minimal compared with the extraordinarily extravagant waste that was incurred this year. I believe that the referendums were yet another example of the extraordinary sense of priorities of this Government. When it comes to allocating taxpayers' funds, the priorities of this Government seem to be absolutely out of line with the values and needs of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the estimates for Parliament House Construction Authority. During Estimates Committee E hearings I asked whether there were many outstanding problems to be resolved in terms of equipment and so on that was not working in the new Parliament House. Apparently, as a result of a misunderstanding of my question, the response was that there were not many outstanding problems to be resolved. I then went through a list of them. There was an enormous number of items regarding which there were problems, particularly in the food area. Is it possible to get a correct answer, instead of the incorrect answer I got in the Estimates Committee hearing, relating to the hot-presses which were supposed to keep food warm in the dining room?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There have been continual complaints about the coldness of food served in the dining room. To what extent is this related to the fact that the hot-presses, especially designed as a one-off operation, did not work? The answer given in the Estimates Committee hearing was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problems are basically derived from the fact that they were one-off items; they were not proprietary items. We resolved the problems, we thought, and had them to everyone's satisfaction. Unfortunately, the user decided to change his operation so that they would not be used at all. I understand that was due to some industrial pressure from his own staff. Our response to that has since been to say, `Even though you do not want to use them in your operational sequences, we will get them fixed up to the full extent of the contract'. That would include having the doors rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>Having pursued this matter, my understanding is that the items were condemned because of heat problems and particularly the risk of fire. I would be grateful if we were advised of the real situation. I have also been given a clear impression by officers of the Joint House Department that the Parliament will be required to suffer considerable cost burdens resulting from major renovations and changes to equipment and areas in Parliament House that are not satisfactory. I would be grateful to get some kind of indication of what the additional costs are that the Parliament is likely to face as a result of the Joint House Department finding that there are matters which have not been adequately resolved by the Construction Authority, and whether the Construction Authority has been discussing these problems with the Joint House Department representatives or any other relevant persons. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I ask: What was the problem which involved the digging up and destroying of large slabs of black marble in the main corridor to the Senate a couple of weeks ago? It was evident, after this black marble had been dug up, that electricity junction boxes were covered in water. I have seen now that sections of that black marble floor have been replaced with a totally different colour of black marble. When renovations, repairs or corrections of this nature take place-obviously, it is inevitable that repairs will have to be done-is it going to involve the destruction of very expensive items, like black marble, and their replacement with items that do not appear to be of the same colour or nature?</PARA>
<PARA> I also draw to the Committee's attention the fact that the indentation of the floor, particularly of the Great Hall, by the heels of women's shoes is going to require, as we found in Senate Estimates Committee hearings, a major sanding operation over the Christmas period. I am afraid I cannot recall how much this will cost, but I wondered whether it would be necessary to take the same action in all the other wooden corridors in Parliament House and who would meet the cost of that major sanding and resurfacing, or refacing, that is to go on. Is such work a result of unexpected wear? In other words, is it the responsibility of the Joint House Department to correct that extraordinary wear, or was it entirely expected within the contract of the supplier?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Parliament House Construction Authority happy that that flooring is adequate and meets the requirements of the Construction Authority, and it is what the Construction Authority would have regarded as totally acceptable? Having sanded and resurfaced the Great Hall after less than a year of activity-five months of sittings of the Parliament-what will be the result of the resurfacing? Will it then last for a long time? Can it be done better, or will this job be required to be done every six months or so, presumably at enormous expense to the Parliament?</PARA>

Regarding the lifting of the marble slabs, my advice is that that would have been a contract defect and the expense would have been incurred by the contractor rather than taxpayers. As for the pockmarking of the wooden floors around Parliament House, there are no plans, to my knowledge, to do anything about that-in the Great Hall or anywhere else. There are no plans for any sanding, as far as I know, and that has been confirmed by the officials who are present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it should not take longer than five minutes. The matter which concerns me is this: on 7 October I sought details of figures and costs relating to Mr Hayden's undertakings in that month-what was a thoroughly unnecessary and unjustifiable overseas junket which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the time laughingly chose to describe as a `familiarisation tour'; that being, of course, by someone who had already chalked up no fewer than 41 trips in a period of just over five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked for the information on 7 October. During three meetings of the Estimates Committee I was not provided with that information, other than to be given on 13 October some information to the effect that it was not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs of the trip until Mr Hayden returned to Australia. Mr Hayden himself had proposed the countries to be visited and the dates, his staff had made detailed arrangements, and the Department had not been involved in the arrangements of his itinerary. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, I have been patiently awaiting receipt of that additional information. Yesterday evening, at 7.20 p.m.-bearing in mind that the Senate was scheduled to adjourn at 7.30 p.m.-material was provided to me by way of an addendum to answers which purported to give a detailed budget breakdown of the Governor-General-designate's overseas trip. That indicated that air fares had been of the order of $23,000; accommodation and meals amounted to $23,805; and transport and other incidental expenses amounted to $13,249-a total of $60,397. I was further told that it was possible, but not expected, that further accounts may come to hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The note also confirms that it was almost entirely a private venture and that the only official visits or portions of the trip that could be classified as official commitments were a call by Mr Hayden on the Governor of Hong Kong; a luncheon function in New York in honour of the President of Fiji; and a cup of tea at Buckingham Palace. One would assume that each of those matters were paid for. Nonetheless, the cost of accommodation and meals for Mr and Mrs Hayden and a departmental officer average out a approximately $1,600 per day. Transport and other expenses amount to almost $1,000 per day. My inquiries indicated that the `other' includes a $63 a day incidental allowance which is normally provided to Ministers and which was generously provided in this instance to Mr Hayden. Presumably, it was provided tax-free and went straight into his pocket. These figures indicate that Mr Hayden has certainly gone for broke. I can understand why there is a very great degree of sensitivity. But what concerns me above all is that I think the facts as they are indicate a very serious conspiracy, which involved Mr Hayden, to withhold information from this chamber and the public in the hope that it would go unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the exquisite sensitivity and embarrassment of the public revelation that a humble working class boy from the backblocks of Queensland managed to rack up $1,600 a day for accommodation and meals, together with $1,000 a day for car hire and incidentals, but the fact is that that information was sought last Wednesday on the basis that this debate would take place last Friday. At 5 p.m. last Friday the Department indicated that it was in possession of the information, that it had already been discussed with Mr Hayden but that it wanted to check one further matter. There was no further communication until last evening. I put this to honourable senators: it is quite clear that the Department withheld that information until it was aware that the debate on Estimates Committee A had concluded and that the information was then conveyed via the Government Whip's office, which is not the normal course of events. It should have been provided in the mail to the Secretary of that Estimates Committee. Nonetheless, it was provided at a time when it must have been clear to all concerned that there was a very good prospect that most senators would not be interested in the matter as they would be preoccupied with Christmas parties and the like and the Senate was due to rise shortly. In fact, the material was provided to me at 7.20 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that Mr Hayden was consulted again yesterday morning. It is quite clear that Mr Hayden is no political tyro. He had enough nous to call off the trip, but he also had 20-plus years in the Parliament and more than five years as Leader of the Opposition, and he would have been acutely aware of the timing and sensitivity of this material. It is clear to me that Mr Hayden was actively involved in the attempt to withhold this information from the Parliament. I regard that as a disgrace and I urge this chamber to require the Government to provide a full explanation of how this situation came about, why the information was not provided in the normal course of events, and why it took six weeks to come up with these figures, which must have been known to the Department, or could have been obtained by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the timing was exquisite. The first answer which said that it would not be possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs until Mr Hayden returned from Australia was given to me the day before Mr Hayden returned. Again, quite clearly, there has been an attempt at every stage to avoid providing this information, in the hope that at the last minute it would go unnoticed. It certainly has not. I believe it is a disgrace. The Government must come clean on this cover-up and explain precisely who it was that took the decision to withhold this information. Unless that is done, there will continue to be a very real question mark over Mr Hayden's fitness for office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter that I asked a question about the other day when the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) was absent. It relates to information that has now become available that the Special Investigations Unit is conducting a number of interviews with suspects or people whose names have been supplied to it as people who may have committed war crimes and who would be subject to war crimes legislation if it were ever passed by this Parliament. Such legislation has not yet been passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that I was primarily concerned to obtain an answer on was how many of these suspects-we know from information the Minister gave at the Estimates Committee hearing that 500 files have been opened by that unit-have been interviewed by officers representing the Special Investigations Unit. I refer particularly to information which was given on the AM program last week by Frank Galbally in respect of one of these people who engaged him for legal advice in relation to the matter. I quote from the transcript of the interview with Mr Galbally on 24 November. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewer concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he says his client is not alone. He knows of at least two more in Melbourne, several others in Sydney and a further group in Canberra . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet at the same time we have had a person who is referred to as the spokesman for the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) saying that statements that people had been interrogated by officers of this unit are absolute nonsense. There are two conflicting matters of concern that I wanted to raise in this Committee. The first is: how many people, in view of the information that has been provided? Information has also been provided by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an important matter in the Senate today. Like my colleagues, I have been concerned for sometime about the question of Aboriginal projects in various parts of the north and north-western areas of New South Wales. I point out that I am not simply getting on a band wagon as a late convert. It is now over 12 months since I first raised the issue of funding for several Aboriginal schemes in New South Wales. I have raised the matter at Estimates committee meetings. In fact, I did so as early as a few years ago. I have given information to colleagues to enable them also to pursue these questions and I have put questions on notice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). I do not believe that I or the people of New South Wales have received satisfactory answers to any of the concerns that have been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the short time that I have available I do not propose to mention Toomelah because it has already been referred to in other debates in this place and has received widespread publicity. Some of the projects that worry me and many of my constituents, both black and white, include the Oasis Hotel at Walgett, the Nardoola farm project at Moree and the Tamworth district farm at Trelawney. Let me say at the outset that we are at a very sensitive stage in Australian race relations. We have a government which is fanning an immigration brawl out of a sheer desire to create feelings of bigotry and bias in an attempt to make the Opposition look bad-in my opinion, it is making itself look bad-without any consideration of the damage it is doing to Australia and Australians as a whole. As a result, one realises what little hope there is in trying to discuss such issues rationally with the appropriate Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation applies to Aborigines. Today, one has to be very careful if the subject of Aborigines is brought up in conversation to avoid being labelled as a `boong-basher' or a `black lover'. We have reached such a paranoid state that Australia is quickly being divided into two camps and any rational discussion of such things as funding for Aboriginal projects is fraught with risks of accusations and exaggeration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I have been very disturbed for some time at what is clearly not a normal business practice in the funding and running of such farms as Nardoola and Trelawney. For those who do not know, these two properties are located in the north-western areas of the State that I represent. They are funded by grants from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and, by their very location and the nature of funding, they are scrutinised carefully by both black and white people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Nardoola was bought by the ADC for the Aboriginal community at a cost of nearly $600,000. What has happened there has created understandable anger and resentment. Over a period of four years we have witnessed that farm deteriorate from a viable rural enterprise to a wasted opportunity. Houses were burnt, materials were either sold or stolen and the place is generally run down, abused and neglected. Little if anything positive came out of it. By 1986 the value of that farm dropped from $600,000 to $261,000. Public money poured in to this undertaking at a time when farmers in the district were going out backwards because they could not get financial relief, schools in the district were fighting for every penny they could for equipment and hospitals were desperately short of staff and resources. But, in any case, there was no excuse under any circumstances for such a blatant misuse of public money-the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC, for its part, justified this apparent failure by claiming the farm was never assessed for its commercial viability but, rather-and I quote from departmental advice-was regarded `as a social resource'. The fact that a viable operation was made in just four years a worthless, filthy mess appears not to worry the Department of Aboriginal Affairs at all. It is obvious why local feeling still runs high over the issue and the same resentment and anger would apply equally to a white man's project that was similarly abused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Oasis Hotel at Walgett is another example of lack of judgment, wasted public funding and local resident anger at such frivolous abuse of the public purse. The Oasis Hotel and the selection of appropriate people to run it also raise questions. A decision to hand the hotel over to the Barwon Aboriginal community, along with funds for operational purposes, was made earlier this year. There was concern at the time-and this concern continues-that the head of this group was not the most appropriate person to be running a hotel. There are allegations that the head of the Barwon community is facing a number of serious criminal charges, including assault. While this is common knowledge in the district, the Government, or at least the ADC, appears not to know or be concerned. I understand that that person is now not on that body. </PARA>
<PARA> People in the Walgett area also want to know why a high-speed sports boat was purchased for flood relief functions during the recent Walgett floods. I would have thought that, if such a boat were purchased, a speed boat would not be the most appropriate craft. I very much doubt that it would be the type of boat recommended for such a job. Where is the boat now, who is using it and for what purpose is it being used? Who paid for the boat and where did the money come from? Are taxpayers' funds being used in the best possible way?</PARA>
<PARA> I might point out that I am not the only person asking these questions. The Tamworth local Aboriginal Lands Council is also highly critical of the ADC. Its head, Mr Ivan Johnson, says that the ADC has ignored his group and poured money into unviable projects such as Nardoola and the Oasis Hotel when Aborigines in the area are homeless. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>We speak out for all Aborigines of Tamworth when we say you can't put all the homeless Aborigines into the hotel at Walgett or Nardoola or another broken down enterprise which was bought to help Aboriginal communities. Health, employment and housing are our main aims. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish this Government would correct the situation and put the money where it should be put-that is, into those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When local Aborigines complain that the ADC does not listen to them and does nothing for them, one begins to realise the extent of the rot that has set in. If this is happening in one town in one State, what must be happening time and again throughout Australia? It is not just a case of a few dollars being unwisely spent; it is a massive misappropriation of funds. The most naive interpretation of the ADC's lack of judgment is clumsy ineptitude. There could be far more sinister reasons behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> The result in the meantime is two properties in northern New South Wales that have been allowed to become rural slums and a closed hotel into which hundreds of thousands of dollars have been poured for little result. The Government's investigations must put a stop to this sort of rorting of the system. This sort of thing does the Aboriginal community little good and a great deal of adverse publicity and bad feelings are generated. The situation cannot be allowed to continue. I am at a loss to understand how a Minister, who supposedly has had total responsibility for all that has gone on, has been able to keep his job. It is obvious the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, either did not know what was going on, and so should be sacked for incompetence, or he did know, but for whatever reasons did nothing about it, and so should be sacked for lack of action and unsound political judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes afforded by this matter of public interest debate to mention some of the problems which I believe are still facing the car industry today. I think it is timely to make these remarks, given in the tabling yesterday in the Senate of the annual report of the Automotive Industry Authority. The Authority was established by the Government in October 1984 to oversee the implementation of the sectoral plan for the industry, now more commonly referred to as the Button car plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a concern, which I have expressed in this chamber when each previous report of the Authority has been tabled. The Authority publishes a document each year called Report on the state of the car industry which contains much useful information and statistics. However, the report of the Authority itself is fairly scant in its consideration of the state of the industry. It merely lists the balance sheet of the Authority, the membership and other short items. </PARA>
<PARA> This gives me the impression that the report is tabled each year only because of a statutory requirement. It does not even give a general picture of the industry. Nowhere does the report list the objectives of the Button car plan, nor does it report on the progress or implementation of the plan-both important elements which could be in the larger `state of the car industry' document and which, in my mind, are essential for any person who is really interested in the very existence of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> This very complex industry has been subject over the years to a degree of criticism, much of it well-founded but some of it is quite ignorant. The Prices Surveillance Authority recently undertook a reference into the price of replacement parts for motor cars. Some interesting remarks were made in its fourth government inquiry into car parts costs in the last 10 years. For instance, the average motor car is driven about 15,000 kilometres each year. Also, seven million cars are registered in Australia and this number grows by 3 per cent each year. Interestingly-and this reflects on the decline in the average man's standard of living over the past few years-the proportion of cars more than 10 years old has risen from 14 per cent to 30 per cent. We are becoming something like New Zealand. The spare parts market in this country is said to be worth about $2,600m per annum, added to which is another $2,000m for parts used in crash repairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also astounding to see the other statistics about the dramatic increase in the costs of motor vehicles. In 1984, the year in which the Button plan began, the price of a locally made six-cylinder family car was equivalent to 30.6 weeks of work for the average Australian, based on average weekly male earnings. In 1988 it took 41.4 weeks work to buy the cheapest Ford Falcon or Holden Commodore. It is true to say that a major reason for the increase in the cost of cars is the depreciation of the Australian currency, but there are other factors which play a role as well. If depreciation was the only factor, why would the price of television receivers, video cassette recorders and compact disc players be falling by as much as 10 per cent a year before inflation?</PARA>
<PARA> Many European and Japanese cars face a 42.5 per cent tariff and a 30 per cent sales tax which, in turn, makes them cripplingly expensive. For example, a Mercedes Benz 390E is priced at $70,000 in Australia but sells for $23,000 in West Germany-slightly more than the price here of a new base model Ford Falcon car. Similarly, the Mazda RX7 turbo sells in Australia for almost $53,650 while in Japan it costs $28,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Button car plan is drawing to the end of its lifespan. Many people in the industry and I are concerned that despite what I believe to be a genuine attempt by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to improve car manufacturing in Australia, the prices of Australian-made cars, imported cars and spare parts continue to rise at a much higher rate than earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is now time to look at some of the mechanisms available to us. For example, we could try to reduce the rate of the price hikes and to improve competition by reducing the level of the tariff and by making some quota adjustments. In fact, the industry remains fragile and, because of its size, can have a major effect on the general Australian economy. I hope that the concerns that I have drawn attention to are taken note of by the Authority and by the Minister who is responsible for this plan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the time that is usually set aside for lunch today, the Senate will be debating quite significant legislation to which there will be no amendments and on which divisions will not be called. The Opposition parties and the Australian Democrats will be supporting the legislation so that it can, in effect, be pushed through. But the fact that these significant Bills are all being debated and pushed through during this lunchtime is a criticism of the Government's agenda. Frankly, the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill 1988 is an excellent example of significant legislation. The fact that the Government is allowing this legislation to go through without any major debate is an indication of its attitude towards these matters. As I have indicated, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. However, because of the Government's ineptitude in arranging its business, we are forced to debate briefly this and other legislation that affects farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years, 2 to 3 per cent of farmers have left the land every year and today there are only 170,000 left in Australia. The productivity of those Australian farmers is between two and three times greater than in Australian industry generally. Yet, in 1985 the income of farmers in Australia as a whole was only one-third of average weekly earnings. This Government has placed heavy emphasis on restructuring of industry with little regard to the fact that manufacturing industries by comparison continue to be heavily protected. The Government has generated industry plans, such as the passenger motor vehicle plan, the textile, clothing and footwear plan and the steel plan, which include the acceptance of redundancy payments for those forced out of the industry. The aim of rural adjustment, which was introduced by the Menzies Government, is to accommodate and assist the adjustment process and alleviate the trauma of farmers not only leaving their occupation but also having to leave their homesteads. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to restrict the Commonwealth's role to the setting of the broad guidelines and giving the States greater flexibility, management and financial responsibility under the guidelines, should stop the notorious buck-passing which has been so much a part of the Commonwealth-State relations and the objectives of the scheme are now much more clearly defined in this new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill should facilitate structural change and assist, rather than impede, market forces. I hope that it will help the long term viability of those remaining in farming and lessen the trauma for those leaving the industry. Under the Bill, people will be able to receive household assistance for up to two years and those who choose to do so, subject of course to a means test, and who within six months realise that the sensible thing to do is to leave the farm, can receive assistance of up to $28,000. This means that such a person could leave the farm with a $28,000 grant plus up to $28,000 of his own original assets. This is not a lot of money, but at least it is some help to a farmer in dire straits; it is of some assistance in helping him to overcome the trauma of not only losing his occupation but also, as I have indicated, losing his home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also ensures that those States that administer the scheme proficiently will benefit from the scheme, whilst the State which makes unwise decisions will have less money to assist those it is intended to benefit. That is, of course, a great incentive to better management by the States. Overall, as I have said, the Bill should stop the buck-passing and ensure smoother restructuring within the industry. I hope it will serve the farming community well. The Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately a package of rural industry related Bills-namely, the Triticale Levy Collection Bill 1988, the Triticale Levy Bill 1988, the Rural Industries Research Amendment Bill 1988 and the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1988. Of course, the major Bill is the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1988. This Bill implements those aspects of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport relating to the development of a more cost effective grain distribution system by changing the terms of operation of the Australian Wheat Board. The Royal Commission made three sets of specific recommendations-one concerning storage and handling, one concerning land transport and one concerning ports and shipping. This legislation alters the requirements in respect of the Australian Wheat Board by removing the sole receiver requirement for the Board in dealing with wheat storage in each of the States-that is, it removes the State bulk handling monopoly for the storage of wheat relating to the Wheat Board in each State. Secondly, it requires the Wheat Board to maximise net returns to growers and, thirdly, it requires the Board to disaggregate costs. The Bill has the strong support of the Grains Council of Australia, the Australian Wheat Board and the Federal coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation should not be confused with other wheat legislation that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), tried to cast some aspersions on yesterday in answer to a dorothy dix question in this place. This Government is trying to deregulate the domestic wheat market by allowing the big boys to come in and grind some of the farmers into the ground and by using the first and the weakest seller as a basis for the floor price for wheat in Australia. That is different legislation altogether so I will not confuse anyone by referring to it at length. But the Opposition does support the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill, which is before us at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address myself to the triticale levy Bills. The triticale industry is a developing grain producing industry. Of course, those who were lucky enough to see the head of triticale that I produced in this chamber a few days ago now know a lot more about this grain than they did before. Triticale was developed by crossing wheat and rye and it is the hybrid of the genus name for the wheat triticum and rye secale. It can also be grown in a harsher or more marginal area than that used for wheat. Therefore, it is a little different from some of the other crops. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a series of problems in producing a successful commercial crop of triticale and for the last 40 years scientists have spent endless hours trying to perfect the breeding of a satisfactory hybrid. Research has continued with little help from the Government until now. Of course, the Government has been responsible for the cancellation of many of the research activities related to farming that were carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). But this Bill, which the Government is putting up, is going to help the triticale growers. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, there has been only a voluntary levy arrangement, and this is a credit to the growers. In line with the voluntary levy for research into chemical residues in our beef, our farming community has again shown that, unlike the Government, it is prepared to take responsibility for its own affairs. The farming community always takes responsibility for its own affairs and that is why it does not want to see a lot of changes to the wheat industry, which I should not even be talking about in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative levy being discussed today is included in the special rural research funding arrangements and involves the Government matching the growers' contribution to research on a dollar for dollar basis. I understand that the legislative levy will raise some $160,000 from the growers and the same amount from the Government this year. The triticale industry will now deservedly receive funding under the legislation, similar to that covering the grain, legumes, cotton and sugar industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the comments that the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray, Mr Bruce Lloyd, made in the other place that rural people and industries which participate fully and readily, deserve this type of assistance. This Government stands condemned for its efforts to emasculate the farming industries. Although it deserves brickbats for what it is doing for the rest of the industry, it deserves a bit of praise in this instance because the legislation is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said though that although the triticale industry is a relatively small industry, it does have the capacity to contribute significantly to the Australian domestic market. With further research and the establishment of a stable hybrid, it could also become quite valuable as an export product. We should not forget that the rural industry is worth $22 billion to this country and that its exports are worth $15 billion. In fact, it is not a case of riding on the sheep's back-the whole of this country rides on the back of primary products. The efficiency and the competitiveness of our primary industries are vital to Australia's future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for that comment. The voice of the rural industries in this place is sometimes not heard. It is nice to hear from the honourable senator who always does his bit for Western Australia despite the fact that the Government is not always happy to do something for our export industries. Because of what has happened in the area of scientific research in our country during the last few years, and particularly during 1988, we must be aware that there are, and will continue to be, serious consequences for the rural industries. I have already mentioned the cuts that have been made in respect of the CSIRO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Rural Industries Research Amendment Bill 1988, which is also being addressed today, amends the principal Act by seeking to include Commonwealth seeding funding for the triticale industry under current funding arrangements for Australian rural research. I have read some of the speeches that were made in the other place. I note the honourable member for Wannon, Mr Hawker, made some quite strong comments about what the Hawke Government has done to the rural people of Australia since it came to power. There has been a $37m cut in the superphosphate bounty subsidy; a $50m cut in road funding, a $109m cut in a depreciation allowance; and a $124m increase in levies and charges for the farming communities. There has been a 4.5 per cent increase in fuel excise and a $5.4m cut in assistance for isolated children. This is a real kick in the teeth for all the people who live outside the major metropolitan areas of this great country of ours. Approximately $1 billion has been removed from the primary sector since the Labor Government came to power. Primary industry needs support and encouragement; it needs to be encouraged further so that investment and production will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, primary industry is definitely being affected by CSIRO cuts. That premier research organisation is finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the rest of the world in the field of research. In fact, the problems created by the CSIRO cuts have been raised often in this place. Only in August of this year the Government cut another $8.7m off the CSIRO. Research must continue; if it does so with Government assistance. I congratulate the triticale growers on their initiative and their support for attempts to legislate in respect of research funding for this product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to direct most of my remarks in this cognate debate to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1988, the provisions of which represent the first stage of the Government's planned deregulation of the domestic wheat market. As Senator Brownhill has said, this legislation is a result of the recommendations of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport which was presented to the Government earlier this year along with the Industry Assistance Commission report into wheat marketing. The royal commission, of course, found the existing system of grain distribution to be `highly regulated and dominated by a small number of bulk handling, rail, port and marketing authorities' with `inadequate incentives for efficiency'. It found that most grain was channelled along a restricted number of predetermined paths, the cost of moving grain therefore being higher than it would otherwise be, and that prices rarely reflected the actual cost of providing the related service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commission saw a number of ways of bringing about a more efficient and cost-effective method of grain distribution to meet Australia's future needs. It recommended that marketing authorities should undertake to minimise their costs to growers and reflect in returns to each grower the actual charges incurred by that grower for storage, handling and transport services; that competition in storage and handling services be introduced by removing the restriction to only one licensed receiver in each State; and that port services and sea transport charges be disaggregated. The royal commission also recommended that greater competition be encouraged between land transport and rail services through the removal of restrictions precluding the use of road transport and by the `commercialisation' of rail freight services in addition to port authorities, in order to bring about greater competition in the provision of those port services. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is supported by the Opposition parties, the Australian Wheat Board, the Grains Council of Australia and the farming community. The Australian Democrats do not oppose it. The Bill has adopted those recommendations over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. It provides for the Australian Wheat Board to enter into contracts for services relating to the distribution of grain with whomever it chooses, rather than being required to nominate a sole authorised receiver of grain in each State, as is presently the case. This will provide the Australian Wheat Board with the flexibility to employ those agencies which can provide, in its view, the most efficient service at the least cost to growers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Board is required, firstly, to provide growers those disaggregated charges which were recommended for the handling, storage and transport of their grain so that they can make choices as to the grain path which attracts the least cost. Secondly, it is required to minimise its distribution costs and to reflect in its returns to each grower the actual charges. </PARA>
<PARA> While the provisions contained in this legislation will go some of the way towards creating the conditions to bring about greater returns to growers, most of the royal commission's recommendations cover transport, ports and shipping, which fall within the ambit of State responsibility where 80 per cent of the estimated national savings of $10 a tonne will have to be achieved. The royal commission saw this as happening through the lifting of restrictions on road transport, through the removal of State rail monopolies and by addressing the problems of restrictive work practices and industrial disputes that occur, mainly on the waterfront but also in the rail systems, to ensure that the enormous costs flowing back from such practices are reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Those recommendations of the royal commission have met with mixed reaction from the States. Both the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Grain Handling Authority support the recommendations. Bulk handling authorities in other States, particularly in South Australia and Western Australia, after initial reservations have, I think, come to accept that they are actually well placed to continue as major providers of bulk storage and handling services. In most States, with the exception of South Australia, which is, of course, serviced by Australian National, there is understandable concern among rail authorities about the prospect of the removal of their monopoly over the transport of grain, and the Australian Railways Union in particular has voted its strong opposition to transport deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grains Council of Australia and the Australian Road Transport Federation have made various suggestions about transport reforms. The issue of damage of roads as a result of an increase in traffic has been raised. The royal commission, when addressing this matter, recommended that an efficient road user charging system be introduced whereby the costs of road damage are paid for by those road users that create the costs. Local councils have expressed concern with regard to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) envisaged a reallocation between road and rail to make sure that each part of the task is handled by whichever body is best suited to carry it out. It is a fact that the legislation before us does not of itself deregulate grain transport and the political actions which will be necessary to do that will be taken at other levels. Of course, the States and local authorities will have to act and make their voices heard. I put on the record that the Australian Democrats take quite seriously the concerns expressed by local government in this area, especially when we look at the recommendations of the Grains Council, the Australian Road Transport Federation and others. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have questions about the user-pays charging system which was referred to by the royal commission and which is referred to from time to time by the deregulators in this area. If such a system involves fuel excise, local councils will say that they want a higher proportion of the money collected under this user pays system to go into road funding. Legislation which will come before the Senate in the next two weeks actually provides for a 10 per cent reduction in the current charge of 5.59c a litre. This Government is not taking that into account. The Democrats support local governments' views in this matter. The Grains Council, which proposed an increased larger transport capacity, is obviously not taking those issues into account as much as it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commission has been vague. As far as the Democrats are concerned, State railways are the very best way that we can address the problem of road damage and road use. But, of course, they must be efficient. Unfortunately, railway lines are being ripped up all over the country. This has been a bipartisan exercise. As a Victorian, I have watched Liberal governments preside over the ripping up of branch rail systems. This practice, which has been continued under Labor governments, casts doubt on the claims by the royal commission and the Government of savings which they say will make up for losses that will be incurred if deregulation of the domestic market takes place as the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons the Australian Democrats will not be supporting that deregulation is that the costs will far outweigh the benefits in our view. It will be interesting to see whether Senator Brownhill's sentiments and those of the National Party of Australia are carried through in coalition policy which, no doubt, will not be revealed to us until the Western Australian election. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to link my comments on the triticale Bills with some comments I want to make on the Rural Industries Research Amendment Bill that is also part of this package. Senator Brownhill told us some interesting and relevant facts about the development of triticale. This promising product has been developed over several decades as a result of research in the rural area and we all regret that research is being cut back by this Government. This research was paid for out of the public purse. When the Australian Democrats alone attempted to stand up against the introduction of plant variety rights in this place, we said and warned at that time that public sector research funding in this area would be reduced, and it has. I think triticale is proof positive that we have, in the past, been able to undertake research and development and develop new products in the rural area. Triticale is of course, a hybrid, so there was never any need for plant patenting. I simply put on record that our warnings about reductions in research funding are becoming a reality. We also share the views of all of those in the community who regret the reduction in research funding and, in particular, in rural research funding, which is taking place in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a package of Bills which includes the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1988. Of course, as Senator Brownhill has already pointed out, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill should not be confused with the wheat marketing system which may change next year. The name of the Bill is certainly a misnomer. In fact, it has nothing to do whatsoever with wheat marketing. Nonetheless, it is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I object to the Bill being debated in this way in this chamber at this hour of the day. This Bill is the most significant thing that has happened in the handling of grain since 1947. However, legislation concerning an industry which handles Australia's second biggest agricultural product, worth $3 billion this year, is being rushed through in the lunch hour, with each speaker being given a minimal time in which to speak. I think it is a disgrace that the people who are responsible for Government business should allow this to happen. Although we spent an hour this morning discussing Mr Hayden's trip, we are now shoving through at lunch time the most important Bill for 41 years on the handling of grain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how much time was taken this morning. As I say, the biggest change since 1947 has been shoved through in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In effect, this Bill seeks to do away with the need to appoint a sole receiver in each State. For all its shortcomings, the Bill is the result of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. That inquiry dealt with nothing else but wheat handling, storage and transport. A lot of people around this country and in this Parliament would have liked it to have looked at marketing. However, the Government is trying to use the recommendations of the royal commission as an excuse to deregulate the domestic market. As far as I am concerned, a lot of water will flow under the bridge before this proposition sees the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with my Opposition colleagues, I support the Bill. I believe that no person in this place is more qualified than I am in this area, having regard to my hands-on experience in grain handling and storage in the last 30-odd years. I go back to the 1950s when I started my long discourse with Cooperative Bulk Handling Ltd (CBH) of Western Australia. That contact has continued ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, each State has had a sole receiver. Western Australia leads Australia in the bulk handling of grain, commencing in 1926 with the formation of Cooperative Bulk Handling, a cooperative solely made up of growers. South Australia later copied Western Australia and its system is probably as good as ours in Western Australia. Queensland also has a cooperative and Victoria and New South Wales have government instrumentalities. Incidentally, both of these systems leave a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The cooperative idea is a good one. This is what got CBH off the ground in the first place. Of course, being a cooperative, CBH has virtually unlimited money raising powers. A good example of this was the funding by CBH of the Kwinana terminal in the mid-1970s out of the second advance of the previous season. This arrogant attitude by CBH meant that some of the money that was used came from growers who had already sold their farms at the end of the previous season and would never use those facilities again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now time to do away with the sole receiver. The main reasons are: firstly, the total breakdown in New South Wales and the partial breakdown in Victoria, to which Senator Powell alluded some time ago; and, secondly, the need for competition in other States. My experience has shown that cooperatives, although a good way to start a new system, do not reach full efficiency. This is because certain work practices creep in and directors are inward thinking. Using strict receival hours of seven to 12 and one to six during week days and seven to 12 on Saturdays in busy times and eight to 12 and one to six in less busy times, may have been okay when the crop was harvested at a much slower pace in about two to three months. But the crop now comes off in a third of that time and, of course, a bottleneck results. The board of management of CBH in Western Australia has been insensitive to a call for change and it is time that it received a bit of medicine by way of competition. I have been working on this matter since 1982 and this chain of events was probably responsible for my decision to stand for election to this place. </PARA>
<PARA> CBH has been insensitive to change in respect of rail freight. For example, this year in my town a private buyer of feed wheat set up under permit a 5,000-tonne facility which can receive 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The silo can be filled in one week. Of course, other practices remain, such as staffing levels which are far too high in the off-season. Competition will get rid of a lot of those sorts of things. Also a new warehousing wheat system that was introduced this year will cut out a lot of inefficiencies that have crept into the system. These inefficiencies include multiple handling of grain when no incentive exists to deliver to bins on the main line rather than on branch lines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks the deregulation, with the help of the States, of the transport of grain. Of course, the States have to pass complementary legislation to do that. As I was saying, I have been working on transport deregulation for the last five years. Westrail has always used a grain freight as a tax to balance its books. Farmers who do not use their own transport are, by regulation, required to use rail if they are more than 100 kilometres from the ports in Western Australia. In other words, long haulage is geographically regulated to rail. When we finally got the Western Australian Government to deregulate in some trial areas, the price at some sidings dropped overnight from $25 per tonne to $14 per tonne, but there is a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on all day, Mr Acting Deputy President, but my time is limited. Other measures, such as the new standards of vehicle loading along with the introduction of B-doubles-a configuration of trailers that allows a maximum pay load with minimum tare weight-will help in this area. As has already been pointed out, more road funding will be needed if competition is to be improved. Government should be looking towards funding local roads. We all know what this Government has done in the area of road funding in the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just briefly mention the Triticale Levy Bill 1988. For the information of this Senate, triticale has been around since the time of the Egyptians and the Romans. So it has not been developed in the last five, 10 or 20 years, as has been suggested here today. The Triticale Levy Collection Bill 1988 will raise some $165,000 for research which will be matched by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Triticale has a place in the export trade. The amount of this grain grown by farmers has gradually increased over the last five years. I think mention has been made that the value of the crop is $15m to $20m. This worthwhile grain is grown mainly for the feed, although it can be used in the manufacture of certain sorts of breads. I consider that it has a future. This grain, which has a protein content of up to 18 per cent in certain cases, can be grown on poorer soils and as an alternative crop. In closing, I again express my disgust that this important package of Bills is being debated in this fashion and at this time of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1988, but again draws the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Government has not brought this legislation forward in its agenda in sufficient time to allow a proper and adequate debate on what is a very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia we have declining oil reserves combined with a massive fall in the return on investment because of the dramatic fall in oil prices. The Government's policies provide no decent incentives to further exploration. It is clear that the Government does not want a full-scale debate on the issues involved because that would reveal its lack of foresight and the fact that its policies are not generating renewed exploration. The placing of this Bill in the Government's agenda demonstrates the tiredness and ineptitude of this Government and its Ministers and how much out of touch they are with the people of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is desperately concerned about the predictions of the fall in oil production in Australia over the next decade and the consequences for this nation of the need to import oil to replace the oil which we will not be producing by the year 2000. This Government's policies are not doing anything about solving that problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Lewis has said, the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1988 is fairly uncontentious. But the same cannot be said of the crude oil industry's draconian tax regime. Like Senator Lewis, I would have preferred a much longer debate on this very serious question. The crude oil industry is the most heavily taxed industry in Australia. It pays about 69c in the dollar in taxation. In addition to the normal corporate rate of tax of 49 per cent, there is a whole arsenal of secondary taxes, including a government royalty of 10 to 12.5 per cent of wellhead value on established onshore and offshore areas and an excise on crude oil and certain offshore liquid petroleum gas production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's latest exercise in creative taxation has produced the resource rental tax for offshore greenfield areas and cash bonus bidding on so-called highly prospective acreages in Australia. To cap this all off, there is the 20c a litre excise paid by the motorist-the Australian consumer. The so-called windfall tax gains from rising oil prices in the late 1970s, which triggered the introduction of secondary taxes, have well and truly disappeared, but the taxes remain. During the oil shocks of the 1970s the price, for example, of Saudi Arabian light crude was in excess of $US30 a barrel. A couple of weeks ago crude oil was languishing at about $US10 a barrel and it is presently about $US14. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian industry has been hit particularly hard this year. Not only has it suffered the worldwide slump in oil prices, it has been crucified by an appreciating Australian dollar. The net result has been a 34 per cent drop in the price of Australian crude oil in 1988. Yet, despite this price collapse, the Government continues to use the oil industry as a milch cow. </PARA>
<PARA> People on the other side of the chamber, and particularly the Australian Democrats, often make the point that when Opposition senators speak on this subject they are simply acting as lobbyists for the oil companies. Nothing could be further from the truth. When we complain about these gross secondary levels of taxation, we are acting as lobbyists for Australia. What we are confronting is probably the most serious problem this nation will confront from about 1992 onwards-and that is, a looming oil crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> In these high-taxing times of the Hawke Government, soaring taxation has been a fact of life. I suppose there is nothing unusual about that-everyone has copped it. But what makes taxation of the oil industry especially worrying is the fact that we are running out of oil and these punitive secondary taxes on the crude oil industry are just more nails in the coffin of Australia's energy self-sufficiency. In 1985 Australia was about 100 per cent self-sufficient in oil, but existing reserves are now expected to supply only 25 per cent of the demand by the year 2000. What does this mean? It means that if by the year 2000 we are to be 50 per cent self-sufficient, we will need to discover in excess of a billion barrels of oil before the end of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian crude oil industry has calculated that $26 billion, more than $2 billion a year, will have to be spent on oil exploration and 1,400 wildcat wells will have to be drilled if we are to achieve just 50 per cent of oil sufficiency. However, a combination of the drastic fall in the price of oil and those secondary taxes has meant that exploration of this magnitude is simply not happening. It just cannot happen. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is at the table, recently described the outlook for the petroleum exploration industry in 1989 as good, especially in the Timor Sea. I do not disagree with that. But I think we are seeing coming to fruition the plans that were put into place some time ago. One just does not bring an offshore drilling rig in with a month's notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I note, from the Minister's Energy 2000-type presentation, that he admits the fact that we are going to be short of oil. He thinks that what is happening in the Timor Sea and an expansion of the sale of our coal to the Northern Hemisphere countries will enable us to cope with this shortage. He might have to have a second think when the Northern Hemisphere countries start to do something about their concerns about the greenhouse effect from the burning of hydrocarbons. I agree that there is little the Government can do about fluctuating commodity prices. But there is plenty it can do about the industry's taxation burden. The Australian oil industry's tax regime needs an urgent rethink by the Government. Senator Cook in a press release of 24 November, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, I will be keeping a close eye on exploration trends to ensure that we have the best policies in place. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>At present we do. </PARA>
<PARA>We question that statement very seriously because there is no doubt that the present taxation policies are a great disincentive to new exploration in our effort to find more oil. Of course, the position is exacerbated by our current account deficit. According to this morning's press, we currently have a net foreign debt of $93 billion a year. The October figures indicate that that debt is increasing at the rate of $1,685 billion a month, which is in fact $65m a day-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure you will agree that this figure can be more easily understood; the other figures are too big to contemplate. There is no doubt that there is a critical lack of oil. The highest taxing Government in Australia's history must stop killing off our major export and import replacement industries with secondary and excessive taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted the comments of Senator Lewis and Senator Parer. I thank them for those comments, most of which were not directed to the Bill as such. However, they both indicated that they supported the legislation which I suspect we will dispose of shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer raised some matters which perhaps I can very briefly comment on, given that I am the Minister responsible in this Government for energy policy. I might say that, as a Minister, one sometimes feels somewhat frustrated about not having opportunities to more adequately canvass with the Opposition the detail of energy policy in Australia. There is a need for constructive debate because, although we expect to be in government certainly until the end of the century and maybe beyond, eventually it may be possible that the Opposition will take over the treasury bench. If that occurs, it is important that the energy policy be a consistent one for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to comment very briefly that it is true that oil producers in Australia are taxed more heavily than are other industries. For a start, they pay company taxation. However, the ordinary citizens of this country, who in fact own the resource-in this case, oil-under the land or under the sea, are entitled to an income from the exploitation of what is a rare and depleting resource. They are entitled to an income for leasing off the development, and the ability to make a profit out of that development, to producers. That is to say, there is an element of what the economists would call `public good' in the taxation that is imposed on top of normal company taxation so that the community can benefit from the exploitation of a rare and as I have said, depleting resource. That is the first point I make. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make concerns our ability to remain self-sufficient in oil. We are now about 90 per cent self-sufficient. By the end of this century, depending on what we find, we will be between 30 and 50 per cent self-sufficient. That has implications certainly for our ability to sustain our normal standard of living without needing large imports of oil or, importantly, without using alternative transport fuels obtained from the conversion of natural gas, the liquefaction of coal, the development of ethanol and so on. I might say that all of those three possibilities are real and ought not be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> Three things govern the development of oil in Australia. The first is the price per barrel-that is, the incentive for commercial operators to develop their finds and make a profit. That price, as we know, has gone downwards rapidly and is still very low. Although the price has gone up a few notches following the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna, which was completed this week, it is still extraordinarily low. While the price is low, the incentive for commercial operators to try to develop reserves is also low. </PARA>
<PARA> Prospectivity is the second reason why people get into oil development. What is the prospectivity of Australia? The prospectivity of Australia is still reasonably good. Many areas of Australia have not been adequately prospected. Indeed the Timor Sea beckons as a region in this country where prospectivity is high. There are seven off-shore rigs operating in the Timor Sea on oil exploration as we speak. When we conclude, as we will next year, the terms of agreement between the Indonesian Government and the Australian Government on developing the Timor Gap-the disputed territory between Australia and Indonesia-the prospectivity will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area is cost. It is under the question of cost that the taxation debate arises and I have referred to that. If one were economically rational and wanted to make a sensible choice in terms of energy policy, the best thing to do would be to leave our oil in the ground and buy from overseas when the international price of crude oil is very low, as it is now. That would be the most rational thing to do. Then, when the price rises, we would be able to be self-sufficient in terms of the oil we have here now. </PARA>

The report states that a special registrar, reporting to the Justice Minister, would check how foreign funds were being used. Under the special assistance program for South Africans and Namibians, known as SAPSAN, Australia is providing significant development assistance to South Africans who are disadvantaged by apartheid. This amounts to some $7.5m over five years beginning in 1986. The program in South Africa is directed in particular at providing scholarships for tertiary study, teacher upgrading and other educational assistance, as well as trade union training and urban and rural community development. Similar aid is provided by other Western governments, including the British, the Federal Republic of Germany and other European Community countries, the United States of America and Canada. The Government would be most concerned if state controls were now to be used in South Africa to inhibit the flow of Australian aid to disadvantaged South Africans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and it relates to the Government's failure to honour a commitment given to the over 2,600 members of the Australian Federal Police when it established the Australian Federal Police (AFP) charter of objectives in 1985. That charter stated in part that the Australian Federal Police would be the Commonwealth's primary law enforcement agency and that efficient recruitment, training and personnel management systems would be developed to ensure the attainment of those objectives. Is the Minister aware that for the period from 1979 to the present day over 53 per cent of invalidity retirements from the Australian Federal Police involved anxiety and depression as the major cause, compared with the Commonwealth Public Service average of 29 per cent? Is the Minister also aware that the invalidity rate for Australian Federal Police members up to the age of 35 is six times higher than the Public Service average? Does the Minister acknowledge that these figures highlight the extremely low morale and frustration being experienced by members of the Federal Police over this Government's lack of compassion for the stresses which they are being placed under in their daily jobs? Further, can the Minister explain why the Government has failed to implement the findings of the working party investigation into deficiencies in the Australian Federal Police superannuation arrangements, which investigation was instigated by this Government in December 1985 and completed in August 1987? For the benefit of the Minister, I point out that that report came down overwhelmingly in favour of a separate superannuation scheme to meet the specialised needs of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be surprising, in the field of policing, given the particularly dangerous operations in which police might be involved, that a certain level of stress, beyond that which is the norm in the Public Service as a whole, does occur. It seems to me to be just a matter of commonsense that the peculiar pressures to which the police are subjected, not only in the operational sense but, as is well documented, in the way in which members of the community can regard the police, could lead to the sorts of figures to which Senator Calvert points. But I most emphatically deny that this Government has not been conscious of the need to evolve within the Australian Federal Police a set of objectives and a management structure which will enable its members to get the greatest possible satisfaction out of the tasks which they are asked to undertake on behalf of the community. Indeed, it is to that end that many of the functions which the Federal Police formerly held have been stripped away from them so that members can see themselves, outside of the community policing role in the Australian Capital Territory, as forming an investigative agency nationwide, with the resources, training and personnel to give it a real edge as the pre-eminent law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am surprised that Senator Calvert-perhaps because he has been reading the law and justice policy of the Opposition-is not aware of the fact that we have tried to limit the functions of the Australian Federal Police in the national sense to those detective and investigative duties which are so important for the successful combating of organised crime, drug trafficking and major fraud against the Commonwealth. Indeed, it is interesting that the law and justice policy document put out by the Opposition only a couple of weeks ago speaks of the Australian Federal Police being responsible for-this is no doubt Senator Hill and Mr Brown's work-security and protection functions at Parliament House, international airports, some diplomatic and consular missions and specified Commonwealth properties.

He has said that the Australian Federal Police are involved in the guarding of Parliament House, for example, which they are certainly not, and are involved in guarding consular and diplomatic missions, which they are certainly not. So the Opposition has put out a law and justice policy document which bears no relation to the facts as to the tasks undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. I have talked to many members of the Australian Federal Police, in particular over the winter recess, leading up to the annual conference of the Australian Federal Police Association and the dinner I attended at the Manly Police Staff College. My experience is that the Australian Federal Police Association and its members perceive the move of the Federal Police in the direction of becoming the pre-eminent law enforcement agency, by reason of concentrating on investigation and detective work, as the way to go in order to give them greater job satisfaction, which I believe will lead to the sort of good morale which is so important in any force.</PARA></TALK.START>

In case the Minister cannot remember my question, I asked about the failure of the Government to instigate recommendations on the superannuation scheme for the Australian Federal Police. How does the Minister justify the current position where members of the AFP who feel the necessity to retire five years early, at age 55, attract superannuation benefits which are similar to other Commonwealth employees retiring 10 years early-that is, 36 per cent of salaries for 30 years' service?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is well known, the whole question of superannuation benefits available to Commonwealth employees is being comprehensively reviewed under the aegis of my friend and colleague the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. I believe that that review will properly take account of the special factors relating to the Australian Federal Police. About this time last year-in the week or so before Christmas-Senator Walsh agreed to a proposal I put up to enable a special cessation payment to be given to members of the Australian Federal Police which takes account of the fact that they do have to retire earlier than general public servants, who are able to make their superannuation contributions up to the age of 65. As a result of negotiations between Senator Walsh and myself, this special cessation scheme was brought into operation for the AFP just before Christmas last year. But that does not deal with the overall, wider question of superannuation. That is being looked at and I believe that there will be a favourable outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware of the revelations at the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland on Tuesday, 29 November 1988 which indicate that government contracts worth millions of dollars were let to a French construction company, Citra, after the said company had made donations of $250,000 to the Queensland branch of the National Party of Australia? A number of these government contracts could involve Federal funds, for such projects as the upgrading of the Bruce Highway, which was worth $3,045,000 in November 1983; the Western arterial road project, worth $2,376,000 in December 1983; and the Gateway arterial road, worth $2,600,000 in September 1984. Can the Minister investigate in order to ascertain whether Federal funds allocated for public works in Queensland are let on the basis of a proper tendering system and not on the basis of bribery and corruption?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the allegations. Apart from the specific ones to which Senator Schacht referred, I have in front of me a copy of today's Courier-Mail which reports the former National Party trustee, Sir Edward Lyons, telling the inquiry on Tuesday that in 1983 he asked a Citra representative to donate funds to the National Party. The article said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Edward said the company subsequently gave the Nationals $250,000 in cash, before the October 1983 State election.</PARA>
<PARA> In the next month, Citra had received two State Government contracts. One was a $3 million Bruce Highway upgrading and the other was the $2.5 million Bundaberg Hospital job.</PARA>
<PARA>The $2.5m contract in question was let after the Bjelke-Petersen Cabinet had overruled the decision of the Bundaberg Hospital Board to award the contract to the lowest tender. As I said, that was overruled by the Bjelke-Petersen Government and the contract was awarded to Citra.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a prima facie case to support the proposition that these contracts were determined not by commercial merit but by political bribes. Almost certainly the Bruce Highway construction, which was mentioned by Senator Schacht, involved some Commonwealth funds. However, I do not think that there is anything we can do after the event to ensure that Commonwealth taxpayers' funds are not misused by the Queensland National Party machine. I have long been concerned about the one area of Commonwealth Government expenditure for which I have direct ministerial responsibility-that is, the national disaster relief arrangements. There has been clear misuse of those funds in the past by the Queensland State Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The question also obviously embraces funding under the roads program and the hospitals program. I do not think we can do anything to get back the money that has already been spent, but I will certainly speak to the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, and the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, to see whether they have any views on how we can tighten up on maladministration, which clearly has occurred in Queensland over the national disaster relief arrangements. There is also a prima facie case that there has been maladministration in these other areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to put on the record that the highway contract and the Bundaberg hospital contract have the same sort of reek about them as the awarding of a contract to an Italian company to build the middle section of the gas pipeline from Dampier to Perth in 1981 or 1982. There was a prima facie case of that contract having been awarded on corrupt grounds by the O'Connor Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to an executive order signed on 18 November by President Reagan, part 21 of which authorises the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to `recapture' plutonium and enriched uranium from civilian nuclear power plants for use in nuclear weapons. I further note that the main military reactors run by the United States to produce nuclear weapons fuel have been closed down due to grave health and safety risks and that future supplies of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium from those sources are not assured. Does the executive order remove any distinction between the civilian and military uses of nuclear energy in the United States? Would the recapture of Australian-origin nuclear material from civilian plants by the NRC violate the 1981 bilateral safeguards agreement between the United States and Australia? Does the order mean that all Australian uranium exported to the United States now has a dual military-civilian purpose, in violation of the safeguards agreement? Will the Government cancel future uranium shipments to the United States and arrange the return of all Australian-origin nuclear material in the United States in accordance with article 11 of the agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The executive order to which Senator Sanders refers updates earlier executive orders to similar effect dating back to 1954 which call upon United States departments and agencies to develop contingency plans to ensure continuity of government in the event of a national security emergency in the United States. The plans are administrative arrangements, not policy decisions, and could not be put into effect without appropriate enabling legislation from Congress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against that background the answers to Senator Sanders's specific questions are as follows: First, no, the executive order does not remove the distinction between civilian and military uses of nuclear energy in the United States. In answer to the second question relating to the recapture of Australian-origin nuclear material from civilian plants, I point out that all Australian-obligated nuclear material in the United States is subject to the United States-Australia nuclear safeguards agreement under which the United States has accepted binding treaty level obligations to use this material for exclusively peaceful purposes. The Australian Government has every confidence that the United States will continue to honour these obligations. The answer to the third question is no, the order does not mean that all Australian uranium exported to the United States has a dual military-civilian purpose. The conditions set down in the bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement clearly restrict use to peaceful, non-explosive purposes. Fourthly, the Government sees no need to cancel future uranium shipments to the United States nor to arrange the return of Australian-obligated nuclear material from the United States. Finally, the Government is aware that the future shape of the nuclear weapons industry in the United States is currently under consideration by the United States Administration but this does not mean the seizure of civilian nuclear materials for the United States weapons program is either imminent or likely.</PARA>

Will the Minister give a further assurance beyond his reported sympathetic consideration that Mr Binh will be able to migrate to Australia if he applies in the normal way when he returns home?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3300" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Binh arrived in Australia, I think, to attend a cultural function. It is quite clear from the interview with Mr Binh that, before he left Vietnam, he had always intended to apply for refugee status in Australia. He applied for refugee status. It was considered by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee, which unanimously rejected his refugee claims, including, I might add, in the technical sense also supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Having been refused at that level, it is now up to Mr Binh, under his legal obligations, to return to Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this case differs from any other refugee cases in as much as it has had a lot of publicity. This gives us a long term problem in dealing with any of those cases. If someone is not a refugee by definition but, by attacking his homeland country in the media, he automatically becomes a refugee, that has long term implications for visitor programs to this country and our immigration policy. Everybody realises that Australia is a large immigration country. Every realises that, sadly, many people miss out in their applications to come here. If it is seen that, by using refugee status, people can emigrate to Australia and miss the normal immigration criteria, we would be facing a serious situation.</PARA>
<PARA> I will come to some of the honourable senator's specific points in a moment. We can deal with this matter in a number of ways. We can say that we will allow no more visitors from this country, and I am certain that that could also be the reaction at the other end. We treat these refugee cases on an individual basis and not on a class basis. We do not have a class of refugees, such as Tamils, Vietnamese, or Lebanese. This is often confused.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, having refused Mr Binh's application for refugee status, we have had some concerns as to whether he would be persecuted. Having looked at his previous history in Vietnam, where he was not subject to any persecution-and that is quite clear from the evidence-discussions have taken place between Mr Simmington from my Department and officials from the Vietnamese Embassy. Those discussions are continuing on a couple of points. The dialogue is continuing. The indication from the Vietnamese Government is fairly clearly that the gentleman concerned will not be subject to any abuse or maltreatment.</PARA>
<PARA> Probably the one remaining factor that is not clear in my mind yet from the discussions held between officials is whether the Vietnamese Government would put an artificial barrier in the way of Mr Binh's application to come to Australia. The relationships between the Government of Vietnam and Australia on immigration matters are continually improving. We now have an agreement for an orderly departure system, an immigration system, to Australia which is a big breakthrough. It means that many families in Vietnam that want to come to Australia no longer have to make the arduous march to camps or travel on boats, et cetera. We are establishing an orderly migration program for the reunification of relatives. This is not an easy case, but I believe that if it were handled incorrectly we would endanger that orderly departure program, and many more people would be potential sufferers.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me what guarantees I could give. No Minister can give an absolute guarantee. I cannot give an absolute guarantee that if I deport someone back to New York tomorrow that he will survive for the rest of his life without being knifed, mugged or something else. I cannot give absolute guarantees. One is required to use the best judgment available. When determining refugee cases I do not determine them directly; we have an interdepartmental committee, as I think the previous Government did, which very carefully measures the case of any refugee. I point out that the process in Australia takes three months, and sometimes it is quicker. The process in other countries, through the courts, takes longer. For instance, in Canada it takes seven years. The interesting thing is that the success rate in Australia is identical to that of Canada-15 per cent. That at least reassures me that the procedures are not particularly off-key.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this was not an easy case on which to make a judgment. I understand that there is still one point to be clarified in the negotiations. Having given those assurances, I think the Government of Vietnam would be very conscious of its image in this country and of the development of the relations between the two and would not wish to breach them. Senator Chaney asked me whether I would take personal responsibility. Every time a refugee goes home, every time someone is deported, I have to take that responsibility.</PARA>

I note that he made the point in his reply that it is a matter of achieving the best judgment one can make in these admittedly very difficult matters. I also note that the Minister said that the Government had received assurances. I do not think the Minister in his reply dealt with the form of these assurances. I would like him to give the Senate more detail on the nature of the assurances given and the reason for his judgment that the assurances are satisfactory, bearing in mind the reports that an examination of earlier cases involving students from Vietnam has led officials to change their initial view that a return was a matter that could be countenanced. I ask the Minister: What form of assurance or guarantee has he received from the Vietnamese Government, and why does that satisfy him that the position is secure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated to Senator Chaney, the discussions are not complete. There have been two rounds of discussions on this matter, and assurances have been given to our officials by the Vietnamese Embassy on behalf of the Vietnamese Government. Another issue being discussed at the moment is whether an Australian civilian can accompany Mr Binh back to Vietnam for the three or four months we assume he will be there. That also is under discussion. It would not be an Australian official because, I think, the Vietnamese Government would object. Again, I hope in the next couple of days to get a report about how those negotiations are going.</PARA></TALK.START>

In light of this information and the recent protests throughout the country against the visits, are there any plans for further naval salutes or other events which could involve nuclear-armed or powered warships?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have no plans for any more naval salutes at this stage. We might have in 100 years time for the tricentenary. Normal visits by ships are usually arranged at two weeks notice and, to my knowledge, none have been planned. When they are planned, the Australian Government will welcome the ships of our allies to this country. As for the opinion poll, it should be very comforting to Senator Dunn. It probably means she will get 78 per cent of the vote at the next State election rather than 1.3 per cent. I would have thought that would be fairly good news. This Government does not operate, and neither, I think, does any other national government, on the basis of opinion polls. Opinion polls vary according to the questions asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not mean to belittle this particular company. It is not one I have come across before. Senator Dunn has not adduced any evidence as to how wide the poll was or what questions were asked. If I produce a poll tomorrow showing that the majority of Australians support the American alliance, does that mean Senator Dunn will support motions in this chamber supporting that alliance? Of course she will not. There is only one place where these things are tested; they are tested at the ballot box. On the last opportunity people had to speak in her State, at least 90 per cent voted for parties supporting the American alliance and the visits of these ships. The best she could say is that 10 per cent supported her view, a view shared by her colleague Senator McLean. I am not accusing him of having identical views, by the way; I am speaking about the view of opposing visits of ships-nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, or whatever they may be. I am not particularly impressed by those opinion polls. Nevertheless, they may give Senator Dunn some comfort in terms of the next election. But I would not mortgage a house on that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Hamer in his question and the Law Council of Australia have badly misconceived the whole basis of the trials that will take place. There is no need for this Parliament to vest in the common law courts and the judges who will conduct these criminal trials a special power in relation to preventing an abuse of the process of the courts by an inability of the defence to present its case adequately. The honourable senator is quite wrong to speak in terms of trying to force the foreshadowed legislation through the Senate. It has been on the Senate Notice Paper for 12 months, and I am sure it will be dealt with by the end of this session. I believe that an adequate opportunity for debate will be given to it by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs concluded, if the ordinary rules relating to the trials of accused persons in Australia are adhered to we obviously have a much better situation than would be the case under the old legislation which spoke of courts martial.</PARA></TALK.START>

He went on to talk about dishonesty and so on. He claimed:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that instead of writing dodgy prospectuses Senator Baume should get the report out and look at page 21. He will find this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the financial year ended 30 June 1988 SFIT's equity portfolio incurred a negative return of 11.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Did Senator Baume actually read it? Did he open the covers, or just go off half-cocked the way he usually does? The income of the fund, he alleged, had somehow been `doctored'-that is his term-by switching from Australian Valuation Office valuers to commercial valuers and he said that without the boost to income resulting from the higher commercial valuations SFIT's income would have dropped from $918m to $576m. Note 12 of the financial statements refers to some property-not all property-having been valued by commercial valuers. The income statement, however, shows that the difference generated by the change of valuers for certain properties was treated as an abnormal item and not reflected in the return of 13.4 per cent. Senator Baume should go back to writing Patrick Partners prospectuses rather than misinterpreting annual reports from statutory authorities. He used terms such as `crooked', `wasteful', `deceptive' and `dishonest'. Where are all the humbugs on the Opposition benches who complain about the alleged misuse of Parliament to defame people outside the Parliament? Where were they when Senator Baume was talking about crooked, deceptive, dishonest practices in SFIT? Where was Senator Chaney? Was he jumping up to raise a point of order? Not on your life.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume also alleged that management costs had jumped by 60 per cent. He ignored the fact that there was an identified $3m one-off cost for computer equipment. He chose, just as if he was still writing a Patrick Partners prospectus, to ignore the one-off capital items and say that administrative costs had jumped by 60 per cent. In conjunction with the lack of detail he alleged in the report, in conjunction with the comprehensive financial statement, the report details SFIT's approach to portfolio management, including sectoral diversification and the question of trade-offs between risk and return. The performance for the year, including for each sector, the five-year comparative performance and, most importantly, the relationship to the relevant indices, including sectoral weightings within the share portfolio, can be found on page 20. Just as SFIT did not list all its fixed interest holdings, it has not listed all the shareholdings but this information can be provided if required. The information contained in the annual report is presented on a sector and overall portfolio basis rather than the individual stock or assets basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The attack on SFIT with Senator Baume's defamations and misrepresentations of all the people associated with the SFIT board of management, including Mr Dewar, who I thought was regarded as a member of the Melbourne establishment, were accurately reported by the Melbourne Herald in the text but alongside a photograph of Senator Peter Baume. I suggest that Senator Peter Baume should sue the Herald for libel.</PARA>

If so, can the Minister advise the Senate of the suitability of this company's wholly owned subsidiary to operate responsibly in Western Australia's diminishing native forests, given the possibility that its parent company may be forced to cease trading? Finally, can the Minister give an assurance that the financial troubles of McLean's parent company, the TPS Group, along with public disillusionment with government involvement in financially shaky institutions such as Rothwells, will be a consideration in the Minister's decision whether or not to grant an export woodchip licence to McLean Consolidated Pty Ltd?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I should say in answering this question from Senator Vallentine that she should have an opportunity to withdraw the introductory paragraph to her question because it is factually wrong. I know that Senator Vallentine likes to argue from the point of view of what is the case. What she has asserted is so factually wrong, so untrue, as to render her ridiculous. What this Government has done is preserve a quarter of a million hectares of the very tallest trees in Australia in the Southern Forests and the Lemonthyme-trees that have been described as the tallest flowering plants in the world. It has done so in a way in which they will be protected by World Heritage. The area that Senator Vallentine seems to think might contain trees is obviously, from her introductory paragraph, the hole in the doughnut area, which contains small spherical scrub. She is just so factually wrong in the introduction to the question that she is ridiculous and should have the opportunity to withdraw the allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the question of the McLean licence application and the TPS Group. I have not actually read the reports, but if it is true that the TPS Group and McLeans are suffering financial difficulty-Senator Vallentine asserts that, and I have no question with the accuracy of the assertion she has made although I do not personally have knowledge of the situation-that is a great pity. I do not profess to know all about TPS's operations, but I do know this: it is trying to develop an investment package to expand private plantations of Australian hardwoods in an area near Albany in Western Australia; that is, it is trying to develop a forest resource which will meet the needs of woodchippers from private plantations, thus in the longer term obviating the need for woodchippers to have access to a native forest resource. I would have thought that all of us in the chamber, including the Independents, would applaud any business enterprise that was trying to expand the forest resource base by planting on hitherto undeveloped land in order to meet the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia exports about $400m of forest products a year but imports $1.9 billion of forest products a year. So we cut forests in other countries to the value of $1.9 billion. Some of those countries protect their environment as we do, but many of them do not. I would like to see industries like TPS encouraged rather than denigrated so that we can protect the environment not just in Australia but globally. I think that is an important consideration in terms of forest industry development for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine asked me whether I would take these facts into account when considering the McLean application for the issuance of a woodchip licence. I have now received final documentation from the Western Australian Government commenting on the McLean application, and the applications by Whittakers Ltd and WA Chip and Pulp Co. Pty Ltd for woodchip export licences. I will be dealing with those applications in the next few weeks. I hope to expedite the matter. In regard to making a decision, the McLean application is based almost exclusively on exporting woodchips derived from sawmill residue; that is, in the process of milling and dealing with timber a residue pile is created and it is woodchips out of that pile, as I understand it, that McLean wishes to export. If it does not export woodchips out of that pile, the pile is burnt; it is destroyed. That ought to be considered when referring to the application by McLean for a licence.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not yet made a determination on, nor have I applied my mind to, the issue of McLean in particular. But a fortnight ago in Perth I spent all of one morning with eight environment and conservation groups from the south-west of Western Australia, going through with them in considerable detail all the implications of a woodchip export licence. For the record, there was no obligation on me to do this, but I believe that, in dealing with the issuance of licences concerning a matter as sensitive as this, there ought to be open disclosure by the Government and a genuine attempt to deal with the objections that are put forward by bona fide groups. I took a whole morning out to do that. If Senator Vallentine wants to check with those groups she will find that a proper, full and adequate consultation took place. When I come to make a decision about the issuance of the licence to McLean I will take all relevant factors into account. Some of those factors may be related to the question asked of me today and some of those factors may be related to the objections, but they will also be related to the information provided to me by the Western Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have to get some details on the specific questions of fact Senator Jenkins has asked me about. However, I recall that a pilot plant was built by Western Mining near Kalgoorlie. I cannot vouch for the year it was built but I think that the honourable senator is about right; it was in the late 1970s. The purpose of the pilot plant was to prove up the technology to treat uranium ore to the level of yellowcake in anticipation that the Yeelirrie uranium prospect that Western Mining held north of Kalgoorlie would go ahead. We know that the Yeelirrie uranium prospect has not gone ahead. I do not know whether the plant has ceased production, but I anticipate that it has, as it ran through the pilot operation a certain amount of tonnage which it announced in advance it would do to perfect the technology, and it exported out of Western Australia, as I recall, some samples to possible clients for a future production run if the Yeelirrie mine went ahead. I am a bit hazy about this, but my recollection is that it exported that to a West German company. I will get the honourable senator specific details on those precise points later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked as well whether it was approved by the Western Australian Government, or was the Western Australian Government notified about the shipments. I do not have any direct information on whether the Western Australian Government was notified about them. The State Government of the day was the Charles Court Government, and the Federal Government of the day was the Malcolm Fraser Government. I have not checked the records to see whether either of those governments knew, and I am not in a position now to say whether they did. I suppose obviously the Federal Government must have approved the issue of a licence to export yellowcake samples. As the State governments control internal transport, the Western Australian Government must have approved the arrangements for transport to the port for dispatch by shipping. As I said, I will supplement this answer with the particular detail when I am able to check with my Department what that detail is.</PARA>

One of the noteworthy things about it-although this is not a surprise-is that it has not clarified, in any way whatsoever, whether the Opposition is committed to any of the extensive list of expenditure promises, implicit and explicit, which the Treasurer and I released today. The statements it has made are vague and sloppy-implicit and explicit-and the reason the Treasurer and I held that press conference was to draw the attention of the public to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney will find out in about April. We do not have $2 billion worth of expenditure increases hanging around; nor do we have any promises to abolish $3 billion worth of revenue without doing anything about tax rates or tax thresholds. The Opposition has made $3 billion worth of explicit promises to get rid of revenue, without saying a word about tax rates or tax thresholds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that, early this afternoon, Mr Oakes and a number of other journalists sought some clarification from Mr Howard about what the Opposition is really committed to and what it is not committed to, and he got no enlightenment either. The really remarkable point-no, this is not surprising, but it is pretty cheeky-is that Dr Hewson is challenging the Treasurer to a debate. We all know that Dr Hewson believes he should be the shadow Treasurer; we all know he believes he should be the Treasurer, if not Prime Minister; but the plain fact is that he is not the shadow Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA> I do recognise, mere meritricious player though he is, that he does have better intellectual equipment to be shadow Treasurer than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who in fact is the shadow Treasurer. If Dr Hewson wants a debate on this question, I will be very happy to have it with him. Ever since Senator Stone was sacked, I have felt rather deprived not to have the odd joust with the shadow Finance spokesman. I warn Dr Hewson that, if he takes up my challenge to have a debate, I will be hammering him on these points, among others: is the Opposition committed to spending another $500m a year on road construction; or will it continue the present Government's policy of maintaining it in real terms; or will it adopt Senator Stone's policy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November, Senator Watson asked me a question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. I am now in a position to give an answer to Senator Watson. Thioridazine tablets, of which Melleril is a brand name, are available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in four strengths-10 milligrams, 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams and 100 milligrams. The three weaker strengths had their listed maximum quantity doubled on 1 August due to a Government policy decision. However, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) did consider the proposal before implementation. While it agreed that there should be no safety implications with the lower three strengths, it did advise that the 100 milligrams strength should not be included; hence, the 100 milligrams strength remains at that strength.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to concerns which have since been expressed, at its most recent meeting the PBAC reviewed the situation and has recommended that the listing of tranquillisers, including thioridazine, should revert to their prior to 1 August availability. This recommendation will be implemented in the next available reprint of the schedule on 1 April-maybe that is an appropriate date-1989.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) accused me of having libelled the members of the Board of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust by making false claims about the dishonest nature of that annual report. He said that my comments were wrong; that I was false; and that he had produced what he claimed to be evidence to refute what I had said. And he imputed, it seemed to me, motives to my criticism of the Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts are totally to the contrary. In each instance, on every issue that the Minister raised, he was totally wrong. The facts, as I stated them, are absolutely correct. He totally misrepresented me by claiming falsely that I was being untrue in saying that the report sought to hide the facts. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is only by a close, detailed examination of the accounts printed at the back of the annual report that the extent of the disastrous year for the Trust is revealed, because the printed report does not do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister, in then seeking to claim that I was misleading this chamber, quoted from the detailed printed accounts at the back of the report. That is exactly the point that I had sought to make. He also claimed that my comment about administrative expenses having risen was somehow dishonest, because I had failed to mention the acquisition of some computer equipment. Note 10 in the accounts, which deals with administrative expenses, does not mention such computer purchases and, in any event, in normal circumstances they would be a capital item and not an administrative expense. The thrust and the detail of the Minister's attack on me and on my personal integrity during his response were totally false. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am one of the few that it does stop. I do nothing more than draw the chamber's attention to the proposal of the Remuneration Tribunal. Enough has been said about it already, but I note-I am not conscious of the Government's response-that the present rate of annual salary of the Parliamentary Librarian is slightly in excess of $10,000 above that of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and the Secretary to the Joint House Department, who are on the same salary. If I remember correctly, they are level 2 officers and the Parliamentary Librarian is a level 4 officer. Under the Tribunal's proposal, the Secretary to the Joint House shall receive a responsibility loading of $10,112 per annum, which would take his salary almost precisely to that of the Parliamentary Librarian. This means, for reasons beyond my capacity to interpret, that the Principal Parliamentary Reporter will be left languishing in the structure of the three departmental heads, some two grades below that of the Parliamentary Librarian and Secretary to the Joint House Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view the responsibilities of the Secretary to the Joint House Department are no greater than those of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter. I would have thought that their grades ought to be identical and that their salaries ought to reflect that. Because I do not have a copy of the report, I am unable to make further observations about that, except to say that I have no reason to believe that the Secretary to the Joint House Department has assumed new responsibilities that attract a promotion by two grades and a salary at that level. I hope that the Government, which daily seeks to impose its will upon the functioning of this Parliament, will look with some care at the levels of the three departmental heads. It seems to me unreasonable that the level of Principal Parliamentary Reporter should be lagging considerably behind those of the Parliamentary Librarian and, most of all, the Secretary to the Joint House Department. Of course, my comments in no way reflect upon their personal competence or capacity. Naturally, I am referring to the positions themselves. </PARA>

I join my colleague in saying that it is unfortunate that reports of this significance are not available to us to enable us to debate them properly. One of the concerns I have about the Joint House Department relates to the enormous expense this Department is going to face as a result of the unsatisfactory completion of work by the Parliament House Construction Authority and the unsatisfactory condition of many of the major items in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly do not wear ties; the honourable senator is quite right. I am concerned that the Joint House Department is going to face a massive volume of unexpected expenditure as a result of failures that it has inherited from the Parliament House Construction Authority. I refer not only to the Great Hall and the corridors, but also to the equipment in the dining rooms and elsewhere, about which I understand a report is being prepared for the Presiding Officers by the people in charge. I understand that that will involve considerable expenditure which, of course, will involve additional estimates, which we will have to deal with in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about the floor and the response we got this morning. This morning we were told that there has been no decision about resanding, resurfacing and refacing the floors, which is in conflict with the evidence we were given on 20 October 1988 at Estimates Committee E, where Mr Fowler said:</PARA>
<PARA>The floor in the Great Hall, for example, is planned-and has been for some time-to have a sanding and be resealed over the Christmas recess. That is something that has been planned for at least a year, perhaps 18 months. So there is planned maintenance that you would expect on the flooring. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked about the level of pitting on the floor. One of the officers said:</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking personally, I am not surprised by it, but I think, as we have pointed out before, it is more evident in a building of this nature. That is because, firstly, of its special character where people are actually looking for these sorts of things and also because of the extent of the parquetry. We can only repeat that the best design practices were used and the best construction practices as well, and the result is what would normally be expected in all buildings, but I think we are just noticing it more in this building. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to be a grossly unsatisfactory answer. I wonder whether Joint House has any plans about this. Obviously, the plan that we were advised of, to sand and resurface the floors over the Christmas break, has now gone by the board. What is Joint House going to do about the matter? Who is going to pay the bill?</PARA>

I ask the Minister how many he would have had had he not shown the restraint that enabled him to have 27 art works on average in his room. Did the Minister show any personal restraint at all?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that most of Senator Aulich's ministerial colleagues have such appalling taste that probably very few of us would want some of the art works that they have chosen. But maybe they got some advisers to tell them what would be appropriate for their suites. I accept the honourable senator's interjection. It is most appropriate. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the memorandum from the Clerk of the Senate dealing with this question demonstrates how totally misleading the Parliament House Construction Authority was in explaining to the Senate Estimates Committee how this allocation happened to take place. I will quote, if I may, from Mr Harry Evans's letter to Senator Childs. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At page 5 of the Authority's answers, it is stated that I advised that the Authority control led the distribution of artworks to Ministers, office holders and Members and Senators, and that the Authority considers this advice to be misleading. I do not consider that my answer was misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, that, as the Authority indicates on the same page of the answers, the Presiding Officers have determined a scheme for the distribution of the remaining-</PARA>
<PARA>that word `remaining' is underlined-</PARA>
<PARA>artworks based on a seniority list of all Senators and Members, but this scheme was provided to the Authority only after the Authority had already distributed art-works to Ministers. The distribution of artworks to backbench Senators and Members in accordance with the scheme has not yet commenced. The fact remains that it is the Authority which has control of the distribution of artworks. Indeed, the statement by the Authority that ``the distribution of artworks from the rotational collection therefore has been and is still being done strictly in accordance with the priority listing done by the Presiding Officers''. . . is quite misleading, because, as I have indicated, artworks were distributed by the Authority to Ministers before the Presiding Officers determined the scheme for distribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that we have the facts let us start again. The Joint House Department has the authority to look after this collection. I believe this Senate should require Joint House to undertake this task immediately. It should give the members of this place a fair go and demonstrate to Ministers that they do not have the right to ride roughshod over this place. Nor have they or the Construction Authority the right to mislead this chamber as they did in terms of this letter from the Clerk about the manner in which this rip-off took place. I hope that at an appropriate time an appropriate motion may be moved to that effect. </PARA>

In fact I could lend him a Leunig cartoon that I have in my office, neatly framed, which is all about two boys kicking a football. I thought that that would be very symbolic of this place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have risen in this debate in order that we can get back to first principles in relation to the way this place is run, and the way we go about designing, constructing and running major buildings in the Government's construction program. Senator Michael Baume has been most unfair and less than valuable in the comments he has made about the Joint House Department. It ought to come back to us in this place. All of us should remember that the very important early work done in designing and constructing this building, and approval of that work, was the responsibility of the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House which was formed in 1978. We had our representatives on that Committee. Our representatives on that Committee are largely responsible for what we have here today. The Joint House Department has been given the responsibility for making it work. It was not there making the decisions about the design of this place back in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I am prejudiced in that sense because I probably would never have built this place if it had been in my area of responsibility. The New South Wales Parliament had the right approach to a new or updated and more relevant Parliament House. At the same time, I am not going to come into this chamber and listen to people like Senator Michael Baume nitpicking on the outskirts about the problems that we have in the running of this place and blaming the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to get back to first principles and use those first principles in an advisory manner and wisely when we get on to other construction programs that we as parliamentarians may be involved with. On average 10 per cent of the expenditure for any major construction project goes into the design and briefing stage; that is, the client spends time with the architect and the other people responsible for the ultimate design and the client clearly enunciates his or her brief. If that brief needs to be changed as a result of discussion during the briefing stage, it should be changed then because if mistakes are built into the design in those very early stages, many of those mistakes will never be overcome, even by the most efficient organisation that is ultimately given the opportunity or the responsibility to run a place such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators are concerned about distances, parquet floors, the fact that the drivers have no mess room to wait in and have to wait in their cars as they did at the old Parliament House, and the fact that recreation areas in this building are isolated and hardly used by senators at all-and I am concerned about those problems-it is wrong and immoral to blame the Joint House Department because it was we, as parliamentarians, who in 1978 elected our representatives to sit on the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House in order to right that design. If we were not satisfied with the prototype design put to use by architects of the day, then it was clearly our responsibility to say so and use the powers of enforcement, advice and decision-making that were given to our Committee. For Senator Michael Baume to come in here and in an unctuous way bag, on the outskirts, a department which has a responsibility to make this place run, and try to patch up the problems, is totally wrong. This is not the first time that Senator Baume has done this in relation to government construction projects. </PARA>

The situation is that the Joint House Committee is part of a whole process that is necessary to run this place. There is legislation coming before the Senate to make this place run more efficiently-there will be fewer departments and a rearrangement of responsibilities. This is an attempt to make a brand new, enlarged parliament work in the way that it should work. I hope that when that legislation comes before us we will look at it as if we were managers or clients. The sort of nitpicking that has gone on about the running of this place by the Joint House Department falls by the wayside because the responsibility comes back to us. We elect our representatives and we have the opportunity to rearrange the structures for the operation of this Parliament. The challenge is up to us. To stand back and nitpick is a waste of time.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America from 5 to 21 January 1988. In tabling the report of this delegation I want to draw the attention of the Senate to several matters. This delegation represented the real value which can be derived from parliamentary delegations making official visits overseas. This value is reflected not only in having a particular message heard in the areas of the United States visited, but also in the knowledge and experience gained by individual members of the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This delegation had three major objectives: to reiterate the difficulties Australia faces in the trade area; to raise the awareness of Australia's technological capacity and of trade and investment opportunities in Australia; and to explore the thinking of senior United States officials, business leaders and experts in the public and private sector on a number of important issues to Australia's future, including economic development, regional concerns and strategic matters. The successful achievement of these goals, as illustrated in the delegation's report, was brought about by the harmony within the delegation and the united voice the delegation presented on many vital issues. Many political and business leaders remarked on this feature of meetings with the delegation especially when it was realised that all three major parties were represented.</PARA>
<PARA> The delegation had a full round of meetings and briefings with senior Reagan Administration officials and congressional leaders in Washington. The delegation also visited San Francisco, Houston, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Atlanta and New York. The delegation found this to be a very valuable way to approach a country as large as the United States, not only because it demonstrated the great diversity of the country but also because local business and political leaders went out of their way to assist a delegation from a country which does not very often send official visitors to regions outside the Los Angeles, New York, Washington triangle. Congressional representatives were also able to spend a good deal more time with the delegation in their local areas than would have been the case in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate and briefly mention the delegation's major recommendations: First, Australia through its representatives in Washington must not relent in repeating its trade message to congressional and administration leaders. Secondly, consideration should be given to engaging a specialist lobby firm to work on Australia's behalf in addition to the valuable work already being done by our permanent officials in Washington. Thirdly, in recognition of the dramatic economic growth in the southern region of the United States, centred on Atlanta and Georgia, a review of Australia's trade and consular representation in the southern region of the United States should be carried out with a view to achieving a greater official Australian representation in the area. The establishment of a consulate-general or an Austrade office in Atlanta should be explored as a means to achieve this. Fourthly, Australian delegations and visitors from both the public and private sectors should visit more places outside the Los Angeles, New York, Washington tri- angle. The interest in Australia especially in investment and trade opportunities is great in these areas and this potential should be explored wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I pay a particular tribute to all members of the delegation and especially to the deputy leader, Senator Chris Puplick. The delegation operated as a well tuned team and this made my responsibilities as leader so much easier to carry out. The visit to the United States demonstrated to me and to many others the real value which can accrue to this Parliament and to Australia when official parliamentary delegations travel overseas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement and paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will start my very brief remarks on behalf of the other members of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America by recording our thanks to you, Mr President. You acted as the leader of the parliamentary delegation and we all enjoyed not only the relaxed manner in which you led the delegation, but also the considerable hospitality that you extended on a number of occasions throughout our trip in the United States. I am told by your colleagues in the Australian Labor Party that you are a practised traveller on delegations and it is quite obvious that the skills you have acquired over many years of participating in and leading parliamentary delegations made the delegation's work a great deal easier. In recent times I have read that some parliamentary delegations have not travelled quite as happily as our delegation did. I believe the fact that ours did travel happily in very large measure bestows great credit on you, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA> I should indicate that the other members of the delegation were Mr Brumby, Senator Childs, Mr Blunt, Mr Rocher and Senator Maguire. On their behalf I extend our thanks to you, Mr President, as delegation leader, also to Mr Walsh, your senior private secretary, who was with us briefly, and Mr Diamond, the secretary of the delegation, who certainly performed a very admirable role in support of our work and was of great assistance to all delegation members. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I want only to draw attention to the fact, by way of emphasising the points which you made in your speech and the recommendations which are contained in the delegation's report, that it is very important in the United States that representatives from the differing parties speak with one voice to the United States, particularly about its trade protection policies. Although this is a slow and difficult process, I believe that there is an enormous value in the repetition by parliamentarians from Australia to their congressional counterparts of the very considerable concerns that Australia has about the trade policies of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the opportunity to talk to the Secretary of Agriculture and to others about a variety of matters, including the sugar industry, the wheat industry, the export enhancement program and a number of other irritants in Australia's bilateral relations with the United States. Indeed, I think we put into perspective the argument in Australia about the use of the American bases in this country as potential levers for bringing about change in United States agricultural policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation is that the Government give consideration to the appointment of a specialist lobbyist firm to work in Washington on behalf of Australia. This is a recommendation which I support very strongly. Mr President, you will recall that in the course of discussions in Washington we met with a friend of mine by the name of Simon Pinniger, an Australian who works in the United States as a lobbyist in the agricultural sector. It is unfortunate that he works mainly for our competitors. He works for a number of countries in Africa and a number of countries in the Middle East, both buyers and sellers of agricultural products in the United States. They know that, despite the efforts of their embassies and legations in Washington, diplomats and people posted in Washington tend to come and go on a fairly short term basis, whereas lobbyists who are permanently based there are able to build up relationships with senior congressional figures which they cultivate over 10, 15 or 20 years and more. Under the seniority system in the United States Congress, people become chairmen of important committees or subcommittees largely as a result of their length of service rather than anything else. Many of the people who head the most important congressional committees, as far as Australian trade is concerned, are people who have been in the Congress for many years and have a great deal of seniority. It is only those lobbyists who have developed a working relationship with them over a prolonged period who are able to have any degree of influence, which is very hard for people who are based in Washington for perhaps two or three years to cultivate in their relatively short stay. </PARA>
<PARA> A year or so before this delegation I had the opportunity of travelling in the United States with a delegation which included some members of Parliament, including Senator Schacht, who is in the chamber at the moment. He will recall that, in discussions we had in the United States, this point about the need to cultivate relationships over a prolonged period with senior people in Congress was made to us in the course of our stay. I believe that the recommendation of this delegation that consideration be given to engaging specialist lobbyist firms in the United States is important. It will not just be in the agricultural area. I cite, for example, the developments that will take place in the Australian aerospace industry. It will be necessary to have people in the United States who will be able to deal with appropriate congressional committees as far as that is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The third recommendation is that an Australian presence be established in Georgia. That was certainly impressed upon us by representatives in that part of the United States. We had the pleasure of meeting Governor Harris, the Governor of Georgia, and Mayor Andrew Young, the Mayor of Atlanta, both of whom made the point that Australia is a major investor in the economy in Georgia and that the development of Australian commerce in southern States, from Georgia right the way through to southern California and New Mexico and Texas, is of some importance. Mr President, it was certainly true that people in Houston and Atlanta were very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to members of Australia's parliamentary delegation because, as you rightly said, there is a tendency for delegations to confine themselves to visiting Los Angeles, San Francisco occasionally, New York and Washington and they believe that, under those circumstances, they actually have some appreciation of what happens in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the time that we spent in those southern States was important. The discussions we had in the port of New Orleans with the port authorities and the world trade authorities similarly gave us a new perspective on some trade and transportation issues which are of importance. I certainly endorse the comments made in the delegation's report about a greater Australian presence in States such as Georgia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also of some interest to note that we travelled through the state of Louisiana. When Senator Robert Ray mentioned Louisiana earlier today it drew to my recollection that wonderful series of stories about politicians in that part of the world. I had the pleasure of taking photographs of Senator Maguire standing in the State House at Baton Rouge with his finger in the bullet hole where the bullet eventually lodged after Governor Huey Long was disposed of. A comment was made, which perhaps Senator Ray had in mind, about the American politician who said that, when he died, he wanted to be buried in southern Louisiana so that he could remain active in politics. The whole ambience of politics in the southern part of the United States is considerably different from that in the eastern States or on the west coast and it is important for us to appreciate that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond very briefly to the comment Senator Schacht makes. For those who do not know, the delegation of which Senator Schacht and I were members met Governor Evan Mecham, Governor of the State of Arizona, the first Governor actually to be impeached and removed from office in 60 years. We were in Arizona the week after Governor Mecham was formally inaugurated. The recall petition was already circulating and had a large number of signatures on it within his first week in office. He was subsequently brought before an inquiry conducted by the Arizona State Assembly, somewhat akin to the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. Governor Mecham was a used car salesman and some of his electoral practices were found to be sufficiently fraudulent actually to remove him from office. We can probably claim to be a very unique group of Australian parliamentarians to have met this person who will figure in the history books for perhaps somewhat less than the most starring reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final recommendation is that delegations move away from simply visiting the national capitals in places such as the United States. Mr President, as you rightly pointed out, the United States has been described as a country in which there are nine separate nations. An understanding of those nations and their regional differences within the United States is extremely important. I believe that the parliamentary delegation which you led had a considerable capacity to get a better understanding of a number of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> This report contains the texts of a number of speeches delivered by Mr President in the United States. Those speeches to chambers of commerce and to meetings with the Society for International Affairs in New York are certainly worth reading because I think they are very important contributions on the way in which the Australian Parliament can put the view of the Australian people in a quite united fashion to groups as important as chambers of commerce and international societies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two final points that I wish to make. Members of the delegation were also encouraged and given the opportunity to undertake separate visits in the course of the delegation. For example, at the end of the delegation Senator Maguire visited Kansas City and I think was quite impressed by the fact that he was the first parliamentarian to make a visit, as part of an official delegation, to Kansas City and to Missouri. The importance which was attached to his visit by representatives was very much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity in the course of the delegation to visit a number of centres in the United States involved in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) crisis. It is perhaps relevant on World AIDS Day that I mention that. The most striking thing, I think, was when, on the first day we were in the United States, I visited a hospice in the City of San Francisco, and I met the people running that hospice, both the religious organisation and the medical staff. I also met eight or nine of the patients who were there. It was striking because they were all people younger than I and they were in that hospice in order to die. It struck me at the time that it was quite clear that by the time I had returned to Australia at the end of the visit, some three of four weeks later, all those people would be dead. They went to the hospice purely for the purpose of dying. The hospice takes only those people who are in the last two or three weeks of their life. When one meets a group of people who are, as I said, all younger than oneself and one knows that, by the time one is safely back home in one's own bed and own country, all of them will be dead, it starts to make a further considerable impact on one's understanding of the AIDS problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I also visited a number of hospitals and the Department of Health in San Francisco. The delegation as a whole spent some time at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, talking with the researchers and people doing the primary work. I spent some time in Washington with the Congressional Committee which is in charge of the AIDS program and AIDS funding in the United States. I visited the institution in New York, called the Gay Men's Health Crisis Centre, which performs the same sort of role and function as the Albion Street clinic in Sydney. I visited the shanti project in San Francisco and a number of others. I have appended at the back of the report a very brief statement about the separate visit I made in terms of looking at those AIDS facilities and have made a number of comments about the management of the disease in Australia and in the United States in a comparative sense. Perhaps it is appropriate, as I said, on World AIDS Day to draw attention to that and to my belief that, if we get the right decisions made in Australia, there is no inevitability that we will go down the same road of tragedy as the United States has in its public health response to the AIDS crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise to colleagues for taking this amount of time to discuss this report. Nevertheless, it is an important report. I think the reports of parliamentary delegations should be formally noted in the Parliament. The way in which this delegation was led is, I believe, also a tribute to Mr President and to the officers of the Senate Department and his own staff who facilitated the arrangements for the delegation. Rather than seek leave to continue my remarks, I simply advise honourable senators that I believe this report is one which repays some study and thought. I hope the Government will find itself in a position to act upon the recommendations in due course. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This examination of the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) efficiency audit report is the ninth special report of the Committee. Whilst it is not a detailed review of the AGPS, it affords the Committee the opportunity to report to the Parliament on progress at the AGPS since the Committee's 1978 report on that organisation. In inquiries such as the one that the Publications Committee has just undertaken, committees always run the risk of running off at a tangent and picking up very unusual and interesting bits of information which are not necessarily the target of the report or the brief of the Committee. However, our Committee did stick to its brief, and I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would, however, mention two very interesting aspects which came out of the report but which were not necessarily the detail of the charge laid on the Committee in the examination it was directed to undertake on behalf of the Parliament. One interesting observation was that when we advertised for submissions-and we advertised widely in all national and State newspapers on 18 and 19 December last year-we also sought written submissions from all government and parliamentary departments, 39 major statutory authorities who were exempt from using the AGPS printing and publishing facilities, and nine non-Commonwealth exempt bodies, together with all unions whose members were employed at the AGPS. We sought to get as widespread an interest in the inquiry as possible. It is interesting to note on this point that the only submissions we received were those from departments and statutory authorities to which we wrote ourselves; so the accusation could be made that the advertising we undertook, at a cost to the Commonwealth and the taxpayer of Australia, was actually non-productive. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to mention briefly which came to light during the public hearings of the Committee was the propensity among government departments and other bodies to develop sophisticated in-house tabletop printing facilities. That in itself was not an issue that this Committee was charged with reporting on. But one interesting observation I have to make in regard to this is that when inquiries were made to these bodies who were using quite sophisticated equipment, with fairly substantial budgets in some cases, absolutely none of them employed an apprentice in the printing trade. There seems to be a view developing within departments that they do not need to train people. It is something that the Government has to be concerned about; the industry itself has to be concerned about it. Of course, the unions which have members in the industry have great interest in this sector of the industry, and should take note of and watch this development carefully in the future. In the interests of time, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard the remainder of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Standing orders of both Houses, one of the roles of the Joint Committee on Publications is to inquire into the printing, publication and distribution of parliamentary and government publications. Since its commencement in 1970, the Joint Committee has presented eight `special' inquiry reports to the Parliament. This report is about improving:</PARA>
<PARA> the Government Printing Office;</PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Government Publishing Service; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealth printing and publishing system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> After careful consideration of all the evidence before it, the Committee believes that there should be some relaxation of the current system requiring Commonwealth departments and non-exempt bodies to be tied clients of the AGPS.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> that Departments and non-exempt bodies not be tied to the AGPS for non-core `general printing' and `publications' work up to a value of $20,000;</PARA>
<PARA> that they should continue to be required to seek and consider price quotations from the AGPS for all work;</PARA>
<PARA> that all AGPS core work-that is parliamentary work and urgent and confidential Government tasks-be charged for on a full cost recovery basis; and</PARA>
<PARA> that AGPS charge for non-core work at competitive commercially equivalent rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report recognises that current Government administrative initiatives have been directed at devolving management responsibilities to departments and allowing managers more freedom to judge where, and how, to place resources to achieve optimum returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Departments should be able to exercise such freedom when undertaking their printing and publishing programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with current moves to place the AGPS on a more commercial footing, the Committee believes it is vital for the AGPS to be treated as a self-contained management unit employing appropriate management accounting systems. </PARA>
<PARA> All activities of the AGPS should be accounted for and charged out to appropriate departments and other bodies. The AGPS should have its own internal audit unit. It should promptly complete development of its computer based management systems and external financial statements. It should also regularly report to the Parliament on its operations, performance and outlook.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that significant reforms have occurred at the AGPS during the last few years. While these may be applauded, many were overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> If the AGPS is to continue to be viable in the long term, it must continue to accept the need for reform and regular review of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The AGPS should not be a static organisation. It must be pro-active. It must be responsive and adaptive to needs and varying levels of demand. It should expand or contract its operations within the terms of the Commonwealth Charter of Printing and Publishing Responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the relationship of the AGPS with the Parliament. As honourable senators may recall, the origin of the AGPS stems from the work of this Committee and its predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the priority status and special position of the Parliament should continue to be recognised by the AGPS. It should also be fully reflected in the Commonwealth Charter of Printing and Publishing Responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> As the AGPS implements a policy of full cost recovery for parliamentary work it may be necessary to increase appropriations for parliamentary printing and publishing as-</PARA>
<PARA> cost recovery rates will recoup all costs incurred with parliamentary work plus costs not recovered from non-core work charged out at commercial rates, and</PARA>
<PARA> AGPS should no longer receive any deficit funding. </PARA>
<PARA> To minimise the impact of this increase in parliamentary printing and publishing costs, the Committee has recommended that parliamentary computing systems and in-house printing capabilities be developed to meet the needs of users in this building for:</PARA>
<PARA> Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives,</PARA>
<PARA> Journals of the Senate, and</PARA>
<PARA> the Notice Papers of each House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that, for these parliamentary publications, the AGPS continue to meet the needs of users outside this building by using the camera-ready copy supplied by the Chamber departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that major savings and efficiency improvements will also be gained if computer systems for the electronic transfer of Hansard to the Government Printing Office are developed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The AGPS has had the equipment to receive and process electronic data since 1984. Although considerable action has already taken place on this issue, it will be necessary to fully introduce systems for the electronic transfer of Hansard as soon as possible if costs are to be contained and reduced. This is particularly the case as the AGPS moves towards full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> To maintain the links between the Parliament and the AGPS, the Committee has decided to meet regularly with the Government Printer and senior officers of the AGPS during each of the Budget and autumn sittings. The Committee will report to the Parliament on the outcome of these meetings, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the members of the committee for their co-operation during this inquiry and their on-going diligence to the work of the committee. The expanded parliamentary committee system creates many additional commitments and the time and effort that members were able to provide is appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank the Committee's Secretary, Peter Mason, for his support and the long hours he has put into the reference, especially as his committee work-load is in addition to his duties in the House of Representatives Bills and Papers Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the ninth special report of the Joint Committee on Publications entitled Review of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit report on the AGPS. I received this report only in the last couple of hours, so I have not had time to look at it in detail. However, I took particular note of a recommendation on page (xiv) which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Joint Committee on Publications regularly meet with the Government Printer and senior officers of the AGPS during each of the Budget and autumn periods of sittings of the Parliament to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To that recommendation I say a loud amen. I say that because, since I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and as that Committee has moved around Australia in its inquiries on active citizenship, I have become more and more aware of the lack of understanding and knowledge of the Australian public of the parliamentary process. That lack of knowledge of the proceedings and of the legislation covered by Bills, statutory rules, explanatory memorandums, ordinances and regulations puts our democracy at risk. If that information is not easily available to the public our democracy is also placed at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 various publishers were permitted to obtain a licence to publish those materials-Commonwealth Acts, statutory rules, Bills, explanatory memoranda and regulations and ordinances-and make them available to the public: to people interested in the parliamentary process, law students, academics and general members of the public who wish to inform themselves about what goes on here and about the governing of our country. It was with great concern that I read a letter which I received yesterday and which I believe was addressed to all senators and members of the House of Representatives on a matter which should concern all of us and which requires an explanation. The letter was sent under the name of three major law publishers. They indicate that a review is being undertaken by the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) with the intention of removing the blanket licence that has been available on application to publishers to produce those documents to which I referred earlier. There are some documents-quasi-legislation such as Australian Taxation Office rulings-which are outside the blanket licence. The publisher expressed concern that the licence which has been in place since 1985 is apparently being reviewed by the AGPS. </PARA>
<PARA> In the letter the publishers say that on 18 July 1988 law publishers wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Stewart West, asking to be consulted about the review. They say that on 27 August the AGPS replied asking for a huge amount of information in less than a month but supplying no details of the review's terms of reference or its composition. On 7 September the Minister replied without giving any details and the law publishers again asked for basic information. On 21 November the Minister replied supplying the names of the officials conducting the review and confirming that there were no terms of reference and also informing the law publishers that submissions closed on 28 November. The law publishers claim that the letter was received by them on Thursday, 24 November, therefore allowing only one full working day to provide submissions. The publishers collecting the information originally asked for a meeting with the review committee. Their claim is that the Minister's office refused the request. </PARA>
<PARA> I view with concern this allegation-I am saying only that it is an allegation-that the law publishers have made on the manner in which this review has been conducted. If it has been conducted by the AGPS, I view with concern the haste, the lack of information and any attempts that are being made to reduce the free availability of information. I also would view with concern any attempt to reduce competition that AGPS may have to face by the law publishers if they are able to produce this material at a more reason- able cost. I call on the Minister responsible to give the Senate an explanation as to the goals of this review and an assurance that publishers will still be able to publish material such as Bills, Commonwealth Acts, statutory rules, explanatory memoranda and ordinances and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already expressed, in the Estimates committee hearings, my concern at the pricing and publishing policy of the AGPS. Its method of cross-subsidisation means that some papers which are vital for the public to have access to are priced prohibitively for individuals. The library conference held recently in Canberra indicated that the costs are almost prohibitive even for libraries to stock these materials. It is vital that these sorts of papers are available to the public. As I said, given the concerns that have been raised in the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into active citizenship, it is vital that there be no hindrance to or blocking of the availability to the public of information of this nature. I see this as a very serious issue. I ask that the Government address the allegations and claims that have been made, and I expect that the Senate will be duly informed. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>These reports give an indication of the range of the work of the Committee and some of the difficulties it faces in achieving its targets. Report 294 covers five efficiency audits of the Auditor-General presented to the Parliament in the period June 1986 to June 1987. These audits cover a diverse range of subjects such as Army mapping, stock control, customs agents, meat inspection and offshore petroleum royalties and excise. With the exception of some outstanding matters mentioned in the report the Committee is satisfied that departments and agencies have responded positively to the Auditor-General's findings. </PARA>
<PARA> Report 293 is the annual report of the Public Accounts Committee and will give honourable senators an indication of the wide range of subjects covered by the Committee. Time precludes a comprehensive discussion of the report but I am pleased to highlight a major initiative which demonstrates the present Committee's commitment to improving the system of parliamentary scrutiny as a whole and not simply dealing with issues on a case by case basis; namely, the Committee's inquiry into the reform of the Australian Audit Office. The Committee is of the view that it should always be looking towards proposals and initiatives for significant reform in public administration which will improve the system of public accountability of Commonwealth departments and agencies. In this respect the Australian Audit Office performs a crucial role and the Committee believes that, in terms of its possible long term ramifications, this inquiry is one of the most important yet undertaken by the Committee. The Committee is also committed to reforming its own procedures to ensure that it operates in a more efficient and targeted manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to report 292, which deals with the Committee sitting during sittings of the Senate. Unfortunately, the Committee must advise the Parliament that some disagreement between the Committee and the Senate continues. The Committee remains committed to the thrust of its view, previously expressed in report 264, that the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 should prevail over conflicting Standing Orders which purport to restrict the Committee from sitting during sittings of the Senate. To comply with the full terms of the Senate's request would prevent the Committee properly undertaking its heavy task of scrutiny alluded to in my remarks on report 293. However, the Committee is conscious of concerns of senators and for its part will endeavour to ensure its own program does not put its Senate members in a position where they will not be readily available to participate in Senate proceedings as required. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I take this opportunity as Deputy Chairman of the Committee to commend by colleagues and the secretariat staff for their days and months of dedicated service on the major inquiries currently being conducted by the Committee. I commend the reports to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the delegation planned this overseas trip it intended to visit Japan. Regrettably, because of the illness of the Emperor Hirohito of Japan that part of the trip was postponed. However, this enabled the delegation to spend more time in the Philippines and South Korea, which was of great benefit to the members of the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation spent approximately nine days in each place. I would like to touch on my observations. In the Philippines we covered almost the whole country, from Manila to Subic Bay, to Cebu, to Davao to Mindanao and to northern Samar, where there was a major Australian aid project in the form of the construction of a road. The project commenced in 1978, was delayed in 1983 and then recommenced and we saw it in the process of being completed. I appreciate the fact that no-one likes instant experts. We do not like them in this country and I am sure that no-one in any other country likes them but I think that some observations would not be amiss. It was certainly my view, and I think it was the view of the whole delegation, that the Philippines finds itself in a most difficult position after 20 years of decline under Marcos. There seems to be an unrealistic expectation in the country that Mrs Aquino, the new President, could fix in two years what was destroyed in 20 years under the previous leader. </PARA>
<PARA> From our point of view, the major problems that confront the country are poverty and insurgency. People leave the provinces for places like Manila and then squat on government property. Those who have seen the recent television program on the Philippines will know of the place called Smoky Mountain where some 10,000 people live in congested and unhygenic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major problem in the country is insurgency, although the situation seems to have changed in recent times for the better. It is difficult for those of us who live in a country like Australia, where we do not have guerilla attacks and 15 people a day being killed on the streets, to appreciate the difficulties that occur in countries like the Philippines. I suppose that it is easy for people who have strong human rights views to decry what happens in a country like the Philippines, without recognising the country's problems. It was explained to us in, I think, Davau by the people behind the so-called Alsa Massa-which is really Neighbourhood Watch with a difference-that they had 15 killings a day until they introduced certain anti-insurgency measures. The killings had been reduced to one a day. We in this country have difficulty coming to grips with such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The next phase of the trip was our visit to the Republic of Korea. I had the benefit of having been to Korea a number of times. My first visit to Korea was in 1974. There was one hotel there and a 9 o'clock curfew. I have been back a few times since then. Prior to this trip my last visit was in 1984. There is no doubt that the Republic of Korea is one of the economic miracles of the world. In just over a decade Korea has achieved the status of being the third largest steel producer in the world and the third largest producer of microchips. We visited the new steelworks at Kwangyang Bay, which was built with the country's own technology, and which produces the same amount of steel as does Australia, with something like 5,000 employees. Korea has the latest state of the art technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that is obvious to anyone who follows the movements of the Republic of Korea is that its net foreign debt of about $30 billion is reducing at the rate of $US1 billion a month. So Korea is going in the opposite direction to us in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The trip was most intensive. There was little time for rest. The great benefit from these trips is what we learn from them. It has been my opinion for some time now that we can learn from the growth we have seen initially in Japan, followed by Taiwan, now Korea and, I believe, subsequently Thailand and lift the standard of living of our own country to those levels. It is interesting to reflect that it was not so many years ago that those countries were copying from the Western countries. We are now looking at them to find out how they have got it right, and we are copying from them. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that one or two of my colleagues want to speak to this report, so I will wind up. I pay tribute to the leader of the delegation, Dr Klugman. We had an interesting combination of people on the delegation. We had three members of the Senate and three members of the House of Representatives. We had Dr Klugman, Mr McArthur and Mr Millar from the House of Representatives Senator Beahan, Senator Burns and me, from the Senate. We had three Labor members, two Liberal members and one National Party member. Within the Labor group we had representatives from each of the three major factions. Notwithstanding that, and in the view of recent remarks by members of other delegations about the conduct of their delegations, the delegation acted in a unified fashion throughout the trip, there was harmony throughout the trip and we always ate at the same table. As deputy leader of the delegation, I pay tribute to Dr Klugman and to the other members of the delegation. On behalf of the delegation I thank Mrs Lyn Simons, the Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Representatives, who accompanied the delegation and did such a fine job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I indicate my appreciation of the capacity and the preparedness of the two ambassadors in South Korea and the Philippines to provide us with a lot of information, which demonstrated their expertise. All members of the embassy staffs were efficient people. One thing became clear very quickly. They had the capacity to make a connection with the people in different parts of society in those countries and to understand what they felt and what they were saying. It is one thing to have a connection with a government and nothing else; it is another thing to understand what different sections of the community think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was most impressed by the way in which our aid projects were being carried out, particularly the project we saw in Samar and the way that the money which is being spent there by the Australian Government to assist the Filipino people is being properly applied. One application was through the use of non-government organisations, which involved the people in developing projects in certain areas so that they had an association with the projects. It was not a question of people throwing money at them and their sitting down and waiting for more to come. It was quite poignant to hear them put to the delegation the plea that we should not leave the area but should continue to give its people assistance. That is not possible, however, and the Government would be well advised to give help to people in other areas. In the Philippines there has been a distinct lack of results in terms of economic advancement and the reallocation of land to peasants. </PARA>
<PARA> During the revolution one read about the unity between Laurel, the Vice-President, and Aquino, the President, and the united action to remove Marcos. The great pity is that that unity has gone; people are now starting to look at their personal position, and there is division. As a result, the people in the Philippines suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite unnerving to talk to some of the police in the Philippines, with the six-shooters at the hip and magazines of ammunition around their belts, even though they are surrounded by hundred of other people with submachine guns. It is sad when a trade union organisation like the KMU, which represents sugar workers, can have its vice-president shot publicly, and no progress is made in finding the culprit. It was indicated to us-this appears in the report-that the Communist Party's New People's Army is suspected. I would be very sceptical about that being the case. I believe we should continue to assist the Filipino people. The report describes our efforts in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Korea is concerned, there is no doubt-I agree with Senator Parer-that it has made tremendous strides in terms of economic progress and providing better living standards for the people. One thing it sadly lacks is democracy. It is also good to see that in that regard it is moving forward. Certain demands are being made by the people. There is a minority government. Those people who were once in prison are now leading political parties and are able to put their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention the discussion that is taking place about the reunification of North and South Korea. It seems to me that that is not a possibility. The first thing that is needed-and it would be needed before any second step could be taken-is some freedom of movement across the demilitarised zone. That does not seem possible, but until it is I believe that any talk of reunification is empty talk. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I thank the Australian people for the opportunity of representing them overseas. All visits like this, during which exchanges of points of view can be readily carried out, are to the advantage of this country as well as those which we visit. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In light of the recent controversy concerning reports of other delegations, to which Senator Parer referred, I feel it important to say that this was a very harmonious, constructive and positive delegation, and I endorse the remarks made by the President in presenting his report earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the success of this delegation, as well as thanking others, to whom I will refer later, I think specific mention should be made of its leadership. I refer, in particular, to the honourable member for Hughes, Mr Robert Tickner, and also to the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith. They both played an excellent role. They worked well together and they made it much easier for the other members of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some controversy about the question of accompanying spouses. Two members of the delegation were accompanied by spouses. That in no way militated against the successful conduct of the business of the delegation. In fact, they enhanced our capacity to communicate with our hosts and saved us from some difficult circumstances in social situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit was very positive for individual members of parliament. Not only that, it gave us the opportunity to raise in a semi-official way issues on behalf of Australia that are very important. I hope and believe it increased the standard of understanding and perception of Australia in those countries. In particular, in tabling the report-which essentially speaks for itself and I do not wish to reiterate what it says-I must say that we had to deal with some very sensitive human rights matters. That is why I appreciated the harmonious, bipartisan attitude of the delegation. The issues were politically sensitive in the countries in which we found ourselves, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, and in Australia. It was therefore very important that the matter be handled with discretion, and that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to express my concern about the human rights situation in Singapore and Malaysia, as is referred to in the report, and to add a personal note about my concern, which I have raised in Malaysia, in Australia before we left, and again now, about the detention of Opposition members of parliament, representatives of the Democratic Action Party of Malaysia. I refer in particular to a parliamentary colleague and a person whom I met in Australia many years ago, even before I was National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, when I was Secretary in Western Australia. Mr P. Patto, the Organising Secretary of the Democratic Action Party, is interned. I refer also to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lim Kit Siang, who is under detention for a second time. While I appreciate the circumstances in Malaysia, I think it is inappropriate that these people should remain in detention. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point about the delegation's visit to both countries was that it maintained its sense of perspective while raising forthrightly the sensitive human rights issues. It was also able to conduct positive dialogue with representatives from the public and private sectors, parliamentarians and others, in both countries, about important economic and trade relations and about things we can learn in science and technology. It made some very important contacts for subsequent enhancement of relations between our countries. I have been gratified in the brief period since we have returned to have had an exchange visit from the Director of the Science Park in Singapore who, during a visit to Canberra, came to see me and continued discussions which we had commenced during the visit to Singapore. I hope in that way I was able to help him in the visit and contribute to the evolution of policy in his country, as he was able to help us. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue that Senator Burns referred to with regard to the Philippines-Australian aid-remains a very important part of our relationship with Papua New Guinea. We also saw the broader nature of the mutual interests of our countries. I want to reinforce the recommendation of the delegation that Papua New Guinea, as such a close and important neighbour culturally, strategically and economically, should take a higher profile in the activities of the Parliament, in its relationship with other countries. We make a number of very worthwhile visits to many countries. It is all too rare that parliamentarians visit this country which is our nearest neighbour. I think we all found our understanding, as parliamentarians interested in the affairs of that country, was all too minimal and it is important that that understanding be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to thank the hosts in the various countries, and the Australian High Commission staff. I endorse the remarks made by Senator Burns. High Commission staffs in these countries gave us outstanding assistance. They are outstanding representatives of our country. I thank my fellow delegates and Allan Kelly, the secretary to the delegation. I thank the Parliament and the people of Australia for the opportunity of representing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I reiterate and support the remarks of Senator McMullan about the report of this delegation to Singapore, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. It was the first occasion that I have represented Australia as a member of a parliamentary delegation, and I was very proud to do so. I did not know what to expect, but as was said by Senator McMullan and, I think, Senator Parer and Senator Burns, delegations are certainly not junkets. They are an opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to meet politicians from other countries. I, too, say that I was more than a little concerned about the human rights issues in Malaysia and Singapore. I particularly remember that when we were in Malaysia at a meeting with the Bar Council I was astonished to find the members all wearing pins on their lapels with the words `Justice for Judges'. I do not think many places in the world would have judges wearing badges such as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some very positive aspects came to light as a result of the visit from our parliamentary delegation. Before I go any further I would also thank Allan Kelly for the wonderful way in which he looked after us, even though I did take a little time over a haircut one day which caused some concern to our leader. But we were a very harmonious group. It gave me the opportunity not only to understand the ways of politicians in other countries, but also to learn a little about politicians in our own country, and I was very gratified for that. The staff of the high commissions everywhere we visited, as Senator McMullan has said, were most helpful and their comprehensive briefings were more than adequate for the tasks that faced us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to highlight a few of what I thought were the positive aspects of the trip. I was very impressed by the professional approach to industry and commerce shown by the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority. I have passed on some of its ideas to my State Government in the hope that it may take note of them. While I am on that subject, as a delegation we noted that in Sabah-in fact, in all of Malaysia-there existed quite a good market for students to come to Australia to study. I am pleased to say that both Warwick Smith, MP, and I approached our State Government on returning to Tasmania-I am not taking credit for all of this-and that a small delegation, or working group of educationalists, has gone to Malaysia this week to follow up some of the contacts that we made and some earlier contacts made by the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that came to light while we were in Sabah was an incident regarding the export of some feral goats from northern Australia to Kota Kinabalu. I was most upset to see the condition of those goats. Some 80 out of 400 died. I am a member of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, and I am sure that my colleagues on that Committee would also be very disappointed at the way in which these animals were treated and the condition they arrived at in Malaysia. I have followed that matter up and I am pleased to say that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has assured me that the chance of that happening again is most unlikely. I hope that is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the highlight of our tour was the time we spent in Papua New Guinea. I must say that for me, on my first trip outside the country, it was somewhat of a culture shock. Anybody travelling to Papua New Guinea who has an opportunity to visit the Goroka show will see thousands of years of history in one particular area at one particular time. I would like to compliment publicly the work of our small detachment of engineers in Mendi in the Southern Highlands Province. They have not only helped the local people in all sorts of ways, but also they are providing a very positive Australian presence in an area that is still very much in the Stone Age in some ways. I was very pleased to have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) recently, in this place, saying that Australia is hoping to place another unit of engineers in Papua New Guinea. It is a very positive way of Australia keeping its presence felt in this neighbouring country of ours which, believe it or not, is only five kilometres away from Australia. I reiterate what Senator McMullan said: the fact is that Papua New Guinea is so close to Australia, yet we were the first parliamentary delegation to visit that country in five years. That is something we should remember because, whilst our Foreign Ministers and officials from the Foreign Affairs departments may drop in to each other's country quite often, I think the contact between politicians at a more grass roots level is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very impressed by the aid we are giving to the Papua New Guinea Police Force. I suppose the much publicised problem in Papua New Guinea at the moment is law and order and having to cope with the `rascals'. Some of the recommendations in our report, particularly about assisting the Papua New Guinea Government with unemployment schemes and the like, are a positive way in which our delegation may help solve that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I had some personal interest in was the perceived problem of hydatids. This matter was raised with us in Mendi in the Southern Highlands. The Papua New Guinea Government, in its wisdom, is trying to encourage the use of sheep rather than pigs in the native villages-and I think it is a great idea. It seems that the local authorities are concerned that the habits of the people, along with the dogs and everything else that goes with them, could bring about the onset of hydatids. Being a Tasmanian, I know the problems hydatids can cause, because Tasmania did have the highest incidence of hydatids in the world, apart from Yugoslavia. After 24 years we now have the cleanest situation concerning hydatids in the world. The health authorities in the Southern Highlands were aware of this. Since I have returned, I have contacted our local agricultural department and have sent some material to the Papua New Guinea authorities. I am pleased to say that Senator Cook has taken the matter up, and I hope an Australian International Development Assistance Bureau project will help Papua New Guinea resolve this problem down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government takes notice of our recommendation to continue the aid to the villagers in controlling rust in coffee, that will have a very significant effect on the local industry in Papua New Guinea, because the village system as the villagers know it in the Highlands relies wholly and solely on coffee, and anything that damaged that industry would be a major disaster in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As other honourable senators have said, these delegations do drag on and we work very hard. But I will always remember the final function we had on the last evening in Kieta in the North Solomons Province, where the huge Bougainville copper mine is located and we were very impressed by that. We were given a farewell function by the Province and I will always remember the floor show, which was accompanied by a bamboo band. If honourable senators want to know what a bamboo band is, their instruments consist of different lengths of bamboo taped together with various lengths of insulating tape and are pounded on one end with a rubber thong. I assure honourable senators that it is a rather unusual noise, and just for Senator McMullan, I will remind him what it sounds like. It sounds like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a question in line with Senator Durack's question. With regard to the employment of the Commonwealth police in these inquiries-according to evidence that has been produced, they have been announcing themselves as Commonwealth police and asking questions-in what part of the charter of the Commonwealth police are these activities undertaken? There is no crime involved, at least no current crime-there may be a future crime. What exactly are the police doing questioning people when there is no alleged offence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Greenwood and the Special Investigations Unit have sought to second officers from the Australian Federal Police-I think three-and some New South Wales police have been attached to the Special Investigations Unit at Mr Greenwood's request because of the obvious skills which they have in conducting investigations. The sorts of inquiries they are carrying out are an extension, if you like, of the sorts of inquiries that Mr Menzies undertook. As acknowledged by all sides in this Parliament, when the report of the Menzies Review of Alleged Entry of Criminals into Australia was tabled he required this further series of steps in order to further particularise the matters which he brought to the attention of the Executive and then to the Parliament by way of report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sorts of investigations being undertaken could be undertaken, I suppose, by various persons and under various auspices. In Canada it was the Deschenes Royal Commission. I know that in England similar sorts of inquiries are being undertaken by a former distinguished Director of Public Pros- ecutions. In this nation the inquiry is being undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit and police officers are attached to help in the further investigation of matters which Mr Menzies alerted us to. </PARA>

I can accept, though I do not approve of it, that the Special Investigations Unit can carry out investigations on available material suggesting there may be war criminals in Australia. It is not the same thing as Commonwealth police officers-they are the ones we are particularly concerned with in this Parliament-announcing themselves quite properly as Commonwealth police officers and questioning people when there is no alleged offence. I ask the Minister-I am sure that he would agree there is no alleged offence; there may be one in the future but there is not one at the moment-by what right and under what part of their charter are police officers questioning people when there is no alleged offence?</PARA></TALK.START>

Amongst members of the team that has been assembled to discharge this very onerous duty, and one on which the whole of Australia is, of course, concentrating its attention in order to ensure that it is conducted fairly, are these Federal Police officers with their special skills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that information. That clears the air. However, I must say that, whilst I understand the question of the confidentiality of names, I find it quite extraordinary that the Government is not prepared to make public the number of interrogations that have been undertaken and are being undertaken. This matter is, in my view and I think in the view of a growing number of Australians, potentially the most divisive issue that has been brought into this Parliament by any government in a long time. It is mandatory on the Government at this very difficult and sensitive time to be honest and open with the electorate as to just what is going on with the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). I think Senator Durack mentioned this in his brief remarks before the lunch adjournment. I was appalled that not one member of the Special Investigations Unit appeared before the Estimates Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Estimates committees work by the Minister taking prime responsibility for answering questions. I think I did so in relation to the Special Investigations Unit. As evidenced by my other role on the Estimates Committee-namely, that of representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand)-senators would be well aware that I bent over backwards to provide any witnesses who were required by any Estimates committee. I went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that in relation to Aboriginal Affairs, and had there been any suggestion by any senator that he or she wanted a particular person from the Attorney- General's portfolio to be brought to the Estimates Committee, I would have attempted to undertake that. As it was, no such request was made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not personally criticising the Minister for his conduct of the Estimates hearings. That was not my intention at all and I am surprised that the Minister is unduly sensitive about these matters. Because he is obviously not going to answer the question, I make the point that, of all the agencies and government departments that come before Estimates committees, I do not know of any one agency other than the Special Investigations Unit that did not appear before an Estimates committee. It is an extraordinarily unusual circumstance and as a result, despite the Minister's best endeavours, many of the questions that were asked were unable to be properly answered in front of the Committee. They had to be either swept under the carpet or taken on notice. That, quite frankly, is not the way this Government should go about conducting itself in Estimates committees if it is serious about providing information to this Parliament. As the Minister well knows, many questions had to be put on notice. Representatives from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Minister himself were present but they simply did not know the answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise a couple of matters relating to this aspect that I still find very confusing, particularly the question of the relationship to date between the Special Investigations Unit and the DPP. The Minister will recall the discussion recorded on page E220 of the Hansard record of Estimates Committee E on 21 October 1988. In answer to some questions by Senator Hill, the Acting Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Delaney, said that the DPP had looked at aspects of cases but had not looked at any case completely. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been aspects of investigations put to us for the purpose of determining what effect the scenarios described in those aspects might have on future prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not find that clear in any way. Does that mean that details of some of the investigations that have been made into specific cases have been passed on to the DPP? I would like to have confirmation of the actual situation in that respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall this matter coming up. Just before I answer the specific questions, and perhaps being more sensitive than I ought to be, I wish to indicate that the reason Mr Greenwood was not present, when he has been present at Senate committees in the past and is very willing and able to appear at Senator committees, was that he was overseas. Members of the Attorney-General's Department who are given the task of working in this particular area were present at the Estimates Committee, as were members of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who, in the first round, did not have enough particular knowledge of this matter. When Mr Delaney came before us, we finally got to the point where he answered Senator Hill's question. Page E220 of the Hansard record reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;. . . what sorts of aspects are you looking at? Give a few examples.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We are looking at the form of the indictment, questions of duplicity, questions of delay, questions of proof of whether a territory is occupied, how you prove that there was a state of racial discrimination, the historical proofs on those sorts of matters. If there is, for example, genocide, we look at how you would describe that in an indictment. We are looking at those sorts of matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill then said:</PARA>
<PARA>When you are looking at questions of when a State is occupied, are you looking at specific States and specific circumstances?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I will not get any further with that line of questioning at this time but I hope the Minister will look at that question because I do not believe that it is clear. I do not feel confident that the Minister knows the answer to that question. It is of such importance that I hope he would at least take it on notice today and come back into this place with a more specific answer at a later date. Because of time restraints and for other reasons I will not pursue that matter further at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly, I want to make mention of a couple of other aspects relating to the work of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and the investigations that it is undertaking. I was very surprised indeed that the SIU was not able to tell us how long it would take to complete its investigations. At the Estimates Committee hearings in April it gave an estimation, from memory, of a year or so. At the last Estimates Committee hearings it was not able to give us any indication of time. I believe that that is a very serious matter. Again, for the reasons we went into in the earlier part of the discussion today, it is imperative that the investigations of the SIU be carried out with the utmost care. It is now known, although the Minister is not prepared to tell us how many people are involved, that investigations and interrogations of people are taking place in this country. Written responses from the SIU since the Estimates Committee hearings have also told us that witnesses are being interviewed in the Soviet Union, including the Baltic states and in countries such as Yugoslavia and Hungary. Therefore, I believe that this whole area is a powder keg. If the Government does not handle it more sensitively and frankly than it has been doing to date, it will cause very great concerns and problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been various irregularities in relation to the travel of officers of the SIU. To date the costs have been quite phenomenal. The fact that the SIU is unable, at this stage, to put a date on the conclusion of its investigations presumably means that the cost is open-ended at this time. We do not know how many people are involved. The Menzies inquiry less than two years ago came up with a figure of 70 suggested names. We were told in the Estimates Committee that the number of names exceeds 500-I think it is 525-although the file has been closed on 110 of those. But that still leaves more than 400 names that were admitted at the Estimates Committee hearing. I understand from remarks that have been made since that time that there could be even more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> We were provided with what I believe is extraordinary information at the Estimates Committee hearing in terms of the sources of these names. As I understand it, 164 names were provided to Australia by the Soviet Union without any supporting material; I think that is what was indicated at the Estimates Committee. Quite frankly, that is a scandalous situation that the Government must explain in greater detail than it has done to date. I know that I speak for a large number of people both within this Parliament and outside the Parliament when I say to the Minister that there is an enormous amount of concern in the community about how this matter is being handled. The very fact that it has come up at all is a separate issue. But, in my view, the way the Government is handling it at the moment is designed-I presume not deliberately but it will have this effect-to make what is a very difficult and sensitive issue that much more difficult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short said that various irregularities had occurred in the expenditure of the Special Investigations Unit. I cannot recall any such irregularities being pointed out at the Estimates Committee or in the Committee's report to this chamber. If he believes that such irregularities have occurred I would wish to be informed so that the responsible Minister, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), can take proper action. But I think it is an unfortunate assertion to make, in the absence of any evidence that I am aware of, that irregularities have occurred in relation to the expenditure of the Special Investigations Unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the list received from the Soviet Union, unfortunately, the Special Investigations Unit is not in a position to predetermine what it will receive from various sources. It was presented with a list of 164 names which, as I understand it, did not have any supporting material apart from an indication of the presence of persons in Australia. Obviously the Director, who was in receipt of that list, has formally requested the Soviet Union for details of the allegations. That has not been forthcoming so far and I believe that the status of the list would be well judged by that very fact. </PARA>

<PARA> There are significant delays in getting cases heard before the Magistrates Court at present. I wish to refer to some of the times involved. Urgent matters in the criminal jurisdiction, I am told, take three to four months. If a person is in custody it may take four months; if not, it will take eight to nine months. Traffic offences take eight months, civil cases take five to six months, small claims take two to three months, family matters take two to three months, and the children's court-wait for it-takes two months if a matter is urgent and if it is not urgent it takes about three months. Workers compensation takes up to eight months. One can imagine the disruption to the life of a family waiting that long. Domestic violence, if it is urgent, takes a week. If it is not urgent it takes three to four weeks. I would have thought that any domestic violence matter was in the urgent category. Inquests take five to six weeks. Of course an inquest occurs only when there is extreme trauma and upset for a family. I certainly have had people contact me about the distress of having to wait for long for the outcome of an inquest. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these delays and the work of the court, there ought to be an increase in funds to enable the court to carry out its functions properly. Not only is there not an increase but there is a decrease on the funds available last year. I wish to refer to the figures. The administrative expenses of the ACT Magistrates Court in 1987-88 were $628,000, yet this year the estimated expenses are put at $249,000, which is a reduction of $379,000. In amongst all the details of the Estimates is what is described as a one-off payment for the Forensic Medical Centre totalling $440,000. It was admitted at the Estimates Committee hearing that this was an erroneous figure and that, in fact, it was more like $267,000, which is a difference of $173,000. I ask the Minister: Where is the $173,000 and why has it not been restored?</PARA>
<PARA> The question remains as to whether the $267,000 is truly a one-off figure. It comprises $80,000 for each of 1985-86 and 1986-87-that is, a total of $160,000-in respect of forensic fees paid to the Health Commission of the ACT by the court. Apparently that was a negotiated figure which the two government agencies agreed was a reasonable cost at that time. The remainder, $107,000, which is the cost of toxicology tests for the year 1987-88, was arrived at on a fee for service basis. It was not just negotiated as had been the case in the two previous years. In other words, for 1987-88 the cost of forensic work for the Magistrates Court was $107,000, and there will be continuing forensic costs for this year. In fact, they are likely to be the same, if not higher, than they were last year. These costs will not disappear; it is not, as was stated at the time of the Estimates Committee hearing, a one-off expense. The court will require an allocation for this year's forensic fees, but it seems to me from reading the figures that none has been made. I hope the Minister will be able to explain it. I was surprised at comments made by the Department at the Estimates Committee hearing. One officer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Figures on workload are somewhat ambiguous. They suggest . . . a falling off in the criminal and civil work of the Court in the last 10 years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, Minister, I would be very surprised if this were so. Of course no evidence was given to substantiate that comment. In terms of the court's ability to do the work which it is required to do I wish to refer to a problem the Office of ACT Administration has had in collecting parking fines. Honourable senators might think that that is not a particularly significant matter-it certainly is not the most important work the Magistrates Court is responsible for-but there is over $1m outstanding in parking fines because the court has not been able to cope with the volume of work. The Government has not changed the structure of parking fines so that they can be dealt with in some other way, and parking fine collection is still a matter to be dealt with by the Magistrates Court. That is the way the system runs at present. We can make out a very good case for changing it, but until that occurs that is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an exchange of letters between the Attorney-General's Department and the ACT Administration has forgone $117,000 of its Budget allocation to allow the Attorney-General's Department to pay for additional services of the court to recover these moneys. There is something seriously wrong with our system when to get justice through the Magistrates Court we have to pay for it in that fashion. While the Government is running the court system it is obliged to provide the facilities to see that the work that should be done by the court in fact can be done-otherwise, change the system. The Government, for reasons best known to itself, has retained the running of the Magistrates Court, at least until 1990. The Magistrates Court will not be passing to the ACT government next year when other functions pass to it. I would say that the Government is obliged to provide this community with a magistrates court which functions properly and is able to do what it is required to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that the Attorney-General's Department blames the Department of Finance for this problem. The Department of Finance may set the amount of money that is available, but it is the Attorney-General's Department and the Government which set the priorities for the way in which the money is spent. Clearly the ACT Magistrates Court, either in the mind of the Government or in the mind of the Attorney-General's Department, has a very low priority. I say to the Minister as an elected member of this community, that that is unacceptable. I also understand that the Budget shortfall on present indications will be significant. About 70 per cent of what has been allocated this year has already been spent. What happens when 100 per cent has been spent in a very short time? There is no doubt that the staff and magistrates of the court are clearly, reasonably and understandably demoralised by the way they have been treated by their own Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking of being demoralised, I want to refer to the matter that the Minister was probably alluding to when I started, that of the remuneration of magistrates. It is an absolute disgrace that magistrates' salaries are not being increased and are just under $66,000 at a time when we are looking at a proposed increase to the salary of the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to $180,000; ACT Supreme Court judges to $180,000; and Family Court judges to $162,000. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the figures that have been deemed fair and reasonable for those positions. I have already pointed out to the chamber that magistrates do a considerable amount of work that is done similarly by judges in the Family Court. The difference in salary? Under $66,000 for one and $162,000 for the other. I do not know how the Minister can sit there and contemplate paying magistrates at that rate when comparing them with the others in the judicial system. The magistrates are still being treated as poor relations. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been changes in the last 30 years. A long time ago the magistrates courts were called the courts of petty sessions. Such courts had little judicial responsibility and were presided over by people who were not legally qualified. That is not the case now and has not been the case for a very long time. The magistrates court is a court of significant judicial responsibility and magistrates ought to be paid accordingly. They are people who have been practising in the legal profession for many years and they ought to be remunerated in accordance with the work they are doing. Do not tell me that they are being paid what the Remuneration Tribunal thinks they are worth because, if that is the case, I would say that it is time the Government had a look at who is sitting on the Tribunal because it clearly does not understand the work of the magistrates court and the very important role that it plays in our community. The Tribunal ought to have its attention drawn to the list of functions carried out by the court that I read out earlier from the Government's own papers in relation to this section of the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The remuneration of the magistrates is a disgrace and ought to be looked at. We will not get good people running magistrates courts if we do not pay them a little better. I have already indicated that a Family Court judge is worth $162,000. A magistrate must be worth something near that, not what he is being paid at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had some conversations with the Chief Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Ron Cahill, I think only on Tuesday morning, and I understand very well the constraints under which the magistracy in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) feels it is operating. I believe that it is very significant that the exercise being undertaken to review the resources for the ACT Magistrates Court is progressing extremely well. The Chief Magistrate reported this to me and, as Senator Reid knows, he is chairman of the steering committee to which the working committee reports and makes its various suggestions. It will be incumbent on government to take very seriously the matters which arise out of that review which is being undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the resources available, Senator Reid will know that, as was indicated at the Estimates Committee, a misleading impression was given because of the presentation of the explanatory notes and the expenditure amounts in terms of not indicating clearly that the Supreme Court estimates included an amount which really would be devoted to administration of the magistrates courts. As I understand it, the various allocations between those two items will be adjusted in a way which makes it clearer as the year goes on that those moneys will be available, as they properly ought to be, to the Magistrates Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid mentioned so much. The ACT Administration provided $117,000 for the provision of a magistrate and his supporting staff to deal with parking fines. Indeed, from the point of view of the ACT Administration, that will prove to be a very worthwhile investment: it will get much more than the $117,000 it spends on the support of the Magistrates Court in that respect. But I agree with Senator Reid that parking matters are a most inappropriate, time consuming and wasteful use of the Magistrates Court. The Government is moving to bring about a new system in relation to those who refuse to pay fines levied in respect of certain offences such as parking. I agree that the sooner that alternative scheme can be brought into operation the better. It ought to have been looked at a lot earlier. I hope that the alternative scheme will free the magistrates to concentrate on the sort of work which Senator Reid outlined as more properly characteristic of carrying out a judicial function which is satisfying for a person with the sort of training that magistrates have. </PARA>
<PARA> Magistrates have a wide range of matters to deal with. Many and various jurisdictions have been added in a sort of ad hoc manner over the years and I believe that magistrates' work has undergone a qualitative change. Nevertheless, I have to point out that the Remuneration Tribunal has examined the matter and has not seen fit to increase magistrates' salaries beyond the 3 per cent increase. Indeed, the salary for an ACT magistrate of $65,653 compares reasonably well with the lower end of the scale across Australia. Magistrates in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have similar salaries: Western Australia is exceptional with a level of $75,000. The first three States I mentioned pay salaries in the region of $70,000 to $72,000 a year. In Tasmania the level is $64,345 and in the Northern Territory, $65,000. It will be seen that the salary set by the Remuneration Tribunal-not by the Government-for ACT magistrates of $65,653 is consistent with the lower end of the scale. I can assure Senator Reid that Mr Cahill in his representations to me made it clear that in order to continue to attract good persons to the bench, which naturally is his desire, he would wish to see an increase in that level of remuneration. I am simply pointing out that the level is not out of kilter with that available to magistrates in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid pointed out the time that it can take to have a matter dealt with. I do not have any scale or graph in front of me outlining delays. They are always a cause of concern to the people involved in whatever jurisdiction they occur. Any undue delay is troubling and sometimes traumatic. In relation to domestic violence, I do not think the figure Senator Reid gave is right. I understand from Mr Cahill's conversation with me that an interim order can be obtained from a court within a couple of hours. Such orders deal with a great majority of domestic violence cases, which is a very large and growing jurisdiction for the courts in the Australian Capital Territory. In short, I believe that the Government, as indicated by setting up of the review into the resources available to the ACT magistracy and with other matters being undertaken such as the new regime to deal with parking fines, has a willingness to ensure that the ACT magistracy is adequately able to perform its very important task in this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without going over it all again, there are one or two comments I would like to make in reply. I am aware of the review and what is going and and I hope that will come to something and that computerisation and things of that nature will be introduced. That too has been somewhat delayed. I am pleased to hear that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has talked to the Chief Magistrate about these matters. My discussions have been principally with members of the legal profession who deal in the area. The Minister may talk to them at some stage as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of salaries, I recognise the figures that the Minister gave. As he said, the Australian Capital Territory rate tends to be at the lower end of the scale of magistrates' pay but the Minister must remember that there is no District Court in the Australian Capital Territory; the Magistrates Court is the only stage between not being in court at all and being in the Supreme Court. That is a significant difference. I believe that, if we have a Tribunal that just does not understand the place of the Magistrates Court here, some adjustment to the make-up of the Tribunal is necessary. It is obvious that the Tribunal has no understanding of the fact that magistrates do work that is so similar to the work of the Family Court judges when a Family Court judge has a salary of $162,000 and the salary of a magistrate is under $66,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments about the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). Both the written evidence and the oral evidence supplied to Estimates Committee E confirmed the dreadful situation that the Government has now foisted upon the NCSC, which is the nation's corporate watchdog. There has been a massive increase in corporate crime in recent years. We were told at the hearing that the major areas of concern are insider trading, market manipulation, the warehousing of shares and directors' fiduciary duties. Yet, despite the massive increase in corporate crime, which is recognised generally, the Government will not provide the NCSC with the necessary resources to police these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In real terms the NCSC is going backwards in its resources. It is being progressively starved, in a period which has included the largest stock market crash in our history. But despite the crash and, therefore, the increased role of the NCSC, the Government has determined a reduction in the approved staffing level for the NCSC, which has been cut back from 82 to 79. This year funding for the NCSC has fallen by 4 per cent in real terms. At the Estimates hearing the Executive Director of the Commission, Mr Schoer, gave evidence that the financial and other constraints imposed on the NCSC by the Government have meant:</PARA>
<PARA>Since the crash, there have been many more problems in the corporate sector and more risks are being taken by some of the entrepreneurs, which has meant that the Commission has had to be engaged in much more investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a large number of inquiries we would have wished to make but could not. </PARA>
<PARA>As well, despite the fact that the Government's proposal to replace the NCSC with an Australian Securities Commission-I will get to that in a moment-has yet to pass the Parliament and, indeed, may never do so, in this year's Budget appropriations $1m is allocated for pre-establishment costs for the ASC. I ask the Minister; What is going to happen to those funds if they are not expended? If they are going to be expended this year, given the delays that have occurred, precisely on what matters are they going to be expended? It is interesting to note that Mr Schoer told us in the Estimates Committee hearing that the Commission had `fairly minimal involvement with the Attorney-General's corporate securities legislative package', and that it was not involved in discussions relating to the drafting of the legislation. I find it extraordinary that the body with the greatest expertise in the whole area of corporate law so far as the operation of the securities and financial markets is concerned was not involved at all in the drafting of a whole new panoply of securities law and legislation. Obviously, there is a conflict between the NCSC and the Attorney-General's Department in various respects. That was quite evident from an answer provided to us stating that according to the NCSC the proposed new corporate legislative package would not have allowed the NCSC, for example, to have played the role it did in investigating the bid by Bond for the Bell Group. That is the view of the NCSC. It appears not to be the view of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me greatly that the NCSC is being starved of funds to carry out its legitimate and mandatory watchdog responsibilities over the Australian securities and financial markets at a time when there has never been a greater need for that, and at a time when the Commission is being given-rightly so-an investigative role in regard to Rothwells Ltd, Ariadne and some other important examples. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the reason why the resources are not being adequately provided to the NCSC is that the Government wishes deliberately to stretch the NCSC to the limit and beyond so that it can then have more justification and support for its proposals to introduce the enormously centralist, socialist and bureaucratically engineered ASC to replace the NCSC and to redraw the corporate law picture. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; as my colleague Senator Messner says, it could well be intended to draw a blind or a cover-up over what is going on in the other States, particularly in Western Australia where the recent activities of the Western Australian Government have been described, very appropriately, as WA Inc. The Western Australian Government has become involved with the private sector and with big business, putting at risk hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. This Government is refusing to make the necessary investigations into the matter. To some degree the NCSC has now been asked to play a role regarding the Rothwells debacle. If the Government were fair dinkum about it, it would have a much broader inquiry. It would have a royal commission into the whole matter. If it is not going to do that, it should certainly provide the NCSC with the resources to do a proper job on the Rothwells investigation without so drawing its resources into that area that it is unable to carry out its important undertakings in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is not the reason why the Government is refusing to provide adequate funding to the NCSC, and why it is cutting it back significantly in real terms,-it is not just this year; it has happened progressively over the last two or three years-I hope that the Minister will inform the Committee what the legitimate reason is. Particularly at this time, it is an extraordinary example of a misallocation government priorities if the Government is going to deny funds in areas such as this whilst at the same time continuing to give enormous grants in the form of hand-outs to its mates all around the place across the board of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never thought that Senator Short would sound like President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. For him to start railing against the proposed Australian Securities Commission (ASC) as being a centralised, bureaucratic, socialist monster-a Stalinist model, no doubt-shows that rhetoric has got the better of him. The fact is that funds for the operation of the National Companies and Securities Commission have not been affected in order to make the ASC proposal look better; nor is it the case that a cover-up has been attempted in order to starve the NCSC of sufficient resources adequately to undertake its investigation of the matters surrounding the collapse of Rothwells Ltd. As I have pointed out in this chamber before, I had the very good fortune to bump into Mr Bosch at Tullamarine Airport on Monday morning. I specifically asked him whether he had sufficient resources to undertake the inquiry into Rothwells. He said yes. He said that it could be got off the ground in a speedy and timely way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt, the Ministerial Council, which is meeting tomorrow, and for which the Attorneys have come from all over Australia to Canberra, will be able to further consider the matter in light of the various reports that will be available to it from the National Companies and Securities Commission and from the auditors, in relation to Rothwells. I believe that will enable them to determine whether the section 36 investigation, with all the power available to the NCSC under section 37, is indeed adequate. The fact is that the NCSC could have approached a relevant State Minister or the Commonwealth Minister in order to suggest that an investigation be undertaken under some other section of the legislation. It has not done so. I believe that that indicates that it believes at the moment that the sorts of hearings it will undertake speedily-or at least get off the ground speedily-will help to unravel this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for neither of those reasons that there has been any reduction in resources. Speaking of the Ministerial Council brings one back to the central point that the NCSC is funded by governments, not by the Federal Government alone. It is the responsibility of all participating governments from around Australia, the various jurisdictions, to provide the funds to make the NCSC operate efficiently and well. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be remarkable if there were collusion-which is what the honourable senator must be suggesting-between all the members of the NCSC, representing all of the governments of different political complexions around Australia, to starve the NCSC of funds.

From my experience of Estimates committees, both as a senator posing questions and as a Minister, what is of most concern about the NCSC, and the Trade Practices Commission to a lesser extent, is not so much the number of persons who are available to it under average staffing levels, which is, after all, a fairly artificial concept, but the quality of the people and the means to hold on to them in a marketplace, particularly in Melbourne--</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, to some extent, the same general matter explains the Remuneration Tribunal's decision in relation to judicial salaries.

Clearly, there is some preliminary work which must be undertaken by any responsible government in the anticipation that once the Parliament passes the legislation, the Parliament intends that the various administrative and other machinery operates as soon as possible. It is in relation to that anticipation of the Parliament's will, and in order to facilitate the Parliament's will when the legislation is passed, that the expenditure is undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on a matter that pertains to the functions of the Attorney-General as they relate to the operation of the Australian Constitution. In today's Adelaide Advertiser there is an article headlined, `Haines sacrifices all for Hindmarsh'. It is to do with the proposal that Senator Haines leave the Senate and run for the Federal division of Hindmarsh. The import of the story is that Senator Haines will make a gigantic sacrifice, a throw of the dice on a winner-take-all basis: she will either win in Hindmarsh or she will be out of politics altogether. I will quote three or four paragraphs from this article, because it relates to the functions of filling a Senate vacancy under the Constitution of Australia. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Janine Haines is set to take a giant step into the political unknown.</PARA>
<PARA> The first woman leader of an Australian political party plans to give up her safe Senate seat in a bid to make the Australian Democrats a more credible national political force. </PARA>
<PARA> In a double dissolution of Federal Parliament, only a dramatic change to South Australia's voting patterns would see Senator Haines lose the seat she has held since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> If the federal election expected about the end of next year involves a half-Senate poll (as widely predicted), she would not even need to face the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines has decided to sacrifice that security to resign from Parliament and run for the western suburban Adelaide seat of Hindmarsh-where the Democrats managed only 8 per cent vote in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I wish to make, which this story does not conclude, and which Senator Haines has not stated, is that if a half Senate election is held next year, Senator Haines will be making no sacrifice at all. If she runs for Hindmarsh and, as expected, loses comprehensively the seat to the sitting Labor member, she can be reappointed for the rest of her unexpired term. She has a great opportunity, that does not come to many people in politics, of being able to win both sides of the bet. If she wins Hindmarsh, she will be in the lower House but, if, as expected, she loses, she will not lose anything, because under the constitutional change of 1977, her Party, the Australian Democrats has the right to nominate the replacement to fill the vacancy. Who are they going to nominate? There is no doubt that when Senator Haines loses in Hindmarsh they will nominate her to fill the rest of her unexpired term. So there is no sacrifice by Senator Haines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the comments that some of the Labor senators opposite have made-they seem to think this is going to take ages-I can assure them that if we are given good and prompt answers we will attempt to deal with this matter as expeditiously as we possibly can. However, that is not to deny the serious issues that have arisen in the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the very issues that have attracted probably paramount press coverage in the last six or eight weeks. The fact that so much concentration by both the House of Representatives and this chamber has had to be made in the determination to clear up and to clean up a stack of issues relating to the administration of Aboriginal affairs is I think indicative of the extreme concern felt about this portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will see in the Estimates Committee E report a reservation expressed by Senator Durack, Senator Short and me. In discussing the maladministration of the Department by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, we came down in that reservation comment with the point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we consider the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to have been derelict in the exercise of his Ministerial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be surer than that statement, as has been borne out by the fact, as I said in my speech during the second reading stage the other day, that 400 questions were put on notice and some 200 to 300 questions were subsequently asked by Senator Short and me during the hearing. Of course the matter has also been under very important consideration in the House of Representatives, because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has instituted four Public Service inquiries into this portfolio since the consideration of the Estimates started on 21 October-four Public Service inquiries in addition to the three parliamentary inquiries that are already under way. That is a damning indictment of what has gone on. As I said, the House of Representatives has also given, through questions and through debate, considerable attention to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to the statements of my colleague, Mr Roger Shipton, the honourable member for Higgins in Victoria, who has repeatedly raised issues also with regard to this portfolio. In particular, today in the House of Representatives we saw one of the most shameful parliamentary performances ever. I remind the chamber that earlier this week the Government accepted for debate a censure motion on the Prime Minister relating to Mr Kornhauser. But what happened today when a censure motion was proposed involving the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand? It was gagged, it was stopped, it was thwarted at every move. Honourable senators probably heard the bells ringing a number of times when between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. members in the House of Representatives were repeatedly gagged. Why did that matter arise? It arose because of the question that Mr Shipton originally put forward on 8 November, seeking additional information with regard to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO). On that particular occasion Mr Shipton asked the Minister whether his predecessor, the present Minister for the Arts and Territories stopped:</PARA>
<PARA>funding to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation because of malpractices and financial abuse? Has the Minister recommenced funding to that organisation; and if so, on what grounds? Was his predecessor wrong in stopping such funding? in any event, will the Minister have NAIHO investigated by the Auditor-General and the inquiries that the Government has established?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hand responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, there was an internal inquiry conducted into matters concerning the funding arrangements for NAIHO by my predecessor; and funding did cease. Since that period, there has been a restructuring of the body known as NAIHO. Thirdly, I have met with representatives of that body and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. I am yet to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement by the Minister flies in the face of the minutes of a meeting of senior officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs held on 5 September in which, when referring to NAIHO, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting with the Minister on Thursday 1 September, the Minister directed that NAIHO received $180,000 this year in funding. This is to be confirmed in writing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not at this stage. However, I take this to be a true and correct record. I would foreshadow at this stage that I propose to move an amendment, and that amendment will read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, having considered the Report of Estimates Committee E in relation to the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Committee recommends that the Senate agree to the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the table of the Senate on or before 5 December 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) A copy of the report of auditors Arthur Andersen and Co., referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the course of his reply to a question without notice by the member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) in the House of Representatives on 8 November 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A copy of the record of proceedings of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs senior officers' meeting held on 5 September 1988; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A copy of any note for file made by Mr McDonald, as senior officer of Department of Aboriginal Affairs, recording his meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 1 September, during which the issue of funding for NAIHO was discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the amendment that I will move. This is a most important issue because what arises out of it is the very point that Senator Durack, Senator Short and I made in our reservation report to Estimates Committee E; that is, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been derelict in the exercise of his ministerial responsibilities. If it is borne out that those minutes are in exactly the terms that I have before me, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs lied to the Parliament today. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This goes very much to the core of everything that we have been saying, that all is not well with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It certainly is not so. I want to talk about the points I made with regard to the four inquiries that the Government has had to institute and that the Prime Minister has had to put in place. It is unfortunate that we have not been given any terms of reference for those inquiries. They are very general. We certainly know that the Auditor General has been brought in. We know that the Public Service Commissioner has been brought in. We know that the Department of Finance has been asked to report on the accounting and administrative procedures. We know that Mr Menzies has been appointed to pick up the other matters and the legal issues that subsequently arise. I am sure that that is an acknowledgment by the Prime Minister that all of the issues that were raised in Senate Estimates Committee E were very serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also of major concern that we were dissatisfied totally with the quality of the performance indicators that were provided by the Department. Yet the Department has such an onerous responsibility in serving Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The fact that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission between them administer funds of $468m is indicative of the extent of their responsibilities and the problems that they have to fact up to. Yet these four inquiries that the Government has instituted do not provide any mechanisms for public participation, for people in the community to be able to make an input. There is no protection of witnesses or for the way in which they can come forward. In the representations that have been made to me in the last month or so that has been the major concern expressed by many of the constituents who have come forward and provided additional information. </PARA>
<PARA> I have passed the information to the Auditor-General. Where constituents have requested that their identity remain anonymous I have respected that. I have passed their assertions to the Auditor-General and asked him to investigate and report on them. Yet there is no mechanism by which I can be assured that the Auditor-General's report is going to be tabled in this Parliament. It, very obviously, will have to be tendered to the Prime Minister or to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. What joy does that give us? It certainly does not give us any. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the way in which the Department has been administered, particularly since the Federal election last year when Mr Hand assumed the portfolio responsibility, we have nothing but cause for concern. The way in which Mr Hand walked in and dismissed eight credible Aboriginal leaders in Australia from the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission in May was absolutely disgraceful. The new appointees, who were appointed almost immediately afterwards, did not file their required pecuniary interest forms until some date in November, which was five to six months after their initial appointment and only after continual probing by Senator Short and myself in the Estimates committee. Charles Perkins did not lodge his pecuniary interest form until after he was sacked. How damned serious can we get when issues like this keep arising?</PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative and Clerical Officers Association certainly raised many issues with Minister Hand in a very important letter very early in the Minister's administration. Yet the Minister and Charles Perkins chose to file that letter. It did not get passed down through the Department for corrective action below the level of the Secretary. It did not reach the other officers of the Department who could have worked on it. The Minister may have been mulling it over since November or December of last year but he did not ask or put in train any effective new principles or administrative procedures within his department. </PARA>
<PARA> It can only be said that the entire administration and the manner in which the Department was administered by Mr Perkins and the Minister were disgraceful. If the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will permit me, may I also refer to a copy of the minutes by the senior officers of 5 September. Let me highlight another issue which brings out the point of poor administration or perhaps some funny business at the crossroads by Charles Perkins. Under a separate issue entirely from the one that I raised earlier, the document refers to the Secretary, Mr Perkins. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary asked for inquiries to be made about the feasibility of holding a combined State Directors Regional Managers meeting in Adelaide two days prior to the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide. Mr Miller, who indicated that the meeting was not practical because of accommodation shortages, was asked to follow up the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Can he investigate what happened around the time of the Adelaide Grand Prix? Did the officers of the Department-without, of course, Charles Perkins because he was sacked in the interim-get their fares paid to go to meetings prior to the Grand Prix? Did they then meet on the Monday and Tuesday? Of course, the Grand Prix was held on Saturday, 12 November, and Sunday, 13 November. Did the officers then attend meetings with the Minister on the Monday and Tuesday prior to there being, in the couple of days after that, the next meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council? The fact that the Secretary, Mr Perkins-as I said, I am quoting from these minutes-asked about inquiries to be made about the feasibility of holding a meeting in Adelaide two days prior is so similar to so many of the other issues that were raised by Mr Perkins. If one goes through the transcript of Senate Estimates Committee E and sees the 40-odd occasions on which we put questions to Mr Perkins and he could not recall or had amnesia-often for things that happened a week earlier-one sees that it certainly did not blend well for a happy, effective or proper administration of that portfolio. The fact that the Minister obviously did not have his hand on his Secretary-pardon the pun-also points to many areas of slack administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Prime Minister has announced that the Government will have a total rethink about the proposal for the formation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). I quote from a press report of 9 November. The Canberra Times reported the Prime Minister as `thinking of some possible changes in approach on this matter' by Mr Hand. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke said he thought the concept of the commission was sound, but Mr Hand was considering `alternatives or refinements'. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on it said:</PARA>
<PARA>The minister would not go back to Aboriginal communities with yet another start-up date, but would look at options such as administrative changes which did not need legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome any change by the Prime Minister, because this whole area of ATSIC needs to be totally reviewed. It is not a matter of just crashing through into something new to achieve aims. This Senate has very properly put in place the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to look into the whole ambit of that administration. From the Hansard reports of that Committee's hearings, which I have read, and submissions that people have made to that Committee, it is very obvious that overwhelming evidence is building up that Aboriginal people throughout Australia are not happy with the principles of Mr Hand's proposals for ATSIC. Obviously there are many inherent flaws. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Democrats agreed to the initial deferment of the legislation they put out a press release listing seven areas which would require amendment. As I am aware-and I am sure Senator Collins from the Northern Territory is too-the traditional Aboriginal communities throughout northern Australia are far from happy with the proposals that are being put forward. The fact that there has to be a total rethink in this area points up the fact that we cannot go marching into some new, big, bandaided area. If we do, in four or five years time we will have another massive blow-out of a bureaucracy that will not meet the requirements of the Australian taxpayer or the Aboriginal community. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because there are real concerns; I agree with that. I am merely saying that it is wrong to give the impression that, because 400 questions were put on notice and another 300 were asked in Estimates Committee E, there are 700 matters wrong in the administration of Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia by the Federal Government. That is the sort of impression that that sort of assertion conveys. Nevertheless, there were some matters of concern and hence those inquiries have been established. Since the announcement of those inquiries, it has been generally agreed that they will provide a comprehensive and adequate framework for these matters of concern to be properly examined. This is particularly so when one takes into account the role to be played by Mr Andrew Menzies in coming to his independent assessment of whether the two or three inquiries being undertaken, for example, by the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance and the Public Service Commissioner, have been able to cover all the ground of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Various allegations have been made. Senator Tambling referred to a letter from the national secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, Ms Ann Forward. In the Estimates Committee, as I recall, the various elements of that letter were gone through sentence by sentence and refutation was offered sentence by sentence by the officers who were being questioned. The sorts of allegations that were made in that letter were sufficiently answered by members of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who attended that Committee hearing. Nevertheless, that letter continues to get a run as though it had never been the subject of refutation and explanation at the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling has gone in for his usual smear campaign-and that is a very unfortunate tendency-in relation to the holding of the meeting of certain officers from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and State Directors during the weekend of the Adelaide Grand Prix. For example, I have here today advising me on Estimates two officers from that Department who have indicated to me that the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council (AAAC), which I assume is the Ministerial Council, was due to meet on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the week after the Grand Prix. Given the removal of the Secretary to the Department, obviously there would have been consternation and a need for consultation between the various elements of the portfolio from around Australia and also officers would have needed to consult in order to advise the Minister about the forthcoming Ministerial Council meeting. So it was determined that State directors and members of Central Office should meet in Adelaide on the Monday and Tuesday preceeding the AAAC. That is not an uncommon occurrence with Ministerial Councils. In fact, officials do usually meet a day or so before the Council meeting, wherever it is held, in order to check on the agenda with their counterparts and provide a full assessment of the really important matters on the agenda which may have been determined some weeks or even months before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I merely stress to the Minister the point that I made in quoting from the copy of the minutes available to me. I was making a firm criticism of Mr Perkins, who initiated the request that that senior officers meeting be held in the two days prior to the Grand Prix. It was that point that I was seeking to stress, to point out the unguided missile type of administration that Mr Perkins obviously led in the Department. I am not saying that other officers complied or would have claimed. That is probably a matter for next year's Senate Estimates committees to determine-who claimed travelling allowance and the amounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise two other issues with regard to this portfolio. One is the matter that we raised, both in the majority report of Estimates Committee E and in the reservation, with regard to the funding of Tranby College. In the reservation we questioned the propriety of allocating some $500,000 for conferences to be organised by the college around Australia with regard to an Aboriginal treaty. Subsequent answers that came in following the Estimates Committee hearings were conflicting. First, we received an answer which said that, legally, the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was not in a position to make that funding available. Subsequently-I think it was yesterday-I received a rethink answer on that issue saying that the ADC had since gone out and sought the opinion of a Queen's Counsel, who obviously has now found a way in which it could be argued that that $500,000 could be made available legally. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point of my argument is that, again, this is six months after the event. The decision on that was taken back in June. That advice should have been on the table before the board of commissioners-whether it was a QC's opinion which said, `Yes, here is the loophole' or the original Attorney-General's Department advice which was, `No, you cannot do it'. I imagine that, if the original Attorney-General's Department advice had been on the table at the commissioners' meeting, the commissioners would have backed off and not even bothered to have sought a QC's opinion. It is disgraceful. That half a million dollars to achieve other objectives was very questionable, as I said at the time of the Estimates Committee and in my speech at the second reading stage, given the circumstances of the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address the relationship between; Mr Kevin Cooke, the Administrator of Tranby college, who is also the convener of the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations; Pat Dodson, the Chairman of the ADC Coordinating Committee supervising the half a million dollars of expenditure and who is also a leader of the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations; and Mr Kevin Tory of the Trade Union Committee on Aboriginal Rights, who has identified himself as one of the three people organising consultations on an Aboriginal treaty. How in the heck can Mr Kevin Tory claim to have any authority in this regard? He is not a commissioner or a staff member of the ADC, as far as I am aware. He is not a public servant within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, as far as I am aware. He is from the Trade Union Committee on Aboriginal Rights. I find it strangely coincidental that that organisation has the same mailing address as the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, with which Mr Riley from the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has a very close link, and with which Mr Dodson from Alice Springs, who is certainly one of the new commissioners of the ADC, and Mr O'Shane, one of the activists from Queensland who is also a commissioner of the ADC, have links. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which this half a million dollars has been funnelled and channelled from the Government deserves very quick and particular comment. I believe that earlier this week Mr Hawke attended a conference of Aboriginal people at which the treaty was again under consideration. He was questioned about it. An Australian Associated Press (AAP) report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We spoke to Prime Minister Hawke two weeks ago and asked him if the commitment was still strong. He said it was . . . we told him that it wasn't going to happen as quickly as he thought. </PARA>
<PARA>A further AAP report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Aborigines could take up to five years to decide whether they want to sign a treaty with the Australian Government . . . Kevin Tory, one of three Aboriginal men organising nationwide meetings of indigenous people to discuss the proposal, said the process of achieving any sort of consensus concerning a treaty was necessarily slow. </PARA>
<PARA>My question is: is the $1.9m set aside in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for public awareness campaigns going to go on and on for five years? This half a million dollars is being channelled through funny front organisations which have links with community groups, and whose participants certainly have a conflict of interest, and, as we mentioned in Estimates Committee E, a college which has tenuous links with Cuba and Nicaragua. Is this the way this Government is going to organise its consultations on treaties around Australia? It is a very serious issue to be addressed by this Government. The Prime Minister said at Burunga in the Northern Territory in June that he was going to institute a special group of seven Aboriginal elders who would be responsible for the treaty negotiations that the Government wanted. That has not happened. There has been no contact with the traditional cultural leaders, other than Galarrwuy Yunupingu of the Northern Land Council, who is a mate of Mr Hand. The traditional Aboriginal people have been left out in the cold. This funny crowd of people in Sydney, from Tranby College, with its peculiar links to the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, which is made up basically of urban radical Aboriginals, is the body doing the Government's bidding. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I comment on the land council movement in the Northern Territory where breakaway movements are arising because of the ineptitude of Minister Hand and the way in which he has handled the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposal and is insulting the traditional Aboriginals of northern Australia. I am aware, and I am sure Senator Bob Collins is also, that some five or six other groups in the Northern Territory are currently saying, `We want out of the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council because the Minister's, Mr Hand's, mates are in there running the show. They are fiddling around with the way it is all being done'. We need to be mindful of the fact that the administrative funds available to the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council are in excess of $11m per annum. It makes them a very powerful propaganda machine doing the Government's bidding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner some matters were raised concerning Tranby College. I am advised that all Aboriginal Development Commission-Tranby files have been sealed in preparation for the Auditor-General's investigation. As a consequence, officers have not been able to get details concerning office holders of Tranby College from their files, as was requested. Kevin Tory is employed, we believe, by the Trade Union Campaign Against Racism but the ADC officers present do not know whether he is a director of Tranby, for the reasons that I have given. However, he is closely associated with Tranby. Kevin Cook has been closely associated with Tranby for several years but officers present do not know whether he is a director.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is widely known that people associated with Tranby have contact with a wide diversity of people and organisations. As was established at the Estimates Committee, I think Tranby was founded by a Christian pastor and has been in existence since 1957. It is a registered charity and has a reputation for being generally well run. At present, officers do not have information concerning the names of directors. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also asked about links with Nicaragua and Cuba which were put forward in a way which I suppose was intended to colour Tranby as being some radical organisation. As I understand it, some students associated with Tranby have applied, not to the ADC or to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but to the Department of Employment, Education and Training, for some assistance in their work experience program. Some students have nominated Cuba or Nicaragua, as officials understand it, for participation in the funding available from that portfolio. But officials in this portfolio are unable to say whether that application has been successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for that information. I want to say something about the task that Tranby College has been given to work on the promotion of the treaty proposal. In doing so, I support very strongly the remarks made by Senator Tambling earlier. If one looks at the answers that have been given to questions asked at the Senate Estimates Committee hearings-in particular, a question asked by Senator Collins requesting details about the nature of Tranby College-it is clear that one would have considerable doubts as to the reasons why the college would be the recipient of $420,000 of the $500,000 allocated for the promotion of the treaty proposal. The answer that was received in the last couple of weeks in response to the question that was left on notice by Senator Collins states, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd (CAL) known as Tranby College is a registered charity organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>We knew that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>CAL was formerly called ABM Christian Community Co-operative Ltd but on 7 September-</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that means 7 September 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>the NSW Co-operative Act registered a change of name from ABMCCL to the Co-operative for Aborigines Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit of technical background. The point I want to make refers to the next part of the answer which was provided, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tranby College is basically involved in the area of preparatory tertiary education for Aboriginals. For example it conducts courses in Bookkeeping, Business Studies etc. In addition it is involved in training for Aboriginal organisations and Land Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also a consulting unit called the Aboriginal Development Unit which provides consultancy on training and local studies such as the recent social study on Toomelah. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: In light of the answer that has been provided and the description that has been given of the role of Tranby College, how does he see that college and the work it does-basically it is involved in the area of preparatory tertiary education for Aborigines-justifying the grant of almost half a million dollars to give it the prime role in the promotion of and discussions on the treaty proposal? It is not obvious to me that there is any relationship between the background of Tranby College and the role it performs that would equip it to do that. I think that is a very important question that I would certainly want answered. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to pick up and develop the point that was made earlier by Senator Tambling. He advised the Senate of the change in advice that we had received as to whether, legally, Tranby College was a body with which the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), which granted these funds, could have dealings. The information that was provided-I presume by the ADC rather than the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; it does not really matter which one-to the Estimates Committee was received by me on 23 November. Senator Tambling's question was:</PARA>
<PARA>In legal terms under the ADC Act, is Tranby College a body with which the ADC could have dealings?</PARA>
<PARA>I receive this response on 23 November:</PARA>
<PARA>In legal terms, no. The College does not meet the Aboriginal objects clause required under section 4 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>If that was the advice that was provided to this chamber on 23 November I want to know how it was possible for the ADC to make a grant of $420,000 to Tranby College for the purpose of promoting the treaty if the legal position, as seen by the ADC on 23 November, was that it was not legal to do so. Was any legal advice taken at the time the decision was made to make the grant to Tranby College? What legal advice did the ADC have at that stage? Why was the legal advice that it received on 23 November, that the college could not have had dealings with the ADC, overturned when on 30 November we were advised that the answer to Senator Tambling's question, which was received on 30 November, said, `The answer provided on 22 November stating ``no'' was incorrect.'? I quote again from the answer provided on 30 November. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Legal opinion recently provided by a Queen's Counsel is that the College is an `Aboriginal body' as defined in the ADC Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ADC regional office considered Tranby College was an Aboriginal Body and released grant funds. Following receipt of Question E 336-</PARA>
<PARA>that was the one on notice from Senator Tambling that came forward in the Estimates Committee hearing-</PARA>
<PARA>the legal opinion of the ADC's Principal Legal Officer was sought. His written opinion was that Tranby College was not an Aboriginal Body for the purposes of the Act. The response of 22 November was based on that opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> At the request of the Deputy Chairman a Queen's Counsel was briefed to provide his legal opinion as the interpretation of Section 4 of the Act was a crucial aspect in determining the Commission's funding program. Written opinion dated 25 November was that Tranby College is an Aboriginal Body as defined by Section 4 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission apologises for its earlier incorrect answer. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the end of the answer provided. That raises far more questions that it answers. For example, who was the Queen's Counsel? When was the Queen's Council's advice requested and when was it received? It says that it was `recently provided'. What legal opinion existed at the time that the ADC made its decision to grant the $420,000 to Tranby College? Has the Attorney-General's Department expressed a view on the Queen's Counsel's opinion? What does the Attorney-General's Department think? What do the Government's own legal advisers think about this QC's opinion? Why is this QC's opinion so sacrosanct? Whether the QC's opinion is right or wrong, the great unanswered question is: on what legal basis did the ADC grant that $420,000 to Tranby College in July or August? It may have been May; I am not sure. It was about six months ago. On what legal opinion was the ADC decision based? I repeat: on what criteria did the ADC make the decision to grant that money for the promotion for the treaty proposals to Tranby College, when on the basis of the information supplied to this chamber as to the role of Tranby College there appears to be no logical reason at all as to why it would be a worthy recipient of those funds, a recipient that would be able to utilise those funds to meet the objectives of the original grant? There are some quite major questions involved and I hope the Minister will be able to provide some answers before we approve the appropriations for this Department. I want to return to the motion that was foreshadowed by Senator Tambling before dinner. Unfortunately he is unable to be here tonight. On his behalf I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That, having considered the report of Estimates Committee E in relation to the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Committee recommends that the Senate agree to the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>That there be laid on the table of the Senate on or before 5 December 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) A copy of the report of auditors Arthur Andersen and Co., referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the course of this reply to a question without notice by the member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) in the other place on 8 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA>(b) A copy of the record of proceedings of the Department Aboriginal Affairs senior officers' meeting held on 5 September 1988</PARA>
<PARA>(c) A copy of any note for file made by Mr McDonald, as senior officer of DAA, recording his meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 1 September, during which the issue of funding for NAIHO was discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to a couple of other points. The first is in response to a written answer provided by the Department to a question on notice that I raised with it in the course of the Estimates hearings. It related to grants being made available to trade unions and community organisations over the last five financial years by the Department or its statutory authorities, and what was the situation in so far as outstanding reports were concerned? Without quoting the whole thing I note that in 1986-87 a total of 34 grant recipients had outstanding reports, and that in 1987-88 there was a total of 251 grant recipients with outstanding reports, the majority of which are quarterly reports for the period 31 April 1988 to 30 June 1988. When will those reports be available? It is now five months since the end of that financial year, and to have 251 grant recipients not having put in a financial report is, in my view, an absolute disgrace as far as the accountability of Government money is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is irrelevant in the sense that the amount of money is going to be large in order to conduct these meetings right around Australia and to provide for consultation by a wide range of Aboriginal persons and institutions and bodies. Senator Short's question is whether Tranby College was a suitable body to undertake this role. I was trying to indicate that not only is it involved in preparatory tertiary education but it is involved in much wider concerns, as shown by its well-known role in relation to Toomelah. Because over 20 years it has obtained support from Aboriginal students from right around Australia, it has such a reputation that it is well placed to undertake the sorts of consultations that are required.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Originally the ADC regional office considered Tranby College was an Aboriginal body and released grant funds. Following receipt of question E336 the legal opinion of the ADC's principal legal officer was sought-not, as Senator Short said before dinner, the Attorney-General's opinion. His written opinion was that Tranby College was not an Aboriginal body for the purposes of the Act. The response of 22 November 1988 was based on that opinion. At the request of the Deputy Chairman, a Queen's Counsel was briefed to provide his legal opinion as the interpretation of section 4 of the Act was a crucial aspect in determining the Commission's funding program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the principal legal officer thought that what was required before the Commission could make money available to an Aboriginal body was that it have in its mandate that it be concerned with economic and social advancement. All that is actually required under law is that it be concerned with the advancement of Aboriginal persons. That has been accepted by the principal legal officer as being a correct interpretation of the legal requirements now that he has had a chance to read the opinion by Michael Adams, QC. It is fairly self-evident. The officer was reading too much into the requirement that there be economic and social advancement clauses written into the mandate of the body receiving money. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now advised that the request was made on 22 November. One can see how important it was for the Aboriginal Development Commission to receive top flight advice because, as I have indicated, the requirement in the objectives clause of Aboriginal bodies as to the type of advancement that should be specified in those objectives is obviously very crucial. The opinion was requested on 22 November and provided and received three days later. I think that is fairly straight forward. I think Senator Short asked a question about grants to trade union bodies or made a general comment about the number of reports which were outstanding. </PARA>

Firstly, I would like to dissociate the Australian Democrats from the smear campaign which I believe was implicit in the remarks Senator Tambling made in speaking to the motion. It was quite unnecessary to range as widely as he did. In seeking this information, which is a perfectly legitimate thing for the Opposition to do, he should have confined himself to those matters and not have ranged as widely as he did, attempting to bring a large number of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations into disrepute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, he was reflecting upon what had happened in the lower House today, where a request was made for this information and the Government evidently used its numbers to close ranks and prevent that information from being made public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement by the Australian Democrats that they will support the motion that I have moved on behalf of Senator Tambling. I totally reject Senator Coulter's comment that Senator Tambling was waging a smear campaign. Senator Tambling was not waging a smear campaign in any way at all. We are discussing the accountability of the hundreds of dollars of public funds that are spent on Aboriginal communities year after year. In the last five years $3.3 billion has been spent, and that is only by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It excludes all the other money spent on these worthwhile issues by other departments. So we are talking about vast sums of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Senator Tambling was saying, what I am saying, and what the Opposition is saying in the whole of this debate is the absolute opposite of a smear campaign. We are saying that the situation that has been disclosed as a result of the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee E, what is going on at the moment in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and in other areas is a sad and tragic example of how a government, perhaps with good intentions, can go wrong in trying to solve problems by throwing taxpayers' money at those problems without having firstly worked out its priorities as to where the money should go and secondly, having thrown the money, being absolutely recalcitrant regarding its accountability. That is what this is all about. At the end of the day the losers are certainly the taxpayers, but the real losers are the members of the Aboriginal communities for whom the funds should have been provided because they were necessary and are needed but who have not received them because they have been wasted, squandered and maladministered. That is what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to Senator Coulter, for him to accuse Senator Tambling of waging a smear campaign demonstrates a strong lack of understanding of what we are talking about in this whole debate. Having said that, I welcome Senator Coulter's comments in support of our motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Tate for his response in relation to the QC's advice. He has said that that request was made on 22 November. It is an exquisite irony, perhaps, at best that that happens to be the very date on which the answer was provided to Senate Estimates Committee E that the making of the grant had been illegal in the sense that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was not legally able to make the grant to Tranby College. That is a remarkable coincidence, at best. Apart from that, it misses the fundamental point; that is, what legal advice was available to the Aboriginal Development Commission when it took its decision months ago to make the grant to Tranby College. It did not have the QC's opinion. Does that mean that it had the opinion of the ADC's principal legal officer, which advice was that it was illegal, or did it have no advice at all? They are the questions that have to be asked. They are the questions to which the Minister is not providing a response. They are the questions that, in the public interest, demand a response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already given an answer but Senator Short seems not to be willing to listen. I have made it very clear that a legal opinion was not provided on this occasion to the Aboriginal Development Commission. It made the assumption, which has since been vindicated by the QC's opinion, that it was quite proper for it to go ahead and provide the money to Tranby College. It was only when, no doubt, frightened-overawed perhaps would be a better word-by some four hundred or five hundred questions on notice that were put down by various Senators for the Estimates Committee, that the principal legal officer, in a situation probably of some pressure, made the wrong assumption, which was that the objectives of the Aboriginal organisation required that there be a note about economic and social advancement. It was on that basis that the answer was provided to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That has such implications for the question of the proper funding of a whole range of organisations that, quite clearly, the decision was properly taken to seek the opinion of a top QC. It was provided, and the result is that the original decision of the Aboriginal Development Commission can be seen to be perfectly in accordance with the proper legal requirements. So the assumption of the Commission at that meeting has, as I say, been vindicated. </PARA>

The comments the Minister has just made on him, on his legal opinion and, therefore, on his expertise, I find absolutely extraordinary. The opinion of the ADC's principal legal officer says that it was not a legal transaction. The Commission has an opinion from someone else who happens to be a QC. I have no doubt that he is a good QC. I do not know Michael Adams. The Commission has a contrary opinion from him. What do the Government's own advisers say?

The fact is that a principal legal officer, however able, is probably, by his own admission, not in the same class as Michael Adams, QC.

<PARA> I come back to the original point which has not been answered, that is, what legal advice, if any, did the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) have when it made its grant to Tranby College several months ago? Why was Tranby College selected, given the answer recently received by the Senate Estimates Committee about the nature and functions of Tranby College? No doubt the Minister is aware-if he is not, I think he ought to be-that there is very great concern in the Aboriginal communities around Australia that that grant to Tranby is a grant to the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations (NCAO), as the administrator of Tranby is also the convener of the Coalition. That was stated prior to the dinner break. Mr Pat Dodson, who is to chair the ADC Coordinating Committee on the Treaty consultations, is also a leader of the NCAO and there is a commonality of postal addresses. I do not believe that these matters have been addressed tonight. I think they are fundamental questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister to give me some explanation in respect of the unacquitted grants. Let me say for the record that I am not satisfied that the answer that the officers gave the Minister on the first occasion was a reflection of the truth. There is no ongoing program for the acquittal of grants. There has been a bungling mess and an absolute shambles in terms of unacquitted grants. The question I asked Senator Tate, as the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 25 November, was: how many unacquitted grants does the Department have presently outstanding nationally? That has nothing to do with 31 December, 1 January, or April Fools day. It is a close-off date which allows for a statistical answer. For reasons about which I can only speculate, and which the Department knows about, there has been a stalling of the answer. My guess is-and it is not an uninformed guess-that there has been a flurry in the Department in recent times to acquit the grants which have not so far been acquitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that at present there are about 2,000 unacquitted grants. I put to the Minister that there are associations and incorporated Aboriginal community bodies which are still attracting grants when they have unacquitted grants outstanding. I will wait for the Department to give the Minister further and better advice before I pursue my endeavours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest respect, let me say that the Department is either not providing the Minister with information or it is totally incompetent. I find it remarkable that a Government department, which was asked on 25 November what the status of unacquitted grants was, states on 1 December 1988 that it does not know. I assume that the number of unacquitted grants is not catalogued. Because I asked a question, I assume that the Department has some curiosity about the matter. Here we are, some five, six or seven days later, and the Department is in turmoil, trying to spew out figures which ought to be at hand. In some cases millions of dollars in single organisations are involved. The Minister is telling me that the Department cannot tell him whether these grants have been acquitted. It is a very simple, basic question, demanding and begging of a very simple and obvious answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked, for instance: Is it likely that, in the case of Western Australia as at September of this year, there were 769 unacquitted grants? Try that as a figure out of the air. Is the information available or is it not? Does the Minister have ongoing numbers or does he not? Is it unrealistic to imagine that the Department is capable of providing to itself and to its Minister, and to its Minister representing the Department in this chamber, the number at any given time? For instance, would it know, by looking at the Balgo Hills Aboriginal Community Incorporated profit and loss appropriation account as at 30 June 1987, whether the 1984-85 community development employment projects scheme grants of $483,684 is outstanding? Is it on the public record? The departmental officers have only got to do what I did and inquire through the Freedom of Information Act and pay out of their hard earned savings-which seems to amuse the departmental officers-and they will find the facts. But when I wrote to the Department and asked it for a refund of my money for getting information in the public interest, an officer wrote back and said he had carefully considered the grounds cited in support of my request; however, he considered that there were insufficient public interest grounds to remit the fees and charges levied. Is it fair that the Department can tell me that there are insufficient public interest grounds for refunding my money when I asked, in the public interest, whether grants were acquitted or unacquitted?</PARA>
<PARA> Weeks ago in this chamber I asked for an answer. Senator Richardson said, `Senator Crichton-Browne, I will give you an answer in a couple of days'. The very next day someone from Gerry Hand's office was on the phone sounding, I might say, very agitated. It just so happened that I had a prior commitment so I could not take his call, but I was available for the best part of the rest of the day. I have not heard from him since. I assume his moment of crisis passed. But I still do not know the answer and I still have not heard from Senator Richardson. In respect of the simple question to the Department about the number of unacquitted grants there is stunning silence. I find it remarkable that millions of dollars are outstanding and the Department cannot give me the answer. Surely the Department could have plucked out a couple of answers. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked seven simple questions. I asked: Are the Departmental officers sufficiently skilled to deal with the matter? I have been waiting seven days for an answer and I still have not got one. The Department does not know at this moment whether it has departmental officers sufficiently skilled to deal with the matter. I asked another simple question: What is the Government doing about these unacquitted grants? I would have thought that was a simple question. It could have said: We are doing something, or we are doing nothing, or we are taking valium, or we are having an Aspro and lying down, or we are working diligently in solving the problem. I have got no answer. I asked: Why has that occurred? I got no answer. The Department does not know why it has unacquitted grants going back for many years. It does not know why it is pumping taxpayers' funds into these organisations when they have already got unacquitted grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked another simple question-it ought to be like a drivers manual: Is the Department enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants? I cannot get an answer. Seven days later the Department does not know whether it is enforcing its financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants. What can this Department of Aboriginal Affairs tell us? If the officers do not know who the departmental head is I can understand their being confused, but I would have thought they would at least have known the normal procedures. I asked another simple question: Are grants still being made to organisations that presently have unacquitted grants? Is that difficult? Is that so complicated and confusing that the Department, which has a budget of billions of dollars and a thousand employees, cannot answer it? What is so devastating or penetrating and confusing that the Department cannot answer those simple and fundamental questions?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not imagine the Minister is very proud of that Department. It cannot answer simple questions. It cannot tell me whether my assessment of the Department having 2,200 unacquitted grants outstanding, as a ballpark figure, is right or wrong. I really do not know what the Department does know. Before I press on with the other matters, which will take me into the dark mire of confusion, perhaps the Minister could explain to me why any one of those seven questions has not been answered after seven days. </PARA>

As to the range of questions which Senator Crichton-Browne posed, I think quite properly I obviously took them, and the departmental officers have taken them, to be a composite question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the concern about the number of unacquitted grants was manifested late last year. So this in fact has not been a matter of special and unique-I think that was the term the honourable senator used-attention only over the last couple of months because of the furore surrounding the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that, human nature being what it is, knowing the scrutiny that the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio is under, I would expect State directors to respond very readily to the hounding, almost, that they are receiving in order to provide the acquittals. I cannot deny, obviously, that in the general atmosphere that has been created over the last couple of months there would be an added incentive to acquit these grants as speedily as possible and to meet the end of the calendar year deadline.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will leave that for another time. May I ask the Minister's view of the level of competence in terms of management and skill of the Department. The Minister should remember point 5 of my series of questions about what I understand to be a review of the departmental processes, particularly with respect to funding of major projects in the financial year 1987-88, including activities in the current financial year and a report that I understand was written by Mr Dunlevy and Mr Lyne of the Minister's Department. The findings were in respect of project control which goes to the very heart of the Department's capacity to protect the integrity and the careful spending of taxpayers' money. The findings of the project control were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a general breakdown of Project Control procedures with the following deficiencies being identified:</PARA>
<PARA> financial reports since December 1986 were not examined or an examination attempted. </PARA>
<PARA> other than audit reports, most periodical reports submitted by organisations were deficient in some aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Release of funds reports (C4's) were poorly prepared-some evidence of falsification of information existed. </PARA>
<PARA> Releases of capital funds in most cases were not properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Letters of Offer for the Supply Period 1987-88 didn't show evidence that they were signed by the delegated officer. </PARA>
<PARA> File copy was unsigned. </PARA>
<PARA> Releases were made without the prerequisite offer/acceptance letters in some cases, and many releases were made in August/September 87 without cover of offer/acceptance-advice was that a separate cover was to hand from State Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Audited financial statements relating to the 1986-87 financial year were not examined in most cases and consequently surpluses were not and still have not been adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA> Releases of funds were made in March 1988 without reference to the need to examine audit reports-this requirement was overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on I will raise the matter of the audit reports of a number of Aboriginal communities in Western Australia which impinge directly on that finding. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Many releases of funds that should have been made under delegation were not. </PARA>
<PARA> There was very little evidence on files that follow up action had been taken by officers to obtain outstanding information-financial returns, certificates, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Reporting</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The quality of financial reporting to the Region by most of the funded organisations is poor. Financial reports are not received on time and are usually deficient in some regard. Audit Reports as a consequence are heavily qualified. </PARA>
<PARA> For almost two years deficient financial reports have been tacitly accepted by the Regional Office. These reports were not examined and organisations not advised of shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA> The deficiencies identified were as follows:-</PARA>
<PARA> Many organisations presented consolidated Income and Expenditure or Receipts and Payments Statements that contained a variety of items not connected with DAA grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The most substantial item included in most cases was funds contributed by members. `Chuck in Money' which was expended on various items including many consumables-taxi fares, beverages, travel and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the existence of these items the identification of expenditure against funds was extremely difficult if not impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of financial reports, i.e. to identify the cash situation of organisations and to monitor grants could not be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> All periodical reporting requirements were rarely received and those deficiencies were not pointed out to the organisation concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> A letter has been prepared for dispatch to organisations . . . outlining accounting requirements, however, it is likely that in many cases this will not be understood by the recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of block grants--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, when Senator Crichton-Browne commenced reading the report, I missed who was the author or the authors.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forgive me. I understand that the report was prepared by the Department in Western Australia and related generally to the status of grants, their management, disbursement and accountability in Aboriginal communities in Western Australia. Let us look at block grants. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the poor reporting record of most funded organisations they continue to be placed on block grants and/or six monthly reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that block funding and the relaxation of financial reporting is generally reserved for organisations with good records of accountability and demonstrated sound managerial ability. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that was reasonable. In terms of the release of funds forms-that is the C4 forms-the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>As outlined above, these forms were poorly addressed by Regional staff. In many cases the information presented was incorrect or false. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the word `false' comes from. One can understand the word `incompetent' but the word `false' surely leads us in another direction. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Checks made reveal several instances of forms conveying information that was not supported by evidence on files and in some cases evidence existed that forms were knowingly falsified. </PARA>
<PARA> The impression gained was that the release of funds was paramount and that control mechanisms were knowingly overridden in order to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The major deficiencies noted were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> * Widespread statements in the form C4s that reports were to hand had been examined and that deficiencies were noted and being followed up when the reports had not been received, or were received but not examined. </PARA>
<PARA> * Cases existed where reports for periods were said to have been received and examined when the reports in question were not required, sought, or indeed received, or ever likely to be received. </PARA>
<PARA> * Statements in the C4s that the necessary quotes/tender arrangements had been complied with when they had not. In some cases quotes/tenders were obtained after the release of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> * Quotes sometimes beyond their usual validity periods (in other words, old quotes) were used for convenience to facilitate the release of capital funds. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what it says about grant acquittals:</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the visit the total of unacquitted grants for the Region was 151 grants. </PARA>
<PARA>Everyone else seems to know the number of unacquitted grants except the officers who are here advising us tonight. The authors of the report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Steps were taken while in Derby to accelerate the acquittance of grants where possible. This took the form of Mr Dunlevy acquainting the project officer concerned with unresolved issues that hindered the acquittance of the grant concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> With the assistance of the project officer concerned matters were resolved where possible or steps taken towards the resolution of outstanding matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so the report goes on. I conclude this part of my argument by saying that the report alleges that likewise there are a number of other projects which did not come under the jurisdiction of any particular project officer at the time and headway with these was not possible. I ask the Minister to comment on this quote from the report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the deficiencies noted in the course of the file review, it is necessary to acknowledge that a major breakdown has occurred and that steps will be taken to ensure that grant administration will be normalised immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little value at this stage of the Department's life to attempt to rectify the lapses that have occurred, as such an attempt would deplete the resources available for the current, ongoing, day to day operations of the Department and the Region. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the inability of the Department to advise the Minister of what I would describe as very elementary questions, which should be contained within the files in an ongoing capacity, is the Minister satisfied with what he understands to be the performance of the Department so far? Does he accept that it should take two weeks for unacquitted grants to be provided to him? Does he think a department should have on its computer process, which cost millions of dollars, a simple mechanism where a button could be pressed to show the position of Ombulgurri or Kalumburu or Balgo or Marra Worra Worra or Junjuwa or any other Aboriginal community one likes to name? It is elementary that that information should be available, and I would have thought that most enterprises would know to whom they had given money, whether it had been accounted for, whether it had been repaid, whether it was still outstanding, who owed money, why it was owed and who was incompetent. Yet we have millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers' money somewhere rotating, floating and circulating out there which no one can quite get a handle on. The Department does not seem to know who has got what money, where it is going, what it is for and what it is supposed to do. </PARA>

Yes, you are right, we have been incompetent, indolent, inefficient and our attempts have been futile but mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, we are on the way to recovery', I would buy it. But for the Minister to try to stonewall me and say that he does not know but is trying to work out the mess he has got himself into is far from satisfactory. Perhaps the Minister could give me his reflection, his enlightened views, on the information with which I have provided him, which no doubt is at the fingertips of his Department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the question of the administration of the portfolio and the various programs within it, honourable senators will be aware of the sorts of matters which gave rise to the various inquiries instituted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) which are now under way. I expect that the sort of review of these programs being undertaken by the Public Service Commission, the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance, and in an overall way by Mr Andrew Menzies, will enable us to form a more considered view as to the general level of administrative skills possessed within the Department, and as to the competence and probity of the officers concerned in the administration of these programs. The Government, without making any assumptions, awaits those reports. We will then have an overall picture which will enable any steps that are required to be taken on the basis of most expert advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the particular document, which Senator Crichton-Browne says is a document provided from within the departmental office in Western Australia, obviously I am not conversant with it. None of the officers present in the chamber assisting is conversant with that document. Therefore, I am unable to comment on the assertions of fact and the allegations as to maladministration which are made in it. Nevertheless, it is a matter for concern, and if it is a departmental report for the benefit of the administrators of the programs in Western Australia, then I imagine that the matter, having been so carefully defined and assessed, was handled by way of preliminary to concerted action being taken to remedy the situation. One imagines that a report is not made in order to vent some sort of spleen, but to base a more stringent approach to the problems which are revealed. I hope that that is the purpose of the report. It is not one which the central office has in its possession. </PARA>

An application was granted to Stephen Hawke for the purpose of writing a book on the events of Noonkanbah for the period 1979-80, involving an amount of $22,255.20.

It is quite unlikely that they would know, and they do not know. We have to be clear as to the function of the Committee of the Whole in relation to Senate Estimates committees. As I understand it, it is the subject of a report which is suggesting a more streamlined approach to the way in which the Committee of the Whole receives Estimates committee reports. The information sought in the kind of detailed question which the honourable senator just posed is obviously within the knowledge of regional officers of the Department and the question could well be raised at Estimates committee hearings or, through the Estimates committee secretariat, put to officers in the Department or the Aboriginal Development Commission. I am sure that they would have been able to have provided an answer for the honourable senator tonight. But it is quite impossible, and I do not think it advances any thesis to make it apparent, for officers here tonight to answer that sort of question. It is just too detailed, as they do not have available to them matters which are clearly on the files of regional directors.</PARA></TALK.START>

They obviously do not have that information and cannot help the honourable senator.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me talk in a more global sense in terms of principles to see whether we can reach some sort of resolution. Let me deal with some general areas of principal; that is, the accountability, the control and the management of funds in respect of various organisations and the role the Minister sees the Department having in the assistance it provides to Aboriginal communities to ensure that they have competent, capable and dedicated officers with certain levels of integrity. Let me ask the Minister about Oombulgurri, which the Minister discussed with me at the same stage last year, where $200,000 was lost to the community when the bookkeeper disappeared with the books and the money. The Minister's answer to me last year was that he thought that the Australian Federal Police were investigating the matter and his Department was examining the books to see what could be done about it. My understanding is that, since then, the officer has been found and, in some obscure way-I ask the Minister to forgive me for not knowing any more than that, but it seems to be a big leap forward in terms of what the Department knows-has now been paid $35,000 in compensation. Yet my fleeting examination of the auditor's report of Oombulgurri shows me that the accountability has not improved and the standard of bookkeeping have not improved. Perhaps the Minister can explain to me why, concerning the period to 30 June 1987, the auditor states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the first few months of the year ended June 30 1987 the internal controls over cash payments were not sufficient to ensure that all payments were made for bona fide community purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> A list of payments made for which we could find no supporting documentation whatsoever . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The internal controls surrounding the cash float system were not adequate to ensure that all outgoings could be accounted for or that transactions were correctly recorded. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go through that report in detail, or the Balgo report, or the Kalumburu report-which I have personally asked Senator Tate about before-or the rest. I simply ask him to explain to me why that man received $30,000, $35,000 or $40,000-I am not certain about the total-in compensation. Last year Senator Tate told me that the Department was looking for him to retrieve the money. Having had this matter brought to his Department's attention, and his being advised of it, his Department was well aware of the deficiencies in bookkeeping in that organisation. Why have we had an audit report since then which shows that these defects have not been rectified?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not believe that and I do not believe it is the attitude of the Department. There is a real necessity to ensure that moneys which are provided for Aboriginal communities, for the advancement of Aboriginal people, or paid to some Aboriginal organisation, are used for their intended purposes. Accounting is required for that. The sort of reporting and the sort of acquittal that we have been speaking about for the last hour is a means by which the Department checks that the moneys which it pays out are paid out with no thought as to their devotion to the purposes for which they were provided. There are mechanisms in place to try to ensure that those purposes are indeed fulfilled by the expenditure of those moneys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I have also pointed out that there are programs intended to build up management expertise and skills in bookkeeping within Aboriginal organisations. Indeed, there is quite a large program. We have discussed the Aboriginal organisation training program, which is directed to trying to provide Aboriginal organisations with those sorts of skills. Obviously it is not straightforward or easy to achieve, in a short space of time. But it is one of the programs being undertaken in order to ensure that within Aboriginal organisations there is proper accounting of the moneys provided. It is quite clear from this Government's attitude that money should be acquitted and properly accounted for. One would hope that the review by the Department of Finance, by the Public Service Commissioner and by the Auditor-General will perhaps better focus on such matters as need to be undertaken in order to ensure that the management of those funds is as stringent as possible. I have just received a note that the training under the Aboriginal organisation training program involves an expenditure of some $3.5m per year. In so far as that expenditure provides for the training of persons within Aboriginal organisations, it may be seen to be a very good investment if, indeed, it leads to a situation where persons can undertake the bookkeeping and the acquittal which is of such concern. </PARA>

There are obviously any number of reasons for the failure of those particular grants to be acquitted over a period of time. It is a responsibility, obviously, of the organisation concerned to provide the report and material which enables the grant to be properly acquitted. I do not know offhand whether the skills of management which Mr Wyatt possesses were brought to bear in a way which enabled that situation to linger and fester.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I move on I must say that I find the Minister's answer quite remarkable. I understand that this is not his Department and that he is carrying a load of lead for somebody else-Mr Hand. I find it absolutely stunningly remarkable that he would proffer to this chamber the opinion on whether Mr Wyatt is the appropriate person to administer the Aboriginal Development Commission on the basis of saying, when I asked him about the unacquitted grants, that it depends upon his attitude to these unacquitted grants. What is his role? What is his responsibility? I do not want to drag this out tonight, but what is the function of the head of a region, of a State, of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA)? Is he required to have some knowledge of the outstanding grants? Is he expected to know what grants have been acquitted and what grants have been unacquitted? Is that part of his functions? Is that part of his responsibility? Is that part of his duty, or is it, as the Minister says, a matter for the organisation concerned? Is it a matter of concern for the organisations of Oombulgurri or Kalumburu that they have unacquitted grants of a couple of million dollars of taxpayers' funds, and that it is only their problem-that is not the Minister's problem, it is not the taxpayers' problem, it is not the departmental head's problem? Whose problem is it? I find it remarkable that the Minister would say to me that it is not Mr Wyatt's problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister said that it depends on Mr Wyatt's attitude towards it. If there are 800 unacquitted grants in Western Australia, hypothetically, surely that is his responsibility. Tens of millions worth of dollars are involved in those unacquitted grants. At the end of the day, the responsibility for the approval of those grants-in some respects the administration and in all respects the acquittal-rests with him. It is not good enough to say that the Aboriginal community at Noonkanbah is exclusively responsible. The Minister knows that most of the leaders of those Aboriginal communities are unable to read or write, least of all count. In many cases they barely speak English. Yet the Minister puts it to me-to use his expression-that it is the responsibility of the organisation concerned. That is why I asked Senator Tate what he sees is the responsibility of the Department in respect of the various officers appointed. I understand what self-determination means in the minds of some and I do not know what it means in the minds of others. I certainly do not know what it means in the mind of the Department. Does it mean that it has the exclusive right to hire and fire who it likes and, at the end of the day, if millions of dollars goes astray, so be it? Is that what self-determination means?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer the Minister to the Wangkatjungka auditor's report. I have raised this man's name before and I regret that it could give the impression that I am concerned about him. I am concerned about a principle. I refer to a Mr Peter Ross, who was still on the payroll of one of the organisations. The auditor's report referred to the fact that Mr Ross was `booking up personal motor expenses to the association when he visited Derby. The association paid for two charter flights to and from Derby on 2 May 1985 and 18 February 1986 carrying Mr Ross'. There is no indication that that was on behalf of the organisation. The expense items, stores purchased, included various expenditures which did not relate to stores purchased. They included food items used by Mr Ross in entertaining visiting officials and personal items for Mr Ross, which Mr Ross maintained should have been deducted from his wages by the Marra Worra Worra Association but were not deducted. The only problem is that there was never any authorisation given to Marra Worra Worra. There were items for supplies for home maintenance and items of equipment for the projects officer's house-that is, Mr Ross's house-and 34 cartons of beer which Mr Ross informed the auditor were used to entertain visiting officials. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who would complain that Mr Ross has an unfortunate but long history of misplacing organisations' and taxpayers' funds. There have been complaints that he has misappropriated pension cheques. It is a well known fact that in the Fitzroy Crossing area Mr Ross used to go to the local pub in anticipation of the pension cheques coming in and getting $8,000 or $10,000 of hot cash in his hot little hand. Then he would dole it out like a benevolent Father Christmas. When the cheques came in, he would cash them and pay back the pub. Nobody ever knew whether Mr Ross stashed half the money in his pocket, down his pants, in his boots, or what happened. There was no accountability. By way of example, Mr Ross went to Christmas Creek. In 1985 Christmas Creek brought a brand new Toyota Hi-Lux. It arrived at Derby for pick up. The Wangkatjungka community authorised two senior members of the community to take custody of the vehicle. One was Jimmy Angie and the other was Sandowner Elliot. But Mr Ross interfered and two young men of doubtful reputation went across to pick the vehicle up. One, Marty Stevens was well known in the area. Instead of picking it up in Derby and taking it back to Wangkatjangka they decided they would go to the rodeo in Broome. They got 170 kilometres south in this brand spanking new vehicle and rolled it over. It was written off and sold to the wreckers for $3,500. That was the Wangkatjangka's one and only source of transport. That was Mr Ross's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> At about the same time a Mr Joe Tramata was appointed to the local school. There had been a resolution by the local community that the community school would be kept quite separate and autonomous from the affairs of the community. Mr Ross got there and in five minutes rounded up the Aboriginal community, passed his own resolutions and caused havoc in the school. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This man is a white, yes. There have been complaints about him. Time is against me. I have letters here written to the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Clyde Holding, from the Chairman of the Marra Worra Worra Association of Fitzroy Crossing. I have a letter here to Clyde Holding, from Johnny Watson, Chairman of the Kimberley Land Council. Both letters complain about this man in clear and precise detail. They even say that when he was lobbying for the job he bribed the Aboriginal community with motor cars and rifles. The Department first of all ignored the allegations, then, if my memory serves me correctly, wrote back and said that it was none of their business. That is why I bring these matters before the Minister. I do not raise them for the sake of airing bad linen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Ross worked for the Junjuwah Association. He is a justice of the peace. He threatened several Aboriginal people with physical violence. On one occasion the Junjuwah people called a meeting for his dismissal. He walked in and offered one of the senior elders, Mr Adam Andrews, a motor car. He gave him the key and said, `That's what I can do for you as long as I am running your organisation'. He gave a DAA car away-a taxpayers' car-to keep his job. I do not want to go on and on and on. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray ought not provoke me. Mr Ross got involved in Marra Worra Worra recently. He called a meeting. He rounded up all the members of the Aboriginal community he could lay his hands on, threatened, intimidated and stood over them, and got them to sack the bookkeepers. I will give the Department credit: it at least went to examine the books and found them not wanting and the bookkeeper to be a person of good repute, I understand. But by then Mr Ross had caused all the trouble he wanted to cause. The auditors observed:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are of the opinion that Mr Ross should not have become directly involved in the affairs of Marra Worra Worra. He is not of Aboriginal descent. He is not a member of Marra Worra Worra staff and his actions concerning Marra Worra Worra could be attributable in part to personal motives. </PARA>
<PARA>That same Mr Ross is presently employed by Junjuwah in the same town. I ask the question: What responsibility does the Minister see the Department having to deal with these problems which he must know are beyond the competence, capacity and ability of these Aboriginal communities to deal with personally? It seems that the Department continues to wash its hands of matters on every occasion. One on occasion the Marra Worra Worra community complained about the local regional officer, a Mr Hunter if my memory serves me correctly. The community complained first that he interfered and insisted that it employ people. One such person stole $5,000 and disappeared to the eastern States. He also chose to drive the community's vehicle from Perth to Marra Worra Worra without the community's authority. He rolled the vehicle over on the way and the community never saw it. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: What does the Department judge on balance to be its responsibility in ensuring the preservation of the integrity of these organisations and their funds and their functions? Or does it wash its hands and say, `It has nothing to do with us. They are autonomous organisations. We concern ourselves not with the employees; we concern ourselves not with the funds; we concern ourselves not with the audit reports; we concern ourselves not with whether they are achieving the objectives, the goals, the ambitions and perhaps the desires and aspirations that they have for themselves?' Does it just write them off? Does it just keep feeding money into them or does it think it has some intrinsic responsibility towards them? Does it try to manifest that responsibility in some way through the white advisers, the white community employees, the white officers of the Department who presumably are there to help and assist; not hinder, not manipulate, not in any way seek for their own agenda to cause the problems that are flowing right through Australia now, causing the divisions and divisiveness that the Government claims is the responsibility of this side of politics?</PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be no care, no regard, no passion by the Department, nor its officers and, least of all, the Ministers for the plight of these people and it gets worse. Every year when I look at the audit reports of these communities I find more money lost, misappropriated, stolen or just plain disappeared, and the response I get on every occasion is, `We do not know the answer; we will look at it; it is a matter of regional consequence that we cannot concern ourselves about'. Surely at the end of the day, it makes up the broader canvass and fulfils the larger picture. Surely the department has a responsibility. Surely it sees itself as having to ensure, in the balance of self-determination, in the balance of responsibilities resting with the local community, some counterbalance so that these people, at the end of the day, do not suffer as a result of the lack of endeavour or concern or contribution by the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as an ordinary backbencher whose main function in this place is to maintain a quorum, it seems, but at the same time I also rise as the Chairman of the Estimates Committee that dealt with these issues relating to Aboriginal affairs for about two weeks. From my memory there were 2,000 questions or more on notice. There was a significant period of questioning, probably more than on any other committee I have been associated with, in relation to Aboriginal affairs. A number of Liberal, National Party and Democrat senators turned up to those Estimates hearings, as did the press, as did pretty well everyone in Australia by the time the press had finished with reporting those Estimates hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not see Senator Crichton-Browne at any of those hearings. I did not see written questions on notice that could have been handed in to the Committee. I did not see the sort of detail that the honourable senator is raising tonight raised during those hearings. I did hear, for example, accusations about black mafia corruption and so on in Aboriginal affairs being brought forward by Senator Tambling, who at least had the courage to sit through all the hearings, who at least had the courage to put his name to a report, and who at least had the time to stand up and be counted in that particular issue, similarly with Senator Short. Tonight I have heard that process taken a step further. Senator Crichton-Browne stood up in this place and established himself as judge, jury and executioner of people's reputations. I do not know Mr Ross from Adam, nor Adam Smith, which was another name raised by Senator Crichton-Browne, but I have a personal view about what we ought to be doing in this chamber about people's reputations. It is my view that there are other jurisdictions to accuse, try and sentence people for crimes or misdemeanours which are not accepted by the community, which are considered to be criminal offences. </PARA>

I understand that, because of staff reductions within the Department, tests of the effectiveness of some drugs have for some time been operating at reduced levels. As a result, serious backlogs have developed in the area. I understand that the supply of some fertility hormone used to treat infertile women was not tested for nine months after it had been used in the program.

There are some delays in the testing of drugs and there are a number of reasons for the delays.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but I am not quite clear what that means. Did the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) say that does occur sometimes, or did he say that he has no knowledge of it occurring? It is a very serious matter. I can imagine that the infertile women who were tested with the hormone that was found to be inactive would be rather upset by it. Is the delay due to staff cuts or because of the backlog in the testing? They are pretty basic questions. As I say, I was unable to ask them during the Estimates Committee hearing. I asked Mr Roche particularly about the staff cuts and the effects of the staff cuts. I want to find out if this backlog has caused the problems we see.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are some delays due to testing procedures that have been embarked on, and there are delays for other reasons.

So I say categorically that my advice is that the staff cuts themselves have not contributed to the delay in the valuation procedures. The delay in the valuation procedures has been caused by other reasons. Since the honourable senator has asked for precise information, might I say with due respect that this is a question she could have pursued at the Committee. We did, I think, provide ample scope for pursuit of specific questions when the officers were all in attendance. I cannot now pluck figures out of the air to answer the question.

Senator Cook has told me that there is a backlog of 15 months, that that has nothing to do with staff cuts, that it was there before the additional staff cuts were made. He says the staff cuts have been only minor. I asked Mr Roche whether in the therapeutic division there had been any staff cuts and he said, `I do not think there have been reductions in staff'. He then gave us a table and in that period said that there were reductions in staff. Senator Cook told me that there was a 15 months backlog prior to the staff cuts. He then cut staff, but he says that the backlog had nothing to do with staff cuts. I would have thought it was pretty obvious that if one wanted to lessen the period of the backlog then one certainly would not have made any cuts but would have increased the number of staff.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can I say to the first part of the honourable senator's statement that if my colleagues were interjecting it is not my responsibility to maintain decorum in this chamber. I do not think it is reasonable to say, nor do I accept any challenge from the honourable senator, with due respect, that things will be held up if I do not maintain decorum in this chamber. That is the responsibility of the Chairman, who is doing an excellent job, might I say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the staff question which the honourable senator has raised, I advised her a moment ago that I was not able to specify the particular figures but I thought that the staff cuts were minor. Let me now correct that advice because I have in front of me a table which is in the Hansard of Estimates Committee F, page F70. This is the hearing on 13 October and the table is one submitted by the Department of Community Services and Health and is headed `Staffing by Function'. In the function column against No. 5, Therapeutics, the 1987-88 usage's figure, that is, the staff deployed by the department under that heading, was 325.7. I feel sorry for the 0.7 of a person! The estimated target for 1988-89 is in fact an increase, it is not a decrease, and I correct that general comment that I made earlier. It is 328 staff, and that is also true for 1989-90. The estimate for 1989-90 is also 328 staff. </PARA>

If I were to give the honourable senator the particular answer it would be yes. But it is explained by reference to the general practice that the staff establishment levels are usually above what are the practical levels, and the Department reserves the right, of course, to recruit for diversity of particular staff for particular jobs. That does not always mean to say that the staff levels are at the cited establishment level. My understanding is that it is common for them to be below that level.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have questions on two matters. My first set of questions concerns the administration of section 19 (5) of the Health Insurance Act and the Health Insurance Commission's interpretation of it. I would like to discuss briefly whether there is any discernible movement from the Government away from the rather rigid, narrow interpretation of health screening or, as it is otherwise referred to, ortho-molecular medicine. I understand that this is defined in a bulletin MB234 which currently prevails and which spells out the interpretation because this is fairly significant to appropriations and the dollars that are available to address new challenges in social medicine. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) is obviously aware of my interest in this from questions I have posed over a period of 15 months. It is apparent that with the thrust into preventative medicine, which is now being enunciated in medical schools and spelled out in medical policy, there is an inherent contradiction between the requirements in the community and the interpretation and specifications in legislation. I am simply citing the fact that quite divergent and contradictory positions are being adopted by the Government towards the needs of the profession and the community. This is affecting doctors dramatically; in other words, those doctors who are attempting to practise preventative medicine, which is defined in the documents I have referred to as ortho-molecular medicine, are being frustrated in those attempts and the patients whom they are servicing are being denied their entitlements under the promises of the Health Insurance Act. We are simply requesting the Government to address this contradiction. Has the Government addressed it in the appropriations?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I particularly draw the Minister's attention once again, but only briefly on this occasion, to the evidence of this contradiction that is apparent in my own community of the central coast and which is being substantiated by findings in the United States suggesting that we are on the forward edge of a major social medical problem which will simply be frustrated by this apparent contradiction of position. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that a number of very sincere and genuine medical practitioners have attempted to test this legal position. A number of patients have even been advised that they will have to test it in the High Court of Australia to get their Medicare claim substantiated. I will put a sharper edge on it by saying that of the 96 people whose blood samples have been tested in the United States-I have passed the findings from those tests to Senator Cook and to Minister Blewett in the last 48 hours; I think they were known to the Ministers from other sources anyway-not one has had a Medicare claim honoured. I simply suggest that it is unacceptable, and it should be unacceptable to the Government, that people who walk through the door of a bona fide medical practitioner's office in this country, and incur a medical cost-in some cases in the order of $700 or $800-should find themselves later being served with a summons. I have gone with them to seek legal advice at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre where they have been told to take their Medicare claims to the High Court of Australia. Yet the same 96 people are ill. The evidence of their blood samples is that there could be toxicity levels in their blood 20 times those which are found in the United States. Yet as a result of the present interpretation of that section of the Act, as it is being rigidly adhered to and not moved from as medical teaching and philosophy and social requirements would suggest, they are being told to go to the High Court of Australia to have their Medicare claims honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put this matter to the Minister previously in questions. I also put it to him exactly a year ago in the last appropriations debate. I raised precisely the same issue. I know the history of this philosophical issue; it has been spelt out to me that it has evolved over a period of six years. I am simply saying that the time has arrived for a shift to occur. Medical skills are telling the Government that; genuine practitioners are trying to put into effect the philosophy that is inherent in the Government's own policies. I urge the Minister to advise the bureaucrats who are administering and interpreting the legislation on his behalf that the time has come to shift and to honour the Medicare claims of these 96 people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take that as a general question from Senator McLean. Two questions on this subject have been raised-one by him and one by Senator Haines-in Question Time over the last nine months. I cannot actually recall when Senator McLean raised this matter, but I recall that in my formal answer, given after the question was originally raised on notice, I put to him that, if there was particular evidence that the Department of Community Services and Health should consider when dealing with this matter, he should bring this forward. I have not been advised that this has been done. I know that Senator McLean has referred to tests in the United States and so on, but I do not have a reference for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the best way to deal with this is for me to extend to Senator McLean an invitation to meet officials from the Department and go through the particular evidence that he has to see whether we disagree on the basis of an interpretation which can be resolved by discussion, or whether we disagree over a major matter of principle. It could be that we disagree over a matter of principle in terms of what is entitled to be claimed on the Medicare schedule and whether the types of services being rendered are services of a paramedical nature which are not claimable under that schedule. I do not want to judge this matter, however, and I extend to Senator McLean the invitation to meet departmental officials, go through the particular cases and clean them up. That may be a much more expeditious way of dealing with the matter. I certainly do not think that bald advice to people to go to the High Court is a satisfactory way of dealing with it. The course I have suggested might prove to be the avenue to settle this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Invariably, if people approach, ask and seek they get the bureaucratic answer that the Health Insurance Act does not allow this. We are saying that the Act should be changed, that the interpretation of it should be changed. The time has come, professionally, in terms of government policy and in terms of honouring claims to change the Act or its interpretation. I have sent this evidence to the offices of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in the last 48 hours. Dr Donahue, who is the doctor in question, has virtually had his practice closed down. Some of the pathologists he used have had their practices closed down. Some have gone bankrupt because for the last two years they have been pursuing the need for shift. There is a need for shift away, but as soon as they ask the question again they are given the same answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Resources to read the Hansard report of the last appropriations debate when I addressed precisely the same questions and was told that the Minister would take the questions on notice. She did, she eventually responded and I received the classic answer-namely, that it is interpreted as health screening and that there has been no shift from the position of ortho-molecular medicine. I am saying that the time has come to shift. The time has come to see that pathology is at the centre of social medicine. Patients of doctors who were trying to apply the new medicine which they had been taught in progressive medical schools-and I refer to my son who is a graduate of a progressive medical school at Newcastle-are being told not to go to those people because their claims will not be honoured. They are told that if they contest it, they will have to go to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tells me to give him the evidence. I have already given it to him. He also asks me to sit and talk with him. I have tried to do that as a senator by asking questions on notice, questions without notice, by making representations to the Minister for Community Services and Health, by standing in this chamber a year ago and entering into an appropriations debate on the issue. I have stood up on every possible occasion and said, `The time has come to change'. Yet the Minister tells me yet again to enter into further discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am now advised that within the last 48 hours Senator McLean provided information to my office. The honourable senator's question was several months ago, when we invited him to provide the information. I do not think it is reasonable now for the honourable senator to come into the chamber and say, `You have had it in the last two days, and why have I not had an answer?'. This is a matter requiring more detail and a more complicated response to the types of material Senator McLean has produced than is reasonable to expect in these circumstances. However, I am grateful for the honourable senator's reply to my answer and to my invitation. It has now identified clearly that the purpose of Senator McLean's question is to change the Act. Perhaps we would have saved ourselves a lot of time had the point been made specifically from the outset that it was desired to change the very Act under which Medicare operates. The Government needs to keep a clear check on what types of medical procedures are to be met under the Medicare table. Doctors may go to what Senator McLean has called a progressive medical school to practise medicine that is not recognised under the Medicare table--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that there are thousands, but I accept the number put forward in the honourable senator's interjection. It is another matter to get these procedures accepted on the Medicare table. In terms of the Medicare table, services provided by medical practitioners, consultations by optometrists and certain dental procedures are accepted on the Medicare table. The Government has said that it has no intention of extending fee for service Medicare benefits to the services of any other health practitioners. The question whether Medicare arrangements should be expanded to provide benefits for certain paramedical and alternative medicine services was addressed in June 1986 in the second report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee, the Layton Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Committee was established by the Government specifically to consider, amongst other things, whether benefits should be provided for certain of the types of services to which the honourable senator has referred. The Committee was not prepared to recommend an extension of the Medicare arrangements to cover, on a fee for service basis, the service of any modality of health occupation which is not already included in the arrangements. A major factor in that Committee's decision at the time was its finding that no modality could control service levels. Although the Layton Committee considered that certain paramedical services should attract additional public funding on other than a fee for service basis, these did not include the services of naturopaths. Natural therapy was not proposed for public funding because the Layton Committee was not satisfied that it was an effective modality, nor that it had established standards of training and practice. That is the finding of the Layton Committee. I am sure that that finding is known to the honourable senator and that this is not the first time the explanation I have given him has been visited on him. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I renew the offer. If the honourable senator wants to change the Act, the definition and the way in which these things are designed as being acceptable medical services for the purposes of the Medicare table, that is a matter of substance. It is not a matter of the administration of the Act; thus it is not a matter that goes to the proper regulation and control of the Department and whether applications for Medicare payments are being properly met. It goes to the very basis of what constitutes an entitlement and what does not. I suggest that that is a matter of policy. I should widen my invitation and take the name in vain of the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, whom I represent in this chamber, and suggest that he and I would both be prepared to meet with the honourable senator to discuss whether it is appropriate to change the Act, as he has put it. But one would have to see that invitation, as I freely give, it, against the background and in the context of how we have dealt with these things in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make several points before I move on briefly to my second area of interest in relation to these appropriations. I attempted one year ago to make it very clear that the intention was to change the Act and that the time had arrived to accommodate a shift in philosophy, practice and policy. I made that perfectly clear at the beginning of my entry into this debate 15 months ago. I think it is important to distinguish between two sets of questions that I have asked over those 15 months. The first set of questions related to a series of doctors in practice and the frustrations that they were experiencing. Those doctors had been visited by officers of the Health Insurance Commission; the profiles of their practices had been investigated; their records had been removed from their offices; and the circumstances and the manner in which they were administering and practising their medicine had been thoroughly investigated. There has been no lack of evidence there. My recent questions have related quite specifically to a study being undertaken of the toxicity in the blood taken from people in eastern seaboard communities. So two sets of questions have been pursued over the last 15 months by me and those who have supported me.</PARA></TALK.START>

The remainder of the tabled documents are as follows: a document being a ministerial submission dated the end of August with a note attached dated 15 September; a note from Mr MacDonald dated 22 September; a note from Mr MacDonald dated 13 October; a note from-I cannot read the name but I believe it is Ms Humes-dated 18 October; an internal minute or note for file; and a typewritten note dated 1 December 1988, being today, recalling a conversation and discussion which took place on 8 November and signed by the officers who were present at that meeting with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I therefore table those documents which relate to the decision making, deliberation and consideration of funding for the National Aboriginal Islander Health Organisation. When those documents are perused it will become abundantly clear that the minutes of the senior officers' meeting were not correct in so far as they indicated that the Minister had approved funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. Indeed, he has still to make that decision. That becomes clear as the documents are read. The Minister is still considering the auditor's report which was asked to be tabled. Obviously that falls into a different category to these internal documents. I table these documents in accordance with the resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to be brief although I think that I am once again raising a very substantive question. I have been approached by a number of nursing homes which have raised with me what I am told is called the care aggregate module (CAM) which is the formula under which it is determined how much money nursing homes will now get and what they can deliver to the community. I am advised that CAM is dependent upon what is called the resident classification formula and that this has changed. This change in the formula means that the application of the care aggregate module has, to put it bluntly, disseminated the finances of nursing homes and that they are having to readjust their services dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Scone District Nursing Home, which I visited fairly recently, is having to close down the only district day care centre within the northern Hunter region. I am told by Peninsula Homes for the Aged Ltd in the Woy Woy-Umina peninsula area that it is having to revise the funding of its service dramatically. I am told that it is typical of what is happening to the financing of nursing homes across the country. I have received fairly strong representations, long explanations and cogent arguments from the staff of the Scone District Nursing Home. They suggest that we plead with the Department to analyse the effect of the revision to the resident classification formula as it is being administered through the care aggregate module and the impact that it is having on the funds that are available to those attempting to service nursing homes needs. </PARA>
<PARA> To put a political edge on it, the Government has become sensitive to the dimensions of grey power. It has been suggested to me that those who came out in their thousands from places such as the Sydney Town Hall about six weeks ago and demonstrated the extraordinary potential impact of grey power were the healthy aged. The people I am referring to are the frail aged, the ones who can barely move in bed. </PARA>

I suggest that the formulas being applied by the Government in relation to the aged in our community, whether they be frail and in bed, whether they be healthy and on their feet and able to attend public meetings at the Sydney Town Hall or whether they be veterans of the Returned Services League, are in fact pretty crude these days, and they are being interpreted that way. I put a political edge on the argument which, in terms of the submissions from nursing homes that I have in front of me, is very real; they are having grave difficulty in sustaining the services that they are delivering to communities across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLean is completely right. He is talking about the resident classification instrument that is being used by the Government today to reduce the number of people who qualify for the top health benefits when they are long term sick in nursing homes. It goes so far as to make people, who have had bilateral strokes and are blind, ineligible for the top rate of nursing home cover in nursing homes. In fact, it is such a severe restriction on the number of people who qualify for top rebate care in nursing homes that it will cause many nursing homes and hostels in Australia to restrict their services-I do not whether to say that they will go broke-until such time as the Government comes to its senses and rectifies that dreadful and restrictive anomaly in Medicare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the point that Senator Sheil and I were developing a few moments ago; that is, the impact of the resident classification instrument upon the flow of funds to those who are rendering nursing care in Australian communities. They argue that the instrument is inappropriate and illogical. Let me cite one specific example: the case of elderly, frail, demented people who are bedridden. They receive a high classification and therefore attract dollars to the nursing home. Those who are mobile and therefore substantially disrupt the service that can be rendered to others within the nursing home attract, under this instrument, a low level of funding. Those administering the hospitals and nursing homes argue that it is an irrational formula. That is only one area in which they cite its irrationality. They say the end effect of this-fewer dollars-will be to cut back on staff and to cut back on services, not to reduce the number of people in the nursing home. Eventually this will substantially negate the very process that they so vitally represent in the community. The long and short of it is that I ask the Minister to guide the Department towards a review of the resident classification instrument as it is being administered through the care aggregate module and to take into account the impact it is having on the level of funding.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Department has estimated that with a change away from a submissions-based assessment to an assessment based on the needs of the residents, the increase would have been about 0.9 of an hour per patient on average. Therefore, claims that some or all are suffering great hardship do not seem to us to be true. The Department advises me that it is monitoring the situation. Senator McLean has asked us to look harder and closer. That is a fair request. We will certainly do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be Senator McLean's request but it is certainly not my request. For nearly two months I have been involved with nursing homes and hostels to a considerable degree, discussing this classification of patients which is reducing the income of nursing homes and hostels. They will be in dire straits and will have to reduce the amount of nursing to the patients. This is the problem. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Department will monitor the problem that the Government has caused. The problem is real, it is on the ground, and it affects people in nursing homes and hostels now. It is inappropriate for the Minister to say that he will look at the problem.

It is part of the whole attack on the health system, but this time the Government is attacking the old, the disabled and the people who need care and are incapable of looking after themselves. Those people cannot earn any more money and are dependent on the Government, and the Government has cut down by a severe classification of what it will pay for in these institutions. It is no good monitoring the situation. The problem is there now and I would like the Minister to say something about solving that problem. These people are in extreme difficulties right now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have three issues that I would like to raise briefly. One is that, when the arrangements were made for nursing home funding and to introduce the five categories, I referred in my speech-I do not believe I have had any answer to the issue I raised-to the document which outlined the research into the development of those categories which suggested the percentage of residents who would fall into categories 1 to 5. In that document or in the explanatory memorandum there was a statement that there would be an attempt to reduce the number of patients in category 5 by attempting to ensure that those residents went into hostels. I said in my speech that if that happened the nature of the population in nursing homes would shift and across the nation we would have fewer patients in category 5 than we have now. I think there are about 10 per cent of patients now in category 5. The Department might be able to remind me of the figure. As we are moving towards a policy of decreasing the number of patients in category 5, will the Government increase the number of categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 patients that it will fund and reduce the number of category 5 patients?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have before me a copy of the November 1988 edition of Residential Care News. Senator Patterson was right when she said that 10 per cent of patients were in category 5. On page 4 of the November edition of Residential Care News there is a table which shows that Australia-wide the percentage of patients in category 5 is 10.4 per cent. The Government anticipated that the figure would be about 20 per cent. If one looks at the State by State breakdown of the figures one sees that the population of a category depends on what State the patients come from. The percentage of Western Australian and New South Wales patients in this category is quite a bit higher, two or three percentage points higher, than the percentage of patients from other States in this category. But in Queensland and South Australia the percentage is much lower. The answer to the honourable senator's question as to whether the Government is prepared to adjust the percentage of patients in categories 1 and 2 is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To step back from the particular question, answer it with a generality and come to the honourable senator's point, the threat by the Victorian health funds to cease paying benefits for nursing home-type patients in Bush Nursing hospitals is, in our view, and, I think, in anyone's view unacceptable action. Health funds have a moral and legal obligation to pay benefits to the patients involved. In many cases patients have contributed to their health funds for many years in the belief over the last decade that benefits would be payable in these circumstances. Since 1979 it has been the practice for nursing home-type patients to be accommodated in both public and private hospitals and for health funds to pay benefits at the lower, nursing home-type patient rate for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The health funds recently sought to exploit what they believed to be a loophole in the 1979 legislation allowing them to abrogate a responsibility which they had accepted for almost a decade. In order to reinforce the obligation of the health funds, the Government introduced legislation on 10 November this year to clarify that requirement and confirm the 1979 arrangements. In the longer term the Government is prepared to work with the funds and the State governments on particular problems involving aged and long stay patients. Considerable advances have already been made in this area under this Government. Earlier this week senior officials of the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health had preliminary discussions with Victorian officials and visited a range of service facilities in rural Victoria to examine the cost and feasibility of various approaches to providing good care for frail aged people in small population centres. </PARA>

The other question I would like to ask the Minister is one I have asked the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) but as yet have not had an answer. I asked that question not all that long ago. With the resident classification it has been pointed out to me that there have been some genuine errors where, for example, one proprietor filled in a classification medical record incorrectly. The nursing home receives $8.32 per day less because a genuine error was made as the director of nursing had the flu. Because of the number of appeals that are being made genuine ones are being missed out. I know that the Department is trying to address this problem. In the interim, people who have made genuine errors are being penalised because of some vexatious appellants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Officers from the Department cannot advise me at present in terms of Senator Patterson's general question. As I understand her question, it is that there are frivolous appeals and genuine appeals and how do we sort the wheat from the chaff and expeditiously deal with the genuine ones and reply promptly to disallow the frivolous ones. In any large system such as this, that is a constant problem. I noted in the beginning of her question that she indicated that she had asked it directly of the Minister, Dr Blewett. I am not able to be advised here now as to what the answer to the question is. But I take the raising of it by Senator Patterson in this procedure as being an indication that we should hotfoot it back to the Department and give the honourable senator an answer pronto, which we will do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter at this late stage which would not have needed to be raised had I obtained an answer from the Department of Community Services and Health prior to this. I have not had an answer from the Department. A number of senators spent hours on the Estimates Committee. I asked a question in relation to Australia giving a special grant to the specific World Health Organisation program called the special program of research development, research training and human reproduction. In 1985 this special program decided that its priority research area would be the development of the abortion drug RU486 and the development of an abortifacient anti-HCG vaccine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the benefit of the Committee, it is important to note that the drug RU486 functions by blocking the foetus's use of a vital nutritive hormone, progesterone. Without this the unborn human being starves to death and drops off the uterus wall. Bleeding and severe cramps then take place and in most cases the woman has an abortion. I wish to ask a question in respect of that program which relates to the drug RU486 and the abortifacient anti-HCG vaccine. I shall quote from page F123 of the Estimates Committee F transcript:</PARA>
<PARA> If Australia gives a specific grant to this specific WHO program and has agreed to trial it in Australia, and is a member of the Policy and Coordinating Advisory Committee of the program, surely it is relevant for one to ask what policy was expressed by the representative of Australia, and whether that policy reflected the view of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Committee would be interested in the response. The Department slightly changed my question, nominating RU486 after the word `it'. `It' referred to the program and the program has two elements: one is the development of RU486 and the other is the development of the anti-HCG vaccine. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is a member of the Policy Coordinating Advisory Committee of the program. The last meeting of this Committee, now termed the PCC, was held in Geneva from 4 to 6 July 1988 and was attended by representatives from the Permanent Mission of Australia to the UN office in General and from ADAB Canberra. The representatives did not put a view to the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not my question. That is not an answer to my question. In fact, I regard that as an insult. If the officers of the Department had read my question, as they should have-they were present at the Estimates Committee hearing-they would have known that I was referring to the decision of the Committee, of which Australia is a member, to adopt this program as a priority. I want an answer to that question. I now ask that question again. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me turn to Senator Harradine's question. First, I thank him for the courtesy of indicating to me today that he would pursue this matter in the Committee of the Whole this evening. I thank him also for drawing my attention to page F123 of the Senate Estimates Committee Hansard of 20 October, on which the honourable senator asked this question and remarked on what he perceived to be the inadequacy of the answer by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Health Organisation's research training in human reproduction program, commonly known as the HRP, or the human reproduction program, is a program which supports, among a number of other initiatives-this is not the only initiative, there is a whole range of initiatives-the research into RU486. Australia supports the program. It is to be seen as supporting the whole program in a holistic way, rather than supporting particular issues within it. We in Australia recognise that this drug had other properties than the the ones the honourable senator had described. For example, it is a drug that properly can be used where the foetus has died in the womb so as to expel that foetus so that the health of the mother is maintained. From an Australian point of view, that is a proper medical use of the drug. While it could-as the honourable senator has described and as I am informed-have other uses, we see it as fulfilling that particular use. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to what the Australian representative to the Policy Coordinating Advisory Committee said on behalf of Australia when this matter was before the Committee, I am advised that Australia's representative on that Committee has since left our employ and joined the World Health Organisation. I am not able to give the honourable member the verbatim reply for two reasons. The first reason is that I understand that the proceedings of the Committee are not necessarily recorded. It is not the sort of proceeding for which one is able to obtain the record and look matters up. It is more a discussion type format. Although interpretation is involved it does not involve verbatim transcripts or electronic recordings. The second reason is that we have some difficulty in reaching the individual concerned to find out exactly what he may have said. To answer Senator Harradine's question in precise terms, I think that we would need to have done that. I undertake that we will attempt to do that. Having said both those things, I should say that the attitude of the Government is well known. We would expect that a representative of the Australian Government, serving on a body such as that, would represent our views appropriately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine asked a series of questions as he put his question together, and I will try to work through them in a logical order. The Government is supporting research training in the human reproduction program, which is a World Health Organisation program. I have not got the actual figure at hand, but from recollection the figure the honourable senator described seems to be accurate as to the funding we put down for that whole program. Within that program there are, of course, elements of the program and those elements have a priority. I am informed that the drug RU486 is a priority drug. I cannot confirm that it is an overwhelming priority, but it is a priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I said this earlier, but we in Australia, quite apart from any of the comments the honourable senator made about the role and purpose of that drug, identify a particular, if you like-I am trying to find the right words; they are not `mainstream medical purpose' because that imputes a value that I do not wish to impute-therapeutic purpose in that when a foetus dies in the womb and there is a risk of infection to the mother, this drug can be administered and the foetus expelled and the mother's health not be impaired. That is one of the reasons why Australia would support the development of this drug. On that basis I see nothing inconsistent with our support for the general program, and indeed the priorities within the program. As far as the vaccine is concerned, in a minute I will get some particular advice on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on to the question of what our representatives said. The honourable senator raised his question on the basis that in the Estimates Committee F hearing of 20 October he pursued this issue and the Department undertook to reply to him. The Department has replied and the honourable senator notified me earlier this afternoon that the reply is inadequate. On that basis I have spoken to the Department. My advice is simply that the officer concerned has now joined the World Health Organisation and we are doing our best to obtain from him the information the honourable senator seeks. However, I did point out that since the officer was an individual accredited to serve on behalf of this Department in that capacity, we would have expected him to have properly, fully and appropriately represented the views of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister any further response to the question I asked in respect of the ethical evaluation of the trialling of the abortifacient anti-HCG vaccine and the drug RU486 for the termination of pregnancy? I ask specifically: Was there any ethical evaluation at international level prior to the request made to the Department regarding their trial in Australia? Now, there was a response to that and that response, in effect, says that there was not any such ethical evaluation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet I point out to the Minister that in another Estimates Committee, where the amount for the special program was under consideration, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), in nailing his colours to the mast of RU486 and enthusiastically supporting this research, declared that it was `wholly salutary, desirable and a course of activity that should be totally and thoroughly encouraged and welcomed by the Australian Government'. He was not talking about the use of that drug for medical purposes. He was talking about the use of that drug to induce abortions as a method of family planning. He went on to say that he acknowledged that ethical considerations did arise and had to be addressed somewhere along the line. When I asked him whether they had been addressed by the Government, he said, `I am confident that WHO is an organisation whose ethics can be relied on in the conduct of its research and in the operation consequences that flow from it. I for one will not do anything on behalf of this Government other than encourage that sort of activity'. In other words, he was putting his complete faith in World Health Organisation (WHO) ethical procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the response that the Department belatedly gave me to my question on 20 October. That response is undated but, from memory, it probably came in on Monday. What that document said is there was an in-house evaluation by a group known as the WHO Secretariat Evaluation Committee for Research into Human Subjects. That group says that it does not seek to second guess national measures and only in very rare circumstances would approval not be forthcoming for a project which has met national and WHO technical safety requirements. So reading that document as a whole, it is clear there have been no stringent ethical evaluations of the use of drug RU486 or the anti-HCG vaccine. Yet the Government leaps into paying money for the development of this drug. That is a matter which raises very serious questions indeed, particularly if we look at the groups who want to get their hands on this drug. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest group that wants to get its hand on this drug is the State Family Planning Commission of China. The State Family Planning Commission of China is engaged in a coercive family planning policy. Indeed, an article in the Canberra Times of 3 July 1988 under the heading `Mothers flee family planners' says:</PARA>
<PARA>Chinese mothers are fleeing their homes to escape abortion or sterilisation under the strict government policy of one child per family . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have to read the Canberra Times. I have read a number of other articles just recently about the coercive family planning policies in China in the Action China, paper No. 10 of July 1988. It includes a quote from the Conference on Strategic Management on Population Programmes held in Beijing. According to the Minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission, among the requirements of the Commission was that there should be:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . fewer births, the practice of ``one couple, one child''; to allow couples in rural areas with one daughter to have a second child with planned spacing; and to avoid second or more births. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, there is a whole range of material that is available. Specifically, what we are doing in this program is developing these new weapons of chemical warfare aimed at unborn children and forcibly imposed against all human rights by the State Family Planning Commission of China. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have a good look at this question and see what it is getting into. I will leave it there. I do not want to canvass the matter but I thought I would take the opportunity to raise it because I am sure that many Government members would not know. I know that people regard WHO with very great respect, and it is well deserved in a number of areas. But on this matter I beg to say to the Government, `Please have a look at it because it is not deserved'. If the Government wants the proof I have it in my file. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the document that has been tabled is the response that we got from the Department of Community Services and Health on Monday, or thereabouts, I was not expecting that; I was expecting something else. An analysis of this document indicates that it does not really answer my question. I asked whether, prior to the decision by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Committee to trial and possibly use the abortifacient anti-HCG vaccine or the abortion drug RU486 for termination of pregnancy, there was any ethical evaluation at an international level prior to the Department's request regarding their trial in Australia. That is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking about very deep ethical considerations here. One of the hottest issues in America, for example, is ethics in public administration. It is all the rage and all the talk there, but here we have seen an international fast shuffle, where there has been no ethical evaluation by an independent ethics evaluation committee. It is clear here that there is an in-house committee which, presumably, is loaded with scientific personnel who, because it is in-house, are committed to trialling these substances; therefore, their ethical evaluation is worth nothing. In fact, we have not been given the details of their evaluation. I want the details of even that internal committee's evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of this document is that the WHO Secretariat Evaluation Committee for Research into Human Subjects does not seek to second-guess national measures, and only in very rare circumstances would approval not be forthcoming for a project which has met national and WHO technical safety requirements. We are talking about ethical evaluations. The document goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>The Phase 1 trial of ANTI-HCG vaccine being conducted by Professor Jones in South Australia and all RU486 studies supported by WHO (at present none in Australia) have passed through these processes. </PARA>

<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA>I want to let the Minister down very slowly. He has said that, as far as the Australian Government is concerned, RU486 is to be used to evacuate a deceased foetus from the uterus. That study is going on in Australia, yet the WHO document states that no studies are going on in Australia. This document is right. That organisation knows what it is talking about. It knows that it is talking about RU486 as a termination of pregnancy drug, not what the Minister is talking about at all. It obviously knows what it is talking about; it is talking about a drug for the termination of pregnancy. Because the Government has decided, that is what we, the taxpayers of Australia, are funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that, from information I have received under freedom of information (FOI) on the drug, WHO had decided that this drug ought to be trialled in Australia before any ethical consideration of it was given in Australia. So really this document is meaningless. The document says that it relies on what happened in the particular country in which it is trialled. In fact, the decision was made to invite Dr David Healy of Victoria to undertake a clinical trial of the drug. I will not go into the details but we are getting into very murky areas here where there has not been an international ethical evaluation of this program. The anti-HCG program was decided upon by WHO before any ethical consideration was given to it in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received details under FOI about what has happened about the anti-HCG vaccine. This information reveals that WHO actually chose the Flinders Medical Centre for the world's first human trial of the vaccine. This was announced in a press statement dated 17 February 1986. It is important to note that from the FOI material it appeared that, at a meeting of 8 November 1984, the Department required evidence of approval by the ethics committee at Flinders before final approval would be given. This was finalised on 1 May 1985 simply by the drug company Sandos supplying a simple form from the committee on clinical investigation at Flinders advising the researcher Professor Warren Jones that it had approved his application. Having obtained that form, it appears that the Department of Community Services and Health was satisfied that ethical necessities had been accommodated. I do not think that that is at all satisfactory. I want to know the composition of the committee on clinical investigation at Flinders. It appears that the whole thing rests on that. </PARA>

If there is, it should occur at least on the basis of the understanding of procedures agreed between us. The understanding of procedures that I want to clarify now relating to these ethical considerations is first, the role and the function of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in making ethical considerations. The World Health Organisation, as an international body, consists of countries with all sorts of different religious, moral and cultural codes. Those countries are affiliated with WHO for the services it provides. It is thus not a body which, of itself, decides on a universal or world ethical code; it identifies particular developments in medicine. Component countries of WHO then decide what they may do ethically in terms of testing or evaluating those things.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In the case of RU486, an ethical determination was handed down for Australia by the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) appropriate committee. It concluded that this drug could be trialled in Australia, within the limits of an application where foetuses have died in the womb and need to be expelled lest the health of the parent is endangered. It is in that context that the NHMRC made its ethical determination. It is the case that other countries affiliated with WHO make different ethical considerations. Without arguing the point of what Senator Harradine put earlier, he cited, for example, the particular approach taken by the People's Republic of China in terms of its family planning program. That is an approach it takes which it sees, in terms of its application of ethics, as appropriate for it. This is not a debate about whether its ethics are right. In terms of the ethics applying to Australia, I think it is correct to say that the ethical consideration has been for the use of this drug to assist in protecting the health of mothers where in late pregnancy there is a foetal death. </PARA>

I make the very simple point that there is no misunderstanding at all. What the World Health Organisation (WHO) is talking about when it talks about RU486 is an abortion drug to induce the termination of a pregnancy. That is why it says in the document the Minister has incorporated that at present there are no studies being done in Australia. We are funding this program in WHO for that purpose. I am appealing to the Government that we have better things to do with our money than that. That we are funding this program is something I believe many are not aware of but will soon become aware of. I hope that point will be taken on board. I do not think this is the time or the hour to debate the issue. In fact, the Committee got rather full answers from questions it put to the NHMRC on other matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take half an hour of the Committee's time, but I will discuss a matter which I believe is of very considerable importance. Earlier the Committee passed a motion which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, having considered the report of Estimates Committee E in relation to the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Committee of the Whole-</PARA>
<PARA>recommends that the Senate agree to the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the table of the Senate on or before 5 December 1988:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) A copy of the report of auditors Arthur Andersen and Co., referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the course of his reply to a question without notice by the member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) in the other place on 8 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a copy of the record of proceedings of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs senior officers' meeting held on 5 September 1988</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a copy of any note for file made by Mr McDonald, as senior officer of DAA, recording his meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 1 September, during which the issue of funding for NAIHO was discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently Senator Tate-and I thank him for this-tabled various papers. As I understand it, he did not table the first document requested, namely, the report of the auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co. He did table certain other documents, including file notes relating to the matter under issue. He also purported to table the minutes of the meeting of senior officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on 5 September, a record of proceedings which shows, in the one page that he tabled:</PARA>
<PARA>`At a meeting with the Minister on Thursday 1 September, the Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding. This is to be confirmed in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the minute said. Senator Tate tabled a very curious document earlier this evening. He tabled one page of this record of proceedings. Obviously, it is an incomplete record. I would have to say that at first glance it looks very much like a scissors and paste job. It in no way could be a full record of the proceedings of the meeting as some of the subheadings were left off. It has an extraordinarily incomprehensible numbering system for the points that are raised. I ask Senator Tate to recheck with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that what he has tabled is, in fact, a full and complete record of the proceedings of that meeting of senior officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on 5 September, because it certainly does not appear to be so. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> Setting that aside, the point to be made is that the minutes of that meeting-the record of proceedings-confirm what we have said today in this place, and that is that on 31 August at a meeting between the Minister and members of National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation the Minister agreed to a refunding to NAIHO of $180 000. The other documents that have been tabled are mainly notes for files. They show-I will not go into all the details tonight; there will be time next week-that until at least 18 October it was clearly understood within the Department that the Minister had agreed to the refunding of NAIHO and that the only point at issue was the precise amount to be funded. That depended upon negotiations and discussions to take place with the organisation because there was some doubt about the staffing levels involved and a couple of matters of that nature. As late as 18 October, these papers show, there was no doubt in anybody's mind that the Minister had agreed to refund NAIHO. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Tate tabled these papers tonight he seemed to be relying on a typed up minute which is dated 1 December to cast doubt on this. It says that after Question Time on 8 November the undermentioned officers discussed issues arising with the Minister. Those undermentioned officers were Mr Pryor, Mr Winroe, Mr O'Rourke and Mr Strokowsky and Ms Harriet Swift. Those five persons have signed the note dated 1 December. </PARA>

On 8 November, three to four weeks ago, Mr Shipton asked the Minister, Mr Hand, in the House of Representatives about a re-funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, NAIHO. Mr Hand, in his response, amongst other things, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I have met with representatives of that body-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, NAIHO-</PARA>
<PARA>and have discussed funding arrangements for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am yet to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he told the House of Representatives on 8 November. The documents that have been tabled tonight show quite clearly that on 31 August at a meeting with representatives of NAIHO he did agree to the refunding. So Mr Hand lied to the House of Representatives in his answer to Mr Shipton on 8 November. The only thing that can possibly cast any doubt on that assertion is this minute written yesterday, obviously putting pressure on the officer of the Department who --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He failed to tell the truth, Mr Temporary Chairman.

They obviously attempted to put pressure on Mr McDonald yesterday and the minute that is dated yesterday is the only indication that there was anything different from what has been recorded consistently since 1 September to the effect that the Minister had approved the NAIHO refunding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a matter of the gravest importance. It goes to propriety and ministerial integrity. I repeat that Mr Hand did not convey the truth to the House of Representatives on 8 November. He knew on 8 November when he told the Parliament that he had not made a decision on the refunding of NAIHO that he had two months earlier made such a decision. That adds greatly to the whole saga in relation to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that has been disclosed in the Senate Estimates committees and other forums of this Parliament. Several weeks ago we called on the Minister to resign over his handling of the whole of the administration and conduct of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission. We will be pursuing this matter with great vigour, I assure honourable senators opposite, over the days ahead. I repeat here and now my call that the Minister, Mr Hand, has no alternative but to resign, and another reason has now been added: not only has he proved to be a complete failure in the administration of his department but he has also absolutely deliberately misled the Parliament of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the motion moved earlier this evening by the Opposition on this important matter it was requested, in three particular paragraphs, that documents be tabled in the Committee. I have been absent from the chamber for part of this evening, but I now note that the documents that have been tabled are only part of what was covered by the various requests made and it is indicative of this Government that it seems to blunder its way through by attempting to cover up things quickly as they occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the motion moved by the Opposition last evening we requested that we be provided with a copy of the report of the auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co., referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the course of his reply to a question without notice by the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Shipton, in the other place on 8 November 1988. I notice that that auditors' report is not included with the partial tabling of documents by Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a request was made for a copy of the record of proceedings of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) senior officers' meeting held on 5 September 1988. The document that has been tabled this evening in response to that request is an edited form of the minutes of that meeting. The document that has been presented to the Committee is headed `Senior Officers' Meeting, 5 September 1988, Record of Proceedings'. It then lists the people who were present at the meeting. I note that there were 16 people present. The Chairman of the meeting was the honorary secretary of the Department, Mr Charles Perkins. Also present were Messrs Winroe, O'Rourke, Menham, Miller, Strokowsky, Martin, Toohey, Oakes, McDonald, Frampton, Dobb, Lisson, Ms Humes and Mr Duggan. The recorder was Noel Baxendell. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> The document states `Meeting commenced at 10.05 am' and a comment follows about some other point. The document then goes straight into point (n) of the minutes. So what has been omitted? In the document I was quoting from earlier in the evening 1 3/4 pages appeared before point (n). All that we are insultingly given is point (n)-the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) resolution which Senator Short just referred to, and which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>At a meeting with the Minister on Thursday 1 September, the Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding. This is to be confirmed in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>Point (o) and point (p) follow, on different issues, and that is all. As Senator Archer says, the minute was requested in full by the Committee in its motion. The motion requested that a copy of the record of proceedings of the meeting held on 5 September 1988 be tabled. The minute, in the documents that have been presented here tonight, has been doctored. What an insult to the Senate! The third paragraph of the motion requested a copy of any note for file made by Mr McDonald as a senior officer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs recording his meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 1 September, during which the issue of funding for NAIHO was discussed. What do we have on that? We have the minute. Thankfully, that minute is the minute that has been presented in full, over Mr McDonald's signature. That is a most important note for file. It is headed `Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Note for File, NAIHO 1988/89 Budget'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister met NAIHO representatives in his Canberra office for approximately 1 1/4 hours on 31 August. I was present in the general office but did not actually take part in the meeting at any stage. At the end of the meeting the Minister informed me that he had approved funding of about $180,000 for NAIHO with effect from 1 December. He would confirm this with a written advice to the Department. In response to a question from me the Minister agreed that points 1 and 2 in the attachment II of the attached brief were an appropriate description of NAIHO's role for the purpose of the letter of offer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed `D McDonald, Acting Assistant Secretary, Community Development', and dated 1 September 1988. There is a hand written note on the file which reads, `Director, H and SS, Noted'. The note is initialled and dated `1/9'. It then reads `To see and file please'. It is then initialled and similarly dated. So the file was noted and received by the Department on 1 September. This matter was raised in the house of Representatives on 8 November. There is a file note dated 1 December 1988-today's date-and signed by five officers of the Department. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>After Question Time on 8 November the undermentioned officers discussed issues arising with the Minister. Those present were-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is most important-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr G. Prior, Mr R. Winroe, Mr D. O'Rourke, Mr M. Strokowsky, Ms H. Swift. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA>Five people were present at that meeting with the Minister on 8 November. Only three of those people were present at the meeting on 5 September. So they were doing a quick cover up. That minute goes on to say that the members present with the Minister proceeded to ring Mr McDonald. Where is Mr McDonald? He has been sent off to Western Australia as the Acting Regional Manager. He has been pulled out of the Canberra office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and packed off as the Acting Regional Manager of Western Australia to replace Mr Cedric Wyatt, who has been shuffled sideways into the Acting General Manager's position at the Aboriginal Development Commission. What a shuffling of the pack! over a conference line, as this minute refers to, they then talked to Mr McDonald and in the presence of members asked him to confirm whether the discussion was wrong and incorrect. Mr McDonald would have had none of the files in front of him during that discussion. He would not have had access to any of the records in Perth. The minute makes no reference to the fact that they bothered to fax him any of the details or that they bothered to exchange any of it. The way in which it has been presented to this Committee is shameful.</PARA>
<PARA> This minute is dated today. So obviously after I raised this matter in here today a number of these officers who were sitting in the advisers gallery ducked out of here, headed off to the Minister's office, concocted this particular memo and had those officers present devise a particular mechanism in order to cover for Mr Hand again. Mr Hand is in trouble. He has misled the House of Representatives both today and on 8 November. He was aware that in September he agreed to the $180,000 funding for NAIHO. Yet he had the audacity in the House of Representatives, in answer to a question from Mr Shipton on 8 November, to say that the arrangements were not in place and that they had not been agreed to. This is so illustrative of all the mucking about, fiddling of the books and the dreadful type of administration that was going on throughout the Department, obviously before we got to look at it in the Senate Estimates Committee on 21, 25 and 26 October. </PARA>
<PARA> When the House of Representatives started to take a keen interest in this matter in early November, again the Minister and his officers concocted various ways in which to put this together. I believe that the documents that have been presented here tonight only partially meet the resolution of this Senate earlier this evening. In bringing them in in such a partial manner does no credit to this Government. It certainly reveals that Hand cannot be trusted; that very obviously the manner in which he fiddles with his staff and in which he shoehorns the officers of his Department into meeting his requirements and his needs is the sign of a very desperate Minister. Obviously, the Prime Minister now needs to look at this matter again, and sack Mr Hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring the Minister back to the matter which I raised with him earlier on, in respect of the acquittal of grants and the competence and capacity of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs appropriately to account for those matters. Primarily, I asked: How many unacquitted grants has the Department outstanding? I asked: What are the numbers for each State? What is the Government doing about these unacquitted grants and why have they occurred? I asked: Are the departmental officers sufficiently skilled to deal with the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I remind the chamber that I asked those simple questions of the Minister in this place on 25 November. I asked the Minister then: could he tell me whether or not the departmental officers were sufficiently skilled to deal with the matter? I asked Senator Tate: Is the Department enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants? I further asked: Are grants still being made to organisations which have unacquitted grants? That was on 25 November. To this day I cannot get an answer to any one of those questions. If for some obscure reason, the Department is so incompetent that it is unable to provide statistical information, I would have thought it would have been in a position to know whether or not its officers were skilled, competent and capable enough to provide for the management of taxpayers' funds in the form of grants to Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister was not able to tell me whether or not the officers were sufficiently skilled to deal with the matter. My own endeavours tell me that a review, for instance, was undertaken of the major projects in the Geraldton region funded in the 1987-88 financial year. The Geraldton region, in the mid-west of Western Australia, is typical; it is not unique. A method of review was undertaken. Key elements of project administration were reviewed for compliance with departmental procedures. The major components reviewed were: the authorisation of supply period funding; offer and acceptance of grants; release of recurrent funds; receipt and examination of financial statements; releases of capital funds; and grants acquittals-I remind the Minister-was an item on the list. </PARA>
<PARA> Project officers were consulted in the course of the review and provided with an appreciation of the deficiencies noted. I refer the Minister to the findings of his own Department in respect of acquittals, for which the Department has not yet been able to provide figures. The findings were:</PARA>

<PARA> This breakdown was attributed, in part, to the transitional arrangements that accompanied the transfer of the Regional administration from the Perth Regional Office to Geraldton . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was a simple transfer of some responsibilities. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Project files and the filing system maintained during the period under review were extremely poor. </PARA>
<PARA> files were difficult to identify and to locate. </PARA>
<PARA> key documents such as letters of offer and acceptance forms C4 weren't consistently located on files. </PARA>

<PARA>I remind honourable senators that we are not talking about inventories; we are not talking about offers and acceptances; and we are not talking about acceptance and acknowledgment of finances in petty cash. We are talking about tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. We are told in this document that the Department is not competent and not capable of discharging its own responsibilities. There was very little evidence on the files that follow-up action on outstanding financial reports had been effected-leading to the conclusion that grant monitoring was poorly executed. It is no wonder the Department was able to tell me the number of unacquitted grants. Under the heading `Financial Reporting' the Department observed in respect of its own officers:</PARA>
<PARA> The standards of financial reports submitted by funded organisations was extremely poor. </PARA>
<PARA> Many organisations failed to comply with grant conditions with regard to the financial information required by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Major deficiencies noted included:</PARA>
<PARA> incomplete financial returns,</PARA>
<PARA> statements of debtors/creditors not being submitted. </PARA>
<PARA> One major organisation presented complicated working papers for several grants in lieu of prescribed periodical financial statements. These weren't analysed and indeed such an analysis would be extremely difficult to undertake without first hand knowledge of the financial affairs of the organisation concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no record of correspondence seeking more informative reports from the organisation concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Department was prepared to stand by in silence and recognise and acknowledge the failings of the various organisations in respect of their funding. It was prepared to do absolutely nothing about the matter. There was an attempt made in terms of training, and that appears to have failed also. The Department then took itself to the bureaucratic fall-back position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I refer-if the Australian Democrats will listen for a moment-to the bureaucratic description of when the system fails for it. The heading is `damage control'. These are the Government's negotiations at the moment. The document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major deficiencies noted were:-</PARA>
<PARA> Inadequate filing systems</PARA>
<PARA> Financial Reporting by organisations was poor</PARA>
<PARA> Staff didn't consistently follow prescribed procedures conveying key elements of project administration</PARA>
<PARA> Some major organisations called for immediate attention</PARA>
<PARA> Action recommended is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on, in respect of filing, to tell us:</PARA>
<PARA> Steps have been taken by the newly appointed Regional Manager to install a new filing system. However a major effort is required to establish this system in order to overcome previous neglect. </PARA>
<PARA> This system should be properly maintained and training of staff should be oversighted by the Administrative Officer and the Regional Manager. </PARA>
<PARA> Documentation misplaced in the course of the transition from the Perth Regional Office to the Geraldton Regional Office should be located and placed on file. </PARA>
<PARA> Redundant and old files should be examined and archived immediately to clear the filing system. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of financial reporting, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Steps should be taken to ensure that the financial reports now due (to 30.6.88) are received, examined and efficiencies followed up immediately with organisations. Where organisations do not employ competent bookkeepers steps should be taken to utilise A.O.T. funds to provide proper training. </PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the point I sought to raise earlier on, and that is the responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in respect of the failure for the funding of the various organisations. What is the Department's responsibility in respect of bookkeepers? What is the Department's responsibility in terms of the employment of project officers? There is an absolute litany of failures in respect of the whole range of organisations, where no attempt has been made by the Department to ensure that the tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars are in any way reasonably accounted for. Every time I have asked the Minister to give an explanation and a definition to me as to that which ought to be the norm and the guideline in respect of the standards that the Department expects, there has been a deafening silence. </PARA>

<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties I suspect that the Government is having is that it has so politicised the Department that it is no longer able to get objective, reasonable, competent or capable advice. I suggest, with respect, that this is summed up by a letter by Brian Wyatt, the Convener of the Australian Labor Party's policy on Aboriginal Affairs. He did work for Mr Ernie Bridge, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the State Labor Government for the time being. He was writing to Mr Cedric Wyatt, who is the Regional Director in Western Australia for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Mr Cedric Wyatt has now, if my memory serves me correctly, been transferred to the Aboriginal Development Commission. He told us in evidence that his qualification for being on that Commission was his special administrative skills. Mr Wyatt has got 800 unacquitted grants in Western Australia alone, amounting to tens of millions of dollars. When I have asked the Department to give me the total number in Western Australia, the global figure in dollars and cents, which grants are unacquitted, which grants are acquitted, which communities are affected, which are not, what the Department is doing about it, whether it has officers of competence, capability and intelligence capable of solving the problem, I am told that the Department needs eight days to tell me whether or not it has one officer capable of solving the problem. Mr Cedric Wyatt was the Regional Director at the time, but perhaps he was concentrating on other things. Brian Wyatt, the Convener of the Labor Party's platform on Aboriginal Affairs, wrote to Mr Cedric Wyatt at his office at 256 Adelaide Terrace, Perth-which is the office, as the Minister would know, for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-and he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Cedric,</PARA>
<PARA>Attached for your comment are proposed amendments to the State Platform on Aboriginal Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the State Labor Party platform on Aboriginal Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA>Committee reports must be in by 8th July 1988 for the State Conference in September. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the State conference of the land council, or the State conference of the regional officers, or the State conference on Aboriginal matters. This is the State Conference of the Labor Party. We are then told:</PARA>
<PARA>The next meeting is set for 5.30 on Tuesday 14th June, 1988. </PARA>

<PARA>There we have a regional director written to in his official position, at his official address, and enclosed with this document was a draft platform of the Australian Labor Party in respect of Aboriginal affairs. The head of the Department was asked for his comments and to attend the meeting of the Labor Party to substantiate his amendments and his proposals. Is it any wonder they have problems? Surely that was manifest in the explanatory memorandums of the Aboriginal Development Commission where there was a great deal of criticism by Mr Miller from the Department of explanatory notes offered by the Aboriginal Development Commission. One of the complaints was that the notes were not political enough. The complaint that was made was that the Minister had not been protected enough and, least of all, the Department had not been protected enough. In fact, the complaint went on to in effect say that what is being said is that we are doing the same thing that we are blaming the Western Australian Government for; is that not terribly wrong? So honourable senators opposite wonder why they have the imbroglio they have-the confusion, the chaos, the loss of statistics, the failure to provide answers and Senator Aulich sitting there giggling and smiling and embarrassed and confused. It is no wonder the mess is as it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to move an amendment to the motion that is currently before the Chair which relates to the reporting of the Committee's inquiries. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of the motion add, `and that the Senate censures the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Tate, for tabling an incomplete document in response to the Order of the Senate that a copy of the record of proceedings of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs Senior Officers Meeting held on 5 September 1988 be produced. </PARA>
<PARA>I will explain the total context in which this tabling has occurred, because I think that is necessary to make sense of this motion. Earlier this evening there was a debate about issues which were originally raised in the House of Representatives and which flowed from a question which was asked by Mr Roger Shipton, of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. That matter has already been substantially canvassed in debate but I remind the Committee that, as a part of his answer, Mr Hand indicated he had met with representatives of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and discussed funding arrangements for the future and he used the words, `I am yet to make a decision'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I point out that a national inquiry is being conducted by both the States and the Commonwealth regarding future health care policy for Aboriginal people; and that body will be reporting back in February. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Hand had to say on 8 November and, what is quite clear from that statement is that Mr Hand was representing to the House of Representatives that no decisions had been made on NAIHO funding. Earlier this evening, the Committee carried a resolution that there be laid on the table of the Senate a number of documents. They were a copy of the report of auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co., referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the course of his reply to the question to which I have referred. Secondly, a copy of the record of proceedings of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) senior officers meeting held on 5 September 1988. Thirdly, a copy of any note for file made by Mr McDonald, as senior officer of DAA, recording his meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 1 September, during which the issue of funding for NAIHO was discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) chose to come into the Committee and to respond partially to that resolution and to produce part of the documentation which was sought in that resolution. The amendment which I am moving is not being moved because the Minister chose to give us some of what was requested, but because what the Minister gave us is quite clearly not what it purported to be. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> It remains true that there are other documents to be presented. On the face of the documents which have already been presented to the Committee there is little doubt that we will have further debate in the Senate next week about the situation with respect to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the answer he gave in the House of Representatives as against the papers which have now been produced and perhaps the further papers which have yet to be produced. If one examines the papers which have already been tabled by the Minister, one finds a fairly disturbing sequence which has already been very adequately discussed by Senator Tambling and by Senator Short, who addressed the subject of these papers just a little time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> What is quite clear is that on the face of the documents that the Minister has given us it was reported to the senior officers meeting on 5 September under the heading `NAIHO (Mr McDonald)':</PARA>
<PARA>At a meeting with the Minister on Thursday 1 September, the Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding this is to be confirmed in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>What follows is a series of notes which are confirmatory of that earlier meeting. What we then find is that there was a discussion on the matter of NAIHO which was attended by a number of senior officers-Rob Winroe, Mr O'Rourke, Mr Stokowsky, Ms Harriet Swift and Mr G. Pryor. It was agreed that the Minister should telephone McDonald-this is the original notetaker-concerning the senior officer meeting of 5 September as the record of that meeting incorrectly recorded that the Minister had made a funding decision in respect of NAIHO. A note purports to record that the Minister telephoned Mr McDonald in the presence of these officers. The conversation was on the conference line and it was clear to those in attendance that Mr McDonald and the Minister were in agreement that the senior officer meeting minutes were not correct as the Minister had not approved funds to NAIHO as it had been asked to revise its proposal. Mr McDonald agreed to provide a minute concerning the telephone conversation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we will receive a copy of a minute from the hapless Mr McDonald confirming that conversation, I do not know. But it is quite extraordinary that that note sits so oddly against the earlier notes which had been disclosed by the Minister, which make it clear that the record up to that point was that NAIHO funding had been approved although it was subject to some negotiation perhaps as to some of the detail as to staffing and other matters. But to suggest on the face of the documents which have been put before us that a decision had not been made for the funding of NAIHO is patently absurd. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> That is not the point which underlies the amendment which I have moved. The concern which we have and which we wish to express by way of amendment tonight is that the record of proceedings which the Minister has tabled is on the face of it clearly a partial record. Again, that point has been made by both Senator Short and Senator Tambling in debate. The fact of the matter is that the Government has chosen to give us what is clearly a doctored document. It is a scissors and paste document. It is not the complete record of proceedings that it purports on its face to be. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, we believe this is a very serious matter which requires the attention of this Committee. Why does it require the attention of the Committee? It requires the attention of the Committee for reasons which have been discussed in this place on a number of occasions. The principal reason is that it is quite clear that the Government has entered into a course of conduct in which the truth is being obscured. Two matters have already been sent off to the Privileges Committee of the Senate and are under examination. The simple fact of the matter is that in a field of government activity where, as I have said in the Senate before, some very hard games are played we have seen a succession of actions by this Government which are intimidatory in their nature. We have seen the dismissal of the Board of the Aboriginal Development Commission, a board which was not responding to the Government in the way the Government wished. We have heard the concerns which have been expressed in this place about the failure to produce full and truthful information to the committees of this Senate. I put the Government on notice that the opposition will not tolerate any doctoring of the facts in these difficult issues with which we are called upon to deal. We have had a succession of inquiries about the maladministration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. There is no shabbier area in the administration of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> One could go on and chronicle the breaking of the promises which have been made time and time again in the Senate with respect to Aboriginal affairs. I have quoted often in this place the undertakings that were made by ex-Senator Ryan when she was the spokesman for the Opposition before the Labor Party came into government. We have seen a situation where the Aboriginal people were told lies. They were told lies before the election when their votes were bought and they were then told lies for over four years about the intentions of this Government to legislate for national land rights. Every Labor senator in this place knows that there was a complete legislative capacity to do that if the Government had wished. They know that the Australian Democrats have made it absolutely clear throughout the period of this Labor Government that they were more than supportive of the Government's proposals. The Government acted with complete duplicity in that matter. It made promise after promise and it failed totally to deliver. We then had the farce of the treaty, which will never come about, and we have seen again a duplicitous approach by this Government in the raising of Aboriginal expectations and the dashing of them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen over the last few days in the debate on the work of the Senate Estimates committees many examples of the Government's administrative failure and of its failure to tell the truth and come clean on these issues. Now tonight, when the Minister is responding to an order of this Senate, the Minister has delivered us an incomplete record of the senior officers meeting of 5 September. This is a totally inadequate response to the Senate's resolution. The Minister might have shown a little more sense had he examined the documents before he tabled them. He could perhaps have held off tabling them until Monday, when he could have been certain that he was giving the Senate an accurate record. At best, Senator Tate has been utterly careless in his responsibility to this Senate. This is part of a pattern of behaviour which the Opposition is no longer prepared to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is the person fundamentally at fault in respect of this maladministration. I think his predecessor, Mr Holding, is far more at fault than is Minister Hand since he held for much longer the office of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. This action of the Government tonight in delivering incomplete scissors and paste documentation, a doctored record of this senior officers meeting, is totally unsatisfactory to the Opposition and should be totally unsatisfactory to the Committee. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

He is supposed to have the forensic skills to know that in advance. That is what Opposition senators are saying. They are censuring this Minister, not someone else. They are saying either that he knowingly tabled a doctored document or that he lacks competence because he did not know that that document was doctored. None of this has been proved. The Opposition has then gone on to general issues on Aboriginal affairs which have no relevance at all to the censuring of this Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly in support of Senator Chaney's motion to censure the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, for tabling an incomplete document in the Senate tonight. Whatever else we say about this debate, we must say that Senator Tate was obviously very silly to do what he did tonight. One can look at this matter in various ways. Senator Tate may not have examined the papers that he was tabling. He tabled them shortly after the motion for tabling was moved-I must say that was earlier than I had expected. In doing so, he may not have examined those papers. If he did not examine those papers he deserves censure on the ground of stupidity. If Senator Tate has not learned by now, after all that has gone on in the debates in this Parliament, particularly over the last two months, about the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the conduct of its Minister in the maladministration of that Department, he deserves censure. No-one in his right mind when thinking about these issues would take, sight unseen, documents produced out of Mr Hand's office.</PARA></TALK.START>

He had until Monday. The motion gave until 5 December as to its demand for tabling. If the Minister had examined the papers, he must have seen that the document he tabled, purporting to be the record of proceedings of the senior officers' meeting on 5 September 1988, was not a complete document.

No-one would produce a record of proceedings of a meeting which purported to be a full record of proceedings where the lettering system started at (n). Senator Bolkus might do such a thing, but the average person would not. Even the lines in the document do not line up and are not straight across. They could not even get the cut and paste right. The only conclusion that can possibly be drawn is that the Minister has misled the Committee by tabling an incomplete, doctored, scissors and paste document.</PARA></TALK.START>

Last week in the other place the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said to the people of Australia that the Executive was doing a favour to the Parliament by allowing Question Time. Could one get a better example of arrogance and disdain for the proper parliamentary processes in this country?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it is an exaggeration to say that parliamentary democracy is at stake over the matters that have transpired tonight. For honourable senators opposite to indicate that I am one of those Ministers who they have said have treated this place with contempt and in a scandalous way is contrary to the truth. When this chamber passed the resolution earlier I made contact with the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), as honourable senators would expect I would, and I asked that so much of the relevant documentation to help the Committee understand the relationship of the Minister to decisions concerning the funding for the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation be made available. I had checked during the vote that nothing was required to be tabled until Monday, 5 December. But I thought it would aid the Committee-and I am beginning to learn that one does not in good faith try to help this chamber because one just gets belted over the head every time one does-if I made available such documentation as the Minister could provide to help the chamber in making its judgment about the funding issue relating to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amongst the documents that I tabled-and I tabled more than were asked for in order to give a complete picture of the situation-was a document headed, `Senior Officers Meeting, 5 September 1988, Record of Proceedings'. It is clear that the document was telexed over from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It was received in the Minister's office and given to me in a way which, as I have said, was designed to help this chamber by indicating the particular item on the agenda which purported to record the way in which the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation funding issue was dealt with. Indeed, as is reasonably plain in the numbering (n), (o), (p), against those paragraphs, the chamber has been given those parts of the record of proceedings which were designed to help it in its consideration of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation funding issue. </PARA>

<PARA> If they had been doctored-a highly coloured word designed to conjure up all sorts of intimations of an attempt to deliberately mislead the chamber by providing a document which perhaps only partially or in a misleading and out of context way deals with that Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation minute-an attempt would perhaps have been made to make those paragraphs read (a), (b), (c). There is no attempt to doctor. There is no attempt to mislead the chamber. The document provides the information which the Minister's office had faxed to it from the Department relating to the matters which were thought to be of concern to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I also indicated in the course of my remarks when I tabled these documents that it was not the end of the matter and that on Monday there would be a fuller consideration of the terms of the resolution, in particular in relation to the auditors' report. As it has transpired, even though I visited the Minister's office only about 30 minutes ago when Senator Chaney moved his motion, to see whether the full pages of the record of proceedings of the 5 September meeting might be made available, they reached me in the chamber two or three minutes ago. I quite freely table them and make them available to the chamber. They were not available to me at the time when I came into the chamber and tabled the bundle of documents to which I have referred. I quite happily table the full record of proceedings of the senior officers' meeting dated 5 September 1988. There are 10 items. No. 11 is called `Status Report'. Under that heading one runs through the alphabet from (a) to (s), as did Senator Short. Altogether, there are 14 items. </PARA>

<PARA> The small paragraph which is of concern to this chamber relating to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation is in this five-page document which I now have available in exactly the same terms as will be found in the document which I tabled earlier this evening. There is no discrepancy between them. There is no out of context attempt to mislead the chamber by leaving out a paragraph here or there. The page which the chamber has from the record of proceedings was compiled in order to help it in relation to the matters which were thought to be of concern to it, namely the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. The document tabled earlier, rather than being doctored-as I say that has all the overtones of trying to mislead the Committee by deliberately contriving to make the document appear to lead to an incorrect inference or conclusion in relation to the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation funding-is precisely as it appears in the full record. Honourable senators can have access to that because I now table it. I refute the suggestion that in tabling the shorter document I tried to mislead this chamber in any way. I certainly did not. What I tried to do, perhaps too hastily and too speedily, was to provide the chamber with as much information as possible. I could have left it until Monday so that honourable senators opposite did not have the opportunity to go through the information over the weekend. I could have played it that way. Perhaps I was too naive in putting all these documents on the table this evening. That is a lesson I have learnt. When I came into the chamber a moment ago Senator Walters said that I was a slow learner. That is what she said. She is right. I am a slow learner. I am now learning that it is not helpful to come into this chamber and make available in as speedy a way as possible those matters which are required by a resolution of the Committee. Perhaps I take it more seriously than do others. I believe that it is unfair and unwarranted, and a grave exaggeration of the situation, to move a censure motion. It is out of all proportion to the situation. As I have said, I am very happy to make available as much information as possible. On Monday I will report on other elements of the resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following up the point raised by Senator McLean, it is very obvious, from the answers given, that Senator Tate tabled an incomplete document when he tabled the documents. That is not a matter in dispute. The fact is that it was only when this censure motion was put forward by Senator Chaney, which refers to the tabling of an incomplete document in response, that Senator Tate went to Minister Hand's office to seek the full details of the full documentation in regard to the minutes of the meeting of 5 September that are under contention. This is a most important matter. It is a fact that two matters on the administration of Aboriginal Affairs are currently before the Privileges Committee. I would hate to see another matter having to be referred to that Committee if information now proved that the information did not flow properly or that the sequence of events was not properly followed. Like Senator Short, I share the concern about the information that has been provided by Minister Hand's office on many occasions to Senate Estimates Committee E, for debates in this chamber and for Question Time in the House of Representatives. I am sure that Senator Tate must be thoroughly embarrassed at the paucity of advice that has been tendered to him when he represents the Minister, Mr Hand, in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable senators care to look in detail at the answers given recently to Senate Estimates Committee E to the questions that were taken on notice, they will note that dozens of questions had to be referred for subsequent written reply. In the last week numbers of those questions have again been corrected. The information has been sought. I mentioned in debate today one that related to the half million dollars of appropriations to Tranby College in Sydney. So this matter of information flowing out of Minister Hand's office through the Minister in this place, Senator Tate, is a matter of major concern for this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA>We have gone through the ludicrous procedure of unacceptable carelessness of Senator Tate first bringing forward this evening an edited version of those things and without explanation as to why they had been edited. Whilst he made available other information at the same time, the other information and the memos attached to it opened up further inquiry and further information. So the whole matter flows through. At 1.45 a.m. in this chamber we finally got the full, unedited, unabridged set of minutes tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate may admit, as he has done, that to a certain extent he is naive and learning lessons. He has years of experience in this place. Since 21 October Senate Estimates Committee E has been effective in rooting out the maladministration of the Department and in particular the incompetence that comes from Minister Hand's office. We have seen it again illustrated here tonight so graphically that we cannot rely on any of the information that comes from the Minister, Mr Hand. The fact that Senator Tate has to be the vehicle through which that information is provided to this chamber is a major concern. The major issue that is before us tonight is the fact that an incomplete document was provided in response to an order of the Senate. In fact, it is an insult to this chamber that it was so obviously incomplete. It is by the Minister's own admission that the sequence of events that have flowed through tonight is so embarrassing to this Government. </PARA>

When thinking about this matter one might ask oneself whether the Opposition is full of sincerity, full of passion to see that justice and truth are done or whether it wants to tear down a man's reputation for the sake of getting a headline in the morning. How sincere are Opposition members to harass and drive into the ground one of the most decent men one would come across anywhere?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very dangerous question. In the morning, when Opposition senators think about what they have done to somebody for whom they have had a great deal of respect over the years, about the attack they have made on a man whose reputation is amongst the highest in the country, and about what they have done for their own immediate political gain, they will regret the action they have taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, I think we can rely on the people who are going to decide this issue-the Australian Democrats. Senator McLean and Senator Coulter said that all they want to do is look at the evidence and see how they will make the decision. That is a proper approach and I hope they have been satisfied with the evidence that was given promptly and without equivocation by Senator Tate. We cannot expect to convert the very decent people on the other side who live under the name of the Opposition. I am sure that they are all convinced that they ought to vote against Senator Tate. That is not their collective view but each individual one has said that Senator Tate is a man who deserves to be censured, that this person with whom they have sat on committees over the years and with whom they have been very impressed has not spoken the truth-and that is the consequence of their voting against Senator Tate. They are saying that in the answer he has given he has twisted the truth. When the morning comes the Opposition will realise that that view of Senator Tate is not the attitude they should have taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I have the privilege of closing the debate because we are in committee, but I do think it would be useful to get back to the actual charge which is brought in this amendment motion, rather than to deal with the quite different points dealt with by Senator Cooney with such skill. It is an old lawyer's technique that if you have a bad case, talk about another case. Senator Cooney showed great skills in setting up straw men which he then demolished. Let us get back to what this amendment says. What we are complaining about and what we seek to censure the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Tate, for doing is for tabling an incomplete document. That is a matter which has been clearly acknowledged by Senator Tate. He tabled an incomplete document, a document which was not in accord with the order of the Committee which had been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one thing I am grateful to Senator Cooney for is that he reminded us of the skills of Senator Tate. I think it would be fair to say that were Senator Cooney on the front bench, with his more knock-about approach, one might be less inclined to be critical. Were other members of the back bench on the front bench and they made this error, one might be less inclined to be critical also. But as Senator Cooney has said, we are dealing with a man who has one of the highest reputations in the country. We are dealing with a man who was Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Tasmania. We are not dealing with some goat. We are dealing with a person of high legal competence. He has just told us that, in an excess of enthusiasm to serve the will of the Committee, he has brought a document into this place which is, on the face of it, incomplete. He has, at the very minimum, been grossly careless in attention to his duties. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> The context in which this has occurred is a context in which the President of the Senate has said on two occasions that the Opposition had made out a prima facie case that in presenting evidence to the Senate Estimates Committee in this same portfolio area there is a case to be considered for the privilege of the Parliament having been breached. This is a situation where the Committee has made it absolutely clear that we regard access to accurate and clear information as an area of great difficulty and an area where the Government is clearly maladministering a department. The Minister has, in that context, behaved in a way which is inexcusably careless. That is not the standard which is expected of a Minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers of the Crown are judged by exacting standards. I can remember a very popular, well-regarded deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party who signed a letter that he did not read. He lost his job, not because anyone said that he was guilty of moral turpitude; he just did not live up to the standards that the Prime Minister of the day said were required of Ministers of the Crown. We have a skilled lawyer, a man of the highest reputation, who has brought documents into the Committee and has not bothered to check an error which was apparent on the face of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has come in and said, `I have now checked it. I table the document which contains all these paragraphs. Yes, they are there'. I heard Labor Party senators jeering at Senator Short when he said that the clear presumption one makes from these documents is that there are preceding paragraphs. He described the document quite precisely while the Government jeered from the Labor benches. The Minister came in and indicated that the document was precisely in the form that Senator Short had indicated in the debate that it would be. The fact is that the Minister did not bother to check, and he comes in and says, `But it does not matter'. In substance it does not matter because the Senate has not been misled. That is a matter of pure good fortune for this Minister. Those minutes could have contained any amount of material on any subject. This Minister carelessly ignored that possibility. Senator Tate cannot claim as a matter of virtue that the Senate was not misled. It is a lucky accident as far as Senator Tate is concerned. He simply took this document, which clearly had been doctored, and put it down before us. That is scarcely the act of a responsible Minister, a Minister of the skills that everybody keeps talking about Senator Tate having. If it was one of the dogs that were referred to in this debate-we had to withdraw that expression, as I recall-one might be less inclined to be critical. </PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 1-2 December 1988</PARA>
<PARA>1-2 December 1988 SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that this Government's record of misleading the Parliament in this area is as bad as its record of misleading the Aboriginal community. When Senator Robert Ray was filibustering to give Senator Tate time to get the complete document and to get back here to mount his own defence, he said, `What is the relevance of these other matters to Aboriginal affairs?' The relevance is that I do not think there are any senators on the front bench-except for Senator Cook, and I remember some of our clashes over difficult issues-who profess an interest in Aboriginal affairs. I ask Labor senators on the back bench who have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs whether any of them can honestly say that this Government has not behaved shamefully in terms of the promises it has broken to the Aboriginal people. Not one of them could claim that. I remind those who campaigned in the 1983 election of what their campaign literature said they should say to the Aboriginal people. They were to promise them national land rights, and the Australian Democrats guaranteed them the capacity to deliver on that promise. And they broke it because they knew it was not the thing to do and that the Australian people were not going to tolerate it. They backed off. They bought the votes and then refused to pay the price. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the Government's record in Aboriginal affairs. It is a record of perfidy. I believe that for a Minister who has gone through the heat and fire of the recent months in relation to Aboriginal affairs, and who has seen the reasons why we have sent matters to the Privileges Committee, not to exercise the highest standards of care in tabling documents in this place is pathetic. It is a pathetic indictment of this Minister that he did not take the trouble to run a lawyer's eye over that document. It took a second's perusal of that document to see. For the Minister to come in here and say, `I did not check that; I simply relied on the fact that this document was delivered to me' is pathetic. If that is the best defence that the Government can put up, I say that this motion of censure certainly should be carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Cooney said was totally irrelevant. We are not dealing with the integrity of Senator Tate. We are dealing with whether there has been a deliberate attempt by the Minister not to table documents as were ordered by the Committee. The Committee ordered a copy of the record of proceedings of a meeting of Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) senior officers held on 5 September 1988. I believe it was quite justified for Senator Chaney to raise this matter as he has. I believe that that was necessary because of the circumstances surrounding the questions that have not been properly answered following the Estimates Committee's consideration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important that the Government realises that the Senate will not condone any further attempts to hide information in respect of this question. That is why this is so important. Turning to the technical question, the order was that there be laid on the table of the Senate, on or before 5 December 1988, a copy of the record of proceedings of the DAA senior officers' meeting held on 5 September 1988. We happen now to have a copy of that record of proceedings of the DAA and it is before 5 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion by Senator Chaney would have been better moved after the expiration of the date on which the order was required. Certainly, if it were moved then and the document had not been tabled, I would most certainly have voted for the censure motion. The fact is that the motion is premature and that, for whatever reason, the order of the Committee has been complied with in respect of the amendment moved by Senator Chaney. Therefore, I cannot vote for the censure motion, because the order of the Committee has been complied with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (2). Apart from the meetings with defence contractors on 27 March 1987, which was the subject of the honourable senator's Question on Notice No. 288 of 12 April, there is no record of other meetings with American defence contractors by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or his representatives for the purpose of drawing attention to the effects of United States' trading policies on Australia's capacity to purchase weapons. At the Australia-United States Ministerial Talks in June 1987, however, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs made the point very clearly that United States actions have a bearing on our ability to carry out our security commitments and that to the extent that protectionism and agricultural subsidisation impose economic strains on Australia they impair Australia's ability to work effectively with its allies and friends. The Government has, in addition, made a particular effort to have these views registered on the United States Congress.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Officers may become unattached while on maternity leave, while on leave without pay, including for periods of employment in other Commonwealth organisations not staffed under the Public Service Act, or while on long term training and development programs and as a result of organisational change and re-structuring. Since July 1987, 29 Senior Executive Service staff have become unattached as a result of organisational change and re-structuring, and the answers in parts (a) to (e) below relate to these staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 7</PARA>
<PARA> (b) none</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 15</PARA>
<PARA> (d) $55,089 in addition to any entitlements for payments in lieu of recreation and long service leave. As they were deemed to have retired involuntarily, they also received superannuation entitlements in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> Of the 7 SES officers who remain unattached, 1 is on leave without pay, 2 are on sick leave, 2 occupy positions at a higher level pending their permanent filling and 2 are engaged on special project work.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) As mentioned in answer to question 1 there is a number of circumstances where an officer might become unattached. Information on all of these unattachments over the period since July 87 was not collected however it is believed that all officers on being re-attached have been placed at their substantive level or promoted.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 923</PARA>
<PARA> (d) $23,044, in addition to any entitlements for payments in lieu of recreation and long service leave and any superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) This information is not readily available, and I am not willing to devote the considerable resources required to provide an answer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Retraining and redeployment of staff who are excess to departmental requirements is administered in accordance with the APS Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987 or the Guidelines on Redundancy in Australian Government Employment, and administrative instructions issued by the Public Service Commission and Department of Industrial Relations. These provisions provide for excess staff to be considered for vacancies at their substantive level prior to and in isolation from other applicants and on the basis of their ability to perform the duties of the position in question immediately or after a reasonable period of training. This generally takes the form of on the job training which continues until the officer is sufficiently skilled in the duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There has been a net saving of 1034 positions, including 16 SES positions. These are a result of the abolition of positions or the transfer of functions to other organisations.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3421" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) No. In November 1986 the present Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch was formed by combining two other branches which had previously been headed by SFS Level 1 officers. The new branch was, and still is, headed by a SES Level 2 officer. In September 1987 the SES Level 3 position of Special Disarmament Adviser was transferred to another area of the Department as part of the process of restructuring which was required following the amalgamation of the former Departments of Trade anf Foreign Affairs and Promotion Australia and also to give greater priority to assisting Australia's external economic performance by devoting more resources to economic and trade issues.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) There are three ASO8 (formerly Clerical Administrative, Class 11) officers in Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch. One of them, who was particularly experienced in disarmament work was transferred to another branch in August 1987 in order to gain broader Departmental experience and transferred back into the branch in June 1988. During this period he was replaced by an officer who also had experience in the area. Another vacancy caused by the resignation of an ASO8 officer in December 1987 was filled by an officer with little experience in disarmament work but substantial experience in many aspects of the Department's responsibilities, some of which was directly relevant to the work of the branch.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The branch head position was filled in February 1988 by an officer who had no direct experience in the field of disarmament but had wide experience in other areas of the Department's responsibilities. The two section heads who left the branch in 1987 were the two ASO8 officers referred to in (2) above. A third section head was replaced in February 1988 by an officer with substantial experience in disarmament work. Both ASO7 (formerly Clerical Administrative, Class 9) officers have been replaced in the past 12 months; one by an officer who had just completed a UN Disarmament Fellowship and the other by an officer who had no direct experience in disarmament issues. However, another ASO7 officer who has considerable expertise in disarmament work commenced work in the branch in July 1988. It should be noted that since September 1986, the Division in which this Branch is located has been headed by a senior officer with extensive disarmament experience. Changes in staffing of this kind are common in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which is responsible for staffing 88 diplomatic missions overseas as well as central office in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) No. As indicated above several of those who left the Branch were replaced by offices with disarmament experience. In addition, the other officers in the branch had all been there for some time and provided the necessary institutional memory.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) No.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) No. As was stated in reply to those questions, there has been no downgrading of the Government's priorities or activities on disarmament. The changes described above have all been the result of either normal staff rotations which are an inevitable feature of any foreign service or reductions in resources which have been made to all areas of Government activity.</PARA>
