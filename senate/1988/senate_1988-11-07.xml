<TITLE>In-vitro Fertilisation Patients: Medicare Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable The President and members of the Senate in Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare Funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Most retired people have placed money in managed or market linked investments as a hedge against inflation, rather than to avoid the income test on eligibility for the aged pension.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The capital growth on such investments should not therefore be regarded as income.</PARA>
<PARA>3. The decision by the Hawke Labor Government to regard the calculated annual capital growth of such investments as income for determining eligibility for pensions will cause many thousands of retirees to lose their pension thereby causing them extreme hardship.</PARA>
<PARA>4. The decision will be a further disincentive for people to save for their retirement, thereby increasing the longer term cost to the taxpayer of support for the aged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday last, 4 November 1988, Senator Chaney, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Senate on 25 February 1988, raised with me a matter of privilege. The matter raised by Senator Chaney involves the questions of whether false evidence was given to Estimates Committee C in connection with the appearance of certain persons before the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, and whether there was an attempt to slant the evidence placed before the Select Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the resolutions of the Senate I am required to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have precedence over other business, having regard to certain criteria. The criteria refer to the principle that the Senate's powers should be used only where necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and Senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them, and to the existence of any other remedy. The giving of false or misleading evidence before a Senate committee is declared by the resolutions of the Senate to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the matter raised by Senator Chaney, if the facts are found as Senator Chaney suggests, is capable of being regarded by the Senate as a serious matter involving potential substantial obstruction of the Senate, requiring the use of the Senate's powers. There does not appear to be any readily-available other remedy. I therefore conclude that a motion relating to the matter raised by Senator Chaney should have precedence. In accordance with the procedures laid down by the Senate, Senator Chaney may now give a notice of motion which will have precedence over all other business tomorrow. Because the material attached to Senator Chaney's letter may be required for any inquiry into the matters he has raised, I table the letter and attachments.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) notes that the Hawke Government's own advisory body, the Economic Planning and Advisory Committee (EPAC), confirmed in its latest report what the Opposition has claimed for some time, namely, that under Labor, many low income earners face the highest marginal tax rates in Australia's post-war history, that the marginal tax rate for a single taxpayer on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings has increased from 30 per cent in 1983-84 to 40 per cent in 1987-88 and that the interaction of the tax and social security systems results in some taxpayers facing an effective marginal tax rate of over 100 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) concludes that, as a result, many Australians on low to middle incomes are worse off under Labor, with a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and 2 children needing an extra $56 a week in July 1989 to restore their real household disposable incomes to its March 1983 level; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Treasurer seen an article in last Friday's West Australian headlined `Howard switch on gold tax'? Is it the case that the Government will postpone the legislation to remove the exemption from taxation of income from gold mining while it awaits any further representations in relation to this matter from the goldmining lobby, following Mr Howard's indication that he is willing to look at any economically rational case on the goldmining tax?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2082" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the last part of the question, there is of course absolutely no economically rational case for not putting the goldmining industry under the same tax regime as every other industry. In other words, there is absolutely no economically rational case for continuing to allow one industry-the only industry-to have this special easy ride which it has had for the last 60-odd years. I have seen Mr Howard's statement as reported in the West Australian newspaper which is in total contradiction to what Mr Howard said at an investment seminar in New York a month or so ago, when he said that it would be very hard to justify the continued exemption of one section of industry. At that time he was absolutely correct. Last week, under pressure from the goldmining industry and the Western Australian Liberal Party, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I don't have a closed mind on the matter . . . I have said to representatives of the industry that if there is an economically rational case I am prepared to have a look at it. People should not assume that I have a closed mind. I don't like new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In the face of that comment, I find it rather difficult to understand why there is so much dissatisfaction with Mr Howard's leadership of the Liberal Party because he is quite willing to cave in to every pressure group that puts a bit of heat on him. He will agree with anyone who puts a bit of pressure on, so he should be the most popular leader in history. By contrast, the shadow Treasurer said in May of this year on this issue that the Opposition would not be making any recommendation to block the removal of the exemption. To my knowledge he has not deviated from that position. We now have Mr Howard bending with the wind and talking, not in terms of removing an exemption but in terms of a new tax, in other words, delving into newspeak. The Government has already had an inquiry into this matter. Every major goldmining project that has proceeded in the last few years or is now on the books has had factored into its economic viability assessment normal company tax at a rate of 49c, not 39c, in the dollar. These lobbyists-these Western Australian spivs-who have polluted the Australian political process for decades are wasting their time. The timetable will not be delayed. The legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives. It will be passed by the Senate before the end of this calendar year. The Australian Democrats, soft as they may be on a few things, at least have the stomach to stand up to those Western Australian spivs that have polluted Australian politics for decades. It does not matter what the Opposition does about this. The legislation will be passed and the issue will be off the Australian political agenda forever.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill asked me some particular questions concerning the Oasis Hotel at Walgett, particularly the ADC's relationship with the Barwon community. Rather than answer the particularity, I should point out the way in which the Government intends, from this point, to deal with the sorts of questions and allegations that have been made. As was made clear last week by both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister, the Government is adamant in its readiness to investigate fully all allegations of maladministration and impropriety in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. That undertaking is now fleshed out with more administrative machinery to ensure that there is no cover-up whatsoever and to enable the Parliament to be as fully informed as possible. I am now in a position to inform honourable senators that the Government has established mechanisms and a process for investigating allegations which have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The allegations will be investigated in the first instance by the agencies appropriate to them as follows: the Auditor-General has already agreed to undertake a comprehensive audit of the Aboriginal Development Commission and will extend this, as appropriate, into the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The Auditor-General is, of course, fully independent and has powers to conduct a very wide-ranging investigation, particularly in the area of financial administration. The Public Service Commissioner, who is also an independent statutory officer, will investigate those questions concerning personnel management in the Department. I might add that any staff classification issues will be investigated as is appropriate by the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government recognises that certain matters may still require further examination in light of these specialised investigations. The Government has asked Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, a former Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, to make such an inquiry if necessary. He has agreed to do so. I emphasise that the judgment of which matters, if any, would warrant such further examination will be exercised independently by Mr Menzies. Together, these investigations will clearly be able to comprehend all the various allegations made in the report of the Senate Estimates Committee, including the minority part of that report. The approach would be sufficiently broad to pick up other allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> On timing, it is expected that these investigations will be completed in time to enable a statement to be made early in the new year. The approach which is described represents the best means by which an expeditious, thorough investigation can be conducted. There is no need for the more complex and costly processes of a judicial inquiry. Some of the allegations which have been made-and I repeat `allegations'-may be relevant to the former Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Perkins. I wish to make it clear that Mr Perkins will be given every opportunity to put his views on the allegations against him and against the administration of his Department. Pending the outcome, Mr Perkins is an unattached Secretary and is receiving the salary and allowances of his previous office.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2085" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In April this year the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council held a forum on consumer credit. That forum played a rather crucial role in that it raised public awareness of issues concerning not only the extent of consumer overcommitment but also other parallel issues in terms of consumer protection. It also brought together quite a number of people involved in consumer credit from diverse areas. Together at one forum we had representatives of industry, government and consumer organisations. As a consequence, and because of the flow of information at that forum, I think a greater understanding of the problems of each group is now shared by the other groups. The report that Senator Childs refers to is the formal product of that forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the forum there have been a number of major developments in the consumer credit area, and already some of the recommendations of the Council have been acted upon. I think that also underscores the fact that the forum was a major success.</PARA>
<PARA> The major recommendation of the report is an advocation and very strong recommendation that governments in Australia adopt a process to bring about uniform credit laws. At a meeting of State and Federal Ministers held in Melbourne in July of this year we agreed that the concept of uniformity would proceed, that there would be core legislation to cover consumer lending in all areas apart from housing, and that this legislation would apply equally to all credit providers. The legislation is currently being drafted by the Victorian Law Reform Commission and, in a rather progressive step, it will be drafted in plain English. The laws, when finally completed-and I anticipate, given the fact that drafting is proceeding quite speedily, that the draft legislation will be available early next year-should benefit consumers and industry. They will benefit consumers by ensuring comprehensive consumer protection in all States and Territories, and they will benefit industry because they will give it a level playing field, certainty and consistency across the national market.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as the main recommendation for uniform credit laws, the Council also addressed rather extensively the problems of financial counsellors. The Council sees financial counsellors as playing a crucial role in assisting consumers who have been overcommitted in their credit obligations. As a consequence, the Council recommends increased funding. Once again underscoring the success of the forum, since the forum we have been able to bring together both credit providers as well as industry associations, together with consumer organisations, in a working group to discuss consumer financial counsellors. But also a major aspect of the reason that we have brought these three organisations together, including government, has been because of the willingness by industry organisations and groups to indicate a preparedness to provide funding for credit counsellors. That proposal of those organisations has been well worked out by the working group and if it is feasible this Government gladly welcomes it.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, there have been a number of other initiatives that are also part of the report's recommendations. Because of the greater understanding enhanced by the forum we have been able, over the last few months, to bring together by way of a credit reference committee, representatives of both industry and consumer organisations. I think governments have felt that for a long time individual organisations and a number of representative groups have acted in isolation.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government is taking the Council's report seriously. We believe that the forum that was held earlier this year was very timely. It has been a catalyst to improve relationships between all the players in the field.

The overwhelming conclusion of these people has been that the pursuit of economic growth is the basic cause of this problem. Is the pursuit of growth of gross national product (GNP) consistent with a solution to the greenhouse effect and other global environmental problems, or is it a fundamental impediment to a solution to these problems? If growth of the gross national product is consistent with a solution to these problems, would the Minister explain their relatedness?

If they drove they were also adding to the carbon dioxide pollution. If they rode a bike they were adding to carbon dioxide pollution, because they would be exhaling a bit more carbon dioxide than if they were lying at home reading a book.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably right. If I did not have to sit in here listening to sanctimonious humbug, as I did for 2 1/2 hours last Wednesday afternoon, I would not add as much either. Senator Coulter has asked me questions about the Australian national accounts before, and this one indicates that he still does not understand the essential nature of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. I assume he is talking about GDP instead of GNP, because GDP is the measure that is used in Australia. The level of GDP published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is the Bureau's estimate of the quantity of goods and services produced in Australia over a period. It includes goods and services which are sold in market places and valued accordingly. It also includes goods and services which are not sold in the market place using internationally accepted principles and imputes to those a value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point is that GDP includes goods and services, the production of which in some cases involves the emission of significant amounts of carbon dioxide and in others involves negligible amounts of carbon dioxide-that is, those services which are produced by human energy alone. Humans are not great transpirers of carbon dioxide. A given level of GDP would be consistent or compatible with a whole range of carbon dioxide emission levels. A given level of GDP growth could be compatible with either higher levels of carbon dioxide emission, no change levels of carbon dioxide emission, or lower levels of carbon dioxide emission. Likewise, negative growth GDP could occur side by side with increases of carbon dioxide emission.</PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coulter wants to see GDP in Australia fall-and I notice that one of his Australian Democrat colleagues was advocating just that recently-he should realise that that would mean less employment or less productive employment-that is, a lowering of labour productivity, and either way it would mean a reduction in material living standards. Unless, of course, the Democrats want to pursue an alternative solution and reduce population as well, preferably very quickly. If they do, that would not solve the immediate problem. They will have to get rid of some of the people already here if they want to avoid a substantial reduction in average living standards, which would otherwise be the inescapable consequence of a reduction in GDP. I do not think I need say any more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may ask a supplementary question, is the Minister saying that growth of GDP represents an increase in wealth and therefore an increased ability to pay for environmental clean-up, an argument that is often heard? Is he aware that GDP measures the rate at which resources are used up, whether those resources are used for services or the consumption of material resources? Eventually they represent the consumption of material resources, in other words, the throughput, and therefore, by definition, must represent an increase in environmental damage. Secondly, is the Minister not aware that GDP counts as benefits the costs of addressing greenhouse and other environmental problems? If one counts costs as benefits and then claims that one is spending those benefits to address the costs, is this not doubly counting benefits-in other words, counting the same benefits twice, and is this not voodoo economics?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that anybody who is interested in voodoo economics should make a habit of listening to Senator Coulter on a regular basis. The plain fact is that the energy input, if I may put it this way, for GDP output is not a fixed ratio; it is a highly variable ratio. For example, in the case of a painting, some energy might be consumed in weaving or growing the fibre for the canvas and in making the paint-whatever paints are made out of-and a bit of human energy would go into the brush strokes, with the result that some carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere. If somebody wants to value that painting at $1m, that would be much less than, for example, $1m worth of new motor cars, or $1m worth of additional electricity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some conceptual flaws, I believe, in the way GDP is measured, and I am not trying to minimise the possibility that carbon dioxide accumulation could be a problem. One way not of eliminating it but of reducing it which is technically feasible is to switch from fossil fired electricity production to nuclear electricity production. The Democrats give that the big thumbs down as well. But whatever the problems are, I am sure they will not be cured by an infinite number of new class orgies of the type that were conducted over the weekend about this question.</PARA>

That ignores the very high costs which are sometimes associated with video production. In April the Commissioner of Taxation issued two rulings concerning the application of wholesale sales tax to video production and sound recordings. As a result of industry concerns over the possible impact of those rulings, the Commissioner agreed to postpone their date of implementation and invited the industry to forward submissions to him by the end of June. Apparently a number of submissions have been received, and I am advised that an announcement on the outcome of the review will be made shortly. I do not know what the result of the Commissioner's deliberations will be, but it appears at this stage that the sales tax paid by Senator Bishop, for example, on her self-promotional movie-or little horror movie, as I think I heard someone refer to it the other day-will be imposed under the old arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once again, it will be his independent judgment as to what matters will need to be further followed up. If they do find maladministration, that report will be made to the Parliament very early in the autumn session. At that stage the Parliament-given its other inquiries that are taking place, namely, those by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, and so on-will be well placed at the end of those various processes to make an assessment of the impact which Senator Chaney says, and as a matter of logic, would flow from any maladministration that is established.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has the unenviable record of having the highest rate of backyard swimming pool deaths for children under six. It is of great concern to local and State governments and, indeed, to the Australian Consumers Association. The article in the recent Choice magazine showed results of a number of tests relating to the height of swimming pool fences. At present the height is 1.2 metres. It is claimed that the average three-year-old can scale that height of fence if that three-year-old is determined enough to have access to the swimming pool. Of course, I think it is important to say, in talking about the height of swimming pool fences, that nothing can replace parental or adult supervision. It is very important to make that point very clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, around Australia we have differing regulations, some of which rely totally on local government taking the initiative. Of course, many responsible local governments do take that initiative. For the benefit of honourable senators I would like to run through the variations around Australia. The building code of Australia, which is being prepared at the moment, will be looking at a national standard, and it would be hoped that the individual States will take up that recommendation. At the moment State regulations for swimming pool fences are discretionary in New South Wales. Although many local authorities make their own regulations which usually comply with the Australian standard, obviously there are considerable variations. Victoria has compulsory State regulations. The Building Control Act contains regulations which largely comply with the standard but there are limited concessions for private single dwellings. In Queensland again the standard is discretionary, although the Department of Local Government advises adoption of the standard if local authorities choose to make their own regulations. Both Western Australia and South Australia have compulsory regulations. Tasmania does not have regulations. Local authorities do not have power to make their own regulations and I think this is of particular concern. In the Northern Territory, local authorities may make their own regulations. Of course, in the Australian Capital Territory, the Australian Capital Territory Building Manual contains regulations which comply with the standard.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in answer to Senator Giles's question, I think Choice magazine has raised a very legitimate concern. It is timely that this issue should be raised. It is to be hoped that once uniform regulations are recommended, individual State governments will take up this question so that across the nation we will have standards which each State and each local authority will comply with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will take a little time, but I think it is necessary for the Senate to understand the full circumstances in which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs exercised his responsibilities and decided to remove Mr Perkins as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. So therefore I will outline those, and I think that will help to indicate the special circumstances which led to this necessary decision. In the House of Representatives Mr Hand has made certain statements, but I will indicate two of them. On 1 November, in relation to the Woden Town Club, Mr Hand stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am totally opposed to the club being given grant moneys. I would not give a poker machine club one cent of public money. I have told the ADC commissioners that.</PARA>
<PARA>On 3 November he said the following:</PARA>
<PARA>I think my position on the Woden Town Club is well and truly known. I should point out for the benefit of the House that the offer and the documentation of the offer that has been alluded to in the media by the Senate Estimates Committee has never formally been sent to the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> The offer has now been withdrawn and the matter will be reconsidered at the next meeting of the commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA> That was and still is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the House understand the following details relating to the Woden Town Club.</PARA>
<PARA> On October 25 the Woden Town Club was notified by fax that the club would be offered additional financial support from the ADC. The fax said-if I can personify it-that the necessary documents would be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA> On October 26, Mr Andrew Jackomos, the Secretary of the Woden Town Club, told the Minister that this was the first day he had learnt of this supposed offer and he first learnt it when it was raised at the Senate Estimates hearing on the same day.</PARA>
<PARA> From this time onwards, until the morning of Friday, November 4, the Minister was assured by both Mr Jackomos and Mr Perkins that no action had been taken by the club on this faxed document.</PARA>
<PARA> October 31: ADC commission meeting held at the request of the Minister with Mr Perkins present. At that meeting the Minister expressed his opposition to this funding proposal for the club to the commissioners. The Minister then left the meeting having stated his position.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed that the ADC commissioners decided at that meeting to defer implementation of the previous funding decision and consider the matter again at the next meeting to be held in December. The Minister has also been informed that at that meeting the commissioners were informed that the Woden Town Club had not met to discuss the offer.</PARA>
<PARA> During last week and following that meeting of ADC commissioners, the Minister discussed the question of the funding arrangements by the ADC of the Woden Town Club with both the President of the Club, Mr Perkins, and the Secretary of the Club, Mr Jackomos. At no time during the course of those discussions did Mr Perkins inform the Minister that there had been a meeting of the Woden Town Club to discuss the matter of funding.</PARA>
<PARA> On November 3 at approximately 5.40 p.m. the Minister's office received a phone call from an ADC officer to say that two board members of the Woden Town Club had delivered a letter to the ADC in Canberra accepting the supposed offer of additional funding outlined in the faxed letter sent to the Secretary of the club on October 25.</PARA>
<PARA> At 10.15 p.m. on 3 November, the Minister finally managed to contact the Acting General Manager of the ADC, Mr Wyatt, and asked for confirmation of the message he had received earlier that evening. Mr Wyatt confirmed a letter had been received and agreed to the Minister's request to bring a copy of it to his office the next morning. At no stage until the afternoon of Thursday, 3 November, was there any hint that the Woden Town Club had met to consider any supposed offer of support, let alone respond in any positive way.</PARA>
<PARA> On 4 November at 8.45 a.m. Mr Wyatt brought a copy of the letter to the Minister's office. I table and seek leave to incorporate the letter from Mr Andrew Jackomos, Secretary of the Woden Town Club, addressed to the Acting General Manager of the ADC, dated 3 November 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>3 November 1988</PARA>
<PARA>Mr C. Wyatt</PARA>
<PARA>Acting General Manager</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Development Commission</PARA>
<PARA>Bonner House</PARA>
<PARA>WODEN ACT 2606</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Cedric</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the letter of 25 October 1988 from the Acting Branch Manager-Sydney detailing the Commissioners offer to the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Governing Committee, at a properly constituted meeting on 27 October 1988, resolved to accept the Commissions offer of financial assistance. We believe that this now forms a legal and binding agreement between the Corporation and the Commission. Mr Perkins did not attend or take part in the discussions leading to the decision to accept the Commissions offer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation seeks the immediate release of $150,000 loan advance to enable the payment of pressing creditors. With respect to the balance of the offer, the Corporation is prepared to negotiate `down' for presentation at the next Commission meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> We ask the Commission to consider that of the $811,300, provided through either grants, loans or guarantees, our $500,000 has been returned to the Commission through capital improvements to Bonner House. Of the $300,000 guaranteed for the purchase of the poker machines, an approximate $250,000 would be realised on resale.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissions urgent release of the $150,000 is considered urgent with the bad press forcing creditors to take possible action.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter is from the Woden Town Club Secretary and its contents differed significantly from the Minister's belief as to what had been the arrangement between the ADC and the Club, a belief in no way challenged by Mr Jackomos or Mr Perkins at any time until the moment the Minister met with Mr Perkins on Friday, 4 November. At 9 a.m. on that Friday Mr Hand had a meeting with the Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary to whom he gave a copy of the letter and to whom he expressed his deepest reservations as to its implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At 9.15 a.m. the Minister met with Mr Perkins and confronted him with the letter with its statements about accepting an offer and demanding further assistance for the Woden Town Club. The Minister told Mr Perkins that the letter posed enormous problems for their relationship. Mr Perkins, upon being told of the Minister's concern, did not offer any response other than to suggest withdrawing the letter. When the Minister pointed out the improprieties of this idea, Mr Perkins suggested that another letter might be written. Given these circumstances, the Minister indicated to Mr Perkins that he should resign from his position as Acting Commissioner of the ADC. The Minister determined that he could no longer work with Mr Perkins as his Secretary. He left Mr Perkins in no doubt as to that view. It had become clear to the Minister that Mr Perkins was not prepared to give appropriate priority to his position as Secretary to the Department. The Minister then left Mr Perkins in his office and proceeded to see the Prime Minister, where he put his case of not having a good enough basis for a working relationship with Mr Perkins. It was clear from the letter from the Club, of which Mr Perkins was the President, that the contents of the letter were inconsistent with what he had been told by Mr Perkins as President of the Club and as Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister now knows that Mr Perkins had discussed this matter with various people, in particular, on Thursday, 3 November, at the Woden Town Club because Mr Perkins told the Minister so himself. Despite this, and knowing the Minister's strong views on the subject and his statements in the Parliament, Mr Perkins had not informed the Minister until this time. The Minister judged that it was not plausible that Mr Perkins would not have known about the contents of the letter dated 3 November from the Club to the Commission and referring to a meeting of the Club on 27 October. Mr Perkins did not keep the Minister fully informed as would have been reasonably expected on a matter of major current interest and about which he was in a unique position to know. Nor did the Minister judge that Mr Perkins took adequate action, which he was in a unique position to take, to give effect to the Minister's clear position on the financial relationship between the Commission and the Woden Town Club.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Minister's meeting with Mr Perkins, the Minister left his office to speak with the Prime Minister to report to the Prime Minister that because of this incident the Minister could no longer have a good working relationship with Mr Perkins. The established administrative procedures then followed. The Prime Minister set in motion the necessary Public Service actions which led to Mr Perkins discussing his future prospects with the appropriate people. I think that indicates the range of reasons and the sequence of events to do with the special working relationship between a Secretary to a Department and his Minister. It indicates, in a very full way, why Minister Hand made the decisions and recommendations which he did in relation to Mr Perkins. I have quoted to the Senate from a five-page document prepared in the first person for Mr Hand. I seek leave to table that statement and then if in my trying to put it in the third person I have failed--</PARA>

<PARA> Why was Mr Perkins removed from his position as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Speaker</PARA>
<PARA> By way of background, I remind the House of comments, I made in the House on both November 1 and November 3:</PARA>
<PARA> On November the first I said in relation to the Woden Town Club.</PARA>
<PARA> `I am totally opposed to the club being given grant moneys. I would not give a poker machine club one cent of public money. I have told the ADC commissioners that.'</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2094" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of some problems in New South Wales regarding arrangements for primary school sport and some potential problems with the implementation of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. In relation to sport the Commonwealth Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nothing in Division 1 or 2 renders it unlawful to exclude persons of one sex from participation in any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it should be noted that that does not apply to children under the age of 12. That is because the intent of the law was that there should be equality for all children in sport. Obviously that has to extend to administration as well so that we stop the belief growing up that sport belongs to men. In 1986 the directors-general of education in each State got together to decide some common policy on this. They decided that, instead of there being separate boys and girls competitions, there should be an open competition and a girls competition, with the latter being a special measure to maintain positions for girls who may initially be disadvantaged in the open category.</PARA>
<PARA> That was okay, except that when individual directors-general went back to their States, they all had a different interpretation of what that meant. That being the case, the director-general in New South Wales implemented the strategy immediately, without consultation with teachers and with little in-service training. As a result, there has been a significant problem in New South Wales. The single-strategy approach of New South Wales differs markedly from the approach of almost all the other governments, which have taken a somewhat more multifaceted approach to handling the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the problem experienced in New South Wales and some of the other States, I intend to approach the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission asking it to do the following: firstly, to liaise with State commissions to explore that multistrategy approach to which I referred earlier to bring about a gradual and sensitive change to the participation of children in sport; and, secondly, to recommend to the Australian School Sports Council that we seek to develop a nationally agreed plan for primary school sport. The Aussie school sports program has been very successful in increasing the participation rates of both girls and boys in sport around Australia. I hope that by this new measure we will be able to do even better.</PARA>

On 13 October last did the Minister write to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs expressing concern at a number of serious issues which had arisen out of the explanatory notes for 1988-89 of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC)? Has the Minister identified major discrepancies between that document and Budget Paper No. 3, with actual outlays, even at subprogram level, varying by as much as $2m? Is it a fact that despite being allowed an extra week to rectify these serious irregularities, ADC commissioners and officers have displayed what the Minister has charitably chosen to characterise as an indifference to the Government's budgetary requirements? Given this calculated refusal to cooperate with the Department of Finance, what further steps has the Minister taken in recent weeks to sort out the chaotic state of the ADC's financial affairs?

It concerns the actions of the Minister's Department in jeopardising the capacity of this nation to influence the outcome of critical arms control negotiations. In particular, I ask the Minister to confirm whether it is a fact that Public Service officers have warned the Government in writing that the restructuring of the Department has led to a serious erosion of expertise in the Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, so much so that according to departmental documents, the branch is facing a `crisis of loss of expertise'? Is it also a fact that the Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch has lost two senior executive positions, a key arms control expert and six other experts who have been transferred? Is it also a fact that departmental officers have warned the Government in writing that as a result of staff cutbacks the Department, and therefore the Australian Government, is ill-prepared to respond to a number of alarming nuclear developments in South Asia as well as to the growing general threat posed by chemical weapons?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the document from which Senator Macklin was quoting is now fully a year old and that the situation is no longer really as he describes it. The key expert to whom he refers has returned to the Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch. Staff who were new a year ago have now had a year to acquire the necessary expertise, which is rather longer than Ministers get to acquire the expertise to answer silly questions like this. There are now more staff allocated to chemical weapons issues than has been the case ever before. It is the case that consistent with overall resource constraints, with which we are all familiar, there has been some net cutback in this area, but in fact there has been less than in many other vitally important areas of the Department. The fact that the numerical situation has been maintained as it has is a tribute to the importance with which the Government continues to regard this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It needs to be appreciated in talking about staffing issues within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that we have the responsibility for staffing 90-odd Australian embassies and missions overseas. That involves a constant round of staff rotation. The Peace, Arms Control and Disarmament Branch has not suffered disproportionately in that process and within the Branch there has been a reallocation of relative effort, with the greater emphasis being placed on areas of particular concern to Australia and areas of emerging concern, such as chemical weapons.</PARA>

Given that this advertisement appeared in the weekend newspapers, it is interesting to note that the person who is promoting this, a Mr Cambridge, was informed on 12 October that I had refused permission for a performing panda to come to Australia. I informed him again on 3 November that that was the case. I wonder what Mr Cambridge is about, but I think that we might ask Senator Bolkus to find out whether this is false and misleading advertising.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a question from Senator Archer to Senator Cook last week on the subject of fisheries commodities arrangements with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, I am now able to give the following further information on behalf of my colleague Mr Duffy, the Minister for Trade Negotiations, who has the primary carriage of this matter. The response is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In response to proposals made in April 1988 by the Soviet Union, Australia entered into negotiations on fisheries cooperation with the USSR. The proposals include port access for re-supply and maintenance of Soviet fishing vessels; access for Aeroflot charter flights to transfer crews; and research fishing. Officials discussed these proposals in Moscow from 19 to 30 September. During negotiations the Soviet side raised additional proposals, including the possibility of commercial fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) as a matter for discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>It was that latter new proposal to which Mr Duffy was responding in his public statement. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The basis for, and the timing of, a possible resumption of negotiations with the USSR is still being assessed by Ministers. It should be emphasised that negotiations have by no means been completed and as such the terms and conditions that might relate to Australia-USSR fisheries cooperation have not been finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise, however, on Mr Duffy's behalf that Australia will only agree to arrangements which are consistent with Australia's approach to the conservation, management and development of fisheries in the AFZ and which bring benefits to Australia-including, importantly, the commitments that we are seeking from the Soviet Union to enter into long term arrangements for the purchase of a range of agricultural and mineral commodities. Defence and security considerations will be taken fully into account by the Government in coming to a decision on these proposals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 October I was asked a question by Senator Janine Haines on CFS, or chronic fatigue syndrome. I am now in a position to add to my answer on that occasion. The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following information. The Government is aware that such a syndrome has been described. However, it has no firm data relating to its prevalence. It is, though, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, sponsoring a study of chronic fatigue syndrome by Dr Andrew Lloyd at the Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney. While the Government has no details regarding the study being conducted by Dr Martin Donohue and his colleagues, it is prepared to consider any properly conducted and documented report of significance of health issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No formal disposal facilities for hexachlorobenzene are known of in Australia. If high levels of DDT are substantiated in blood samples, the Government presently has no information to confirm such findings. The use of DDT in agriculture has been banned in Australia, and routine government monitoring of the food supply has not identified any particular source of contamination of public health significance.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also raised the issue of pathology tests undertaken to detect chronic fatigue syndrome. The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following information on that score. Overservicing can be determined only by a medical services committee of inquiry constituted under the Health Insurance Act to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the provision of unusually frequent or benefit costly services. Such committees consist of five medical practitioners who take evidence of a clinical nature and report to the Minister on their findings. A practitioner whose services to patients are considered by such a committee is not the subject of any charge but is required to explain that a reason exists for heavy costs on Medicare. It is usual for a medical adviser of the Health Insurance Commission to contact practitioners who could become the subject of referral to such a committee to acquaint them of the principles underlying Medicare and of the possibility of such services becoming subject to on inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> Pathology services of a screening nature do not attract benefit under section 19 (3) of the Health Insurance Act, and the Health Insurance Commission must be satisfied that very large volumes of pathology tests are required for the management of the patient before such claims are approved.</PARA>

In light of the concerns we have, which led to the unanimous decision to make this reference to the Committee, I think it is very important that it is understood outside the Senate that any person with relevant information is entitled to come forward. I say that because I believe that within the bureaucracy there may well be people with very pertinent information who should be encouraged to come forward to make sure that the Parliament gets to the truth of this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I need to bring before the Senate the question of some reports in the media about the considerations, decisions and recommendations made by Senate Estimates Committee E. I refer in particular to one of the reports which appeared in the Melbourne Sun on Friday, 4 November, and which was headlined `Report slams Hand, Perkins'. There are two photographs in that report in the Sun. One photograph of Mr Hand has underneath it the subheadline `Mr Hand . . . ``Lack of discipline'' '. Under the photograph of Mr Charles Perkins it says `Mr Perkins . . . ``Unreliable witness'' '.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reporter, Sue Quinn, then goes on to indicate that the Committee came to a number of decisions and that the findings included the following weaknesses in the administration of either the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). The article said that there were severe conflicts of interest and that Mr Perkins should be stood down pending an investigation into the ADC by the Auditor-General. It said that Mr Perkins had been an unreliable witness during the hearing because of his inability to recall information `of which he should have been aware as departmental head'. The report gives a number of other unglowing viewpoints about Mr Perkins and Mr Hand. The report in the Sun is read, written and presented in such a way that the distinct impression is given that this is a report of the majority findings of Senate Estimates Committee E. That is not the case. None of those findings were made by the majority of the Committee. There is absolutely no cause for this media outlet or any other media outlet to give that impression.</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of Senators Maguire and Foreman and myself, who were members of that Committee, and on behalf of myself as Chairman of the Committee, I believe that the Senate should be made well aware that that minority report, signed by members of the Opposition only, does not constitute a reflection of the viewpoints, as set out in the major report, of the majority of the members of the Committee. I bring this to the attention of the Senate today in the hope that, now that the media have newly discovered what Estimates committees are all about, in the future they will make quite clear the difference between a report of an Estimates committee-and, for that matter, any other committee of the Senate-and reservations put in the report by a minority of the members of that committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing `the serious threat to jobs and the National Estate posed by present logging practices and policies in Tasmania'. The wording could just as well have referred to the present logging practices in most other areas of Australia or in fact the world. We are barely starting to realise the value of the forests of the world at a time when they are disappearing at an increasing rate. In fact, the forests of the world are being mined. It is a mining operation; it is not a forestry operation or a silviculture operation. We are seeing the exploitation of virgin native forests. The Forestry Commission of Tasmania-or anywhere else for that matter, but we are talking about Tasmania today-should take an inventory of any wood to be cut. It should identify the high value timbers. Tasmania especially has some wonderful furniture timbers such as blackwood, celery top pine and huon pine. These fine furniture timbers should be identified as the highest grade timbers. The eucalypt species which are suitable for furniture and saw logs should be identified. All wood should be graded as to its end use. Wood should be graded for use as furniture timber or for saw logs. The most inferior woods should be used as woodchips. That would be the rational way to do it. The highest grade timber should be extracted first and the woodchip timber should be taken last. But that is not the way it happens in Tasmania. It is not the way it happens in many parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the economics of the situation in Tasmania, tree-fellers go in and flatten the forests. Because of the economics of the situation and the concession system, the best eucalypt logs go to the woodchippers. The remainder is often burned on the ground. Sometimes the small sawmillers are allowed to come in and salvage. But often they are not allowed to do this. As a matter of fact, many of them have now gone out of business. So the policies are destroying the jobs and the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> A new awareness of all this has happened in the last few months. A new alliance is being formed because of the realisation that the wood is almost gone. All that is left really is the wood in the National Estate areas and the wilderness areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The most extraordinary thing happened last week in Canberra that I have seen in my 20 years as an environmentalist. I do not know why the media did not take note of the coalition between Ken Bacon, the State Secretary of the Transport Workers Union in Tasmania; Mr Shaun Brooks, the spokesman for the log hauliers executive on the east coast; representatives of the east coast Chamber of Commerce in Tasmania; and Alec Marr, a representative of the Wilderness Society. They were making a plea to Senator Richardson, Senator Cook and anyone else who would listen, for the establishment of a World Heritage area in the south-west to stop a road which would serve another pulp mill. All the representatives of these various generally opposing forces were saying, `The State cannot tolerate another woodchip mill. We do not have the resource and jobs will suffer. Please, do not let Robin Gray ram this down our throats'. That was the message of this group. I hope that this heartfelt message will have an impact upon Senator Richardson, from whom we will hear later in this debate, because there is a realisation at last that commonsense may in fact prevail in Tasmania. This is not the first time that people in the industry have shown their concern. During the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests a number of people made submissions and some of them were actually workers in the industry. I have a letter to Ray Groom, who is the Minister for Forests, which was subsequently, I think, in the Helsham evidence. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I represent the Australian Newsprint Mills Treefellers, who as a group are responsible for the felling and manufacture of over 300,000 M3/annum of timber from the A.N.M.-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian Newsprint Mills-</PARA>
<PARA>concession area. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We are certain that given correct harvesting procedures and pricing structures we can lift production levels of both saw and veneer logs by 50% or 30,000 m3/annual utilising the same amount of resource. I am sure the benefits of this would be immediately obvious to yourself. The situation of A.N.M. being responsible for the harvesting, segregation, and allocation of all timber from the concession is on a par with making Sir Lesley Colin Paterson responsible for security at a distillery. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a greenie, this is a tree-feller; this is a man who represents tree-fellers. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that the delegations from the Tasmanian Timber Industry are not truly representative of the majority of people employed in the industry, but are dominated by self interest groups. The Tasmanian Logging Association (T.L.A.) for example is funded indirectly by companies by a . . . subsidy to their contractors which is then deducted and deposited in the T.L.A. coffers. Huon Forest Products (H.F.P.) would have to be the greatest example of crony-ism since the Marcos Regime in an effort to monopolise the last remaining large stands of sawlog between Messrs. Clennet, Risby, Kemp and A.N.M. without regard to traditional small sawmillers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the secretary of the ANM tree-fellers group. I have a submission from John Greg Reynolds of Karanja, who is a contract tree-feller. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> This submission is made on behalf of 18 Contract Tree Fellers who work in the ANM concession. We are piece-workers and make a living from the quantity of timber we are able to produce. We are concerned that the incentive is on volume production rather than quality recovery. It is not worth our while to take the extra trouble to save quality sawlogs when we can make more money by concentrating on volume without regard to the content of the timber produced. Our main source of income is pulp quality timber. Our experience has shown that we can make more money by concentrating on pulp rather than taking the extra care and time to segregate other classes of timber. Sawlogs and minor species are only a by-product of pulp cutting on our job. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow I am due to start in a stand of high-quality timber with up to six truck lengths in a stem. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that six truckloads of wood come from one tree. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It is very flat even going. I will have to fall all this timber at once over itself. This will result in unavoidable breakages of both pulp and mill timber. If this were cat logged much of this breakage could be avoided. The job I will be doing is cable logging which in my view should not be allowed on flat country like this where conventional logging would not seriously disturb the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>That submission is from a contract tree-feller. I have a submission from another man, Peter Barry Simpson of New Norfolk, who is also a contract tree-feller. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Minor species are deliberately masked in the bush during our operations because of the excessive amount of time required to produce sawlogs and process the logs. With cable logging if you fall big timber first you smash the small stuff and also make some of it too dangerous to fall. If you fall and process the minor species and smaller timber first, it is lying on the ground cut and is likely to be smashed when you fall the big timber. </PARA>
<PARA>That is signed by P. B. Simpson. These people work in the industry and are concerned about what is going on in the industry. What does the industry do? What is it on about? It is on about making money. At the moment it wants to make money with a fourth woodchip mill-Huon Forest Products. Huon Forest Products ownership is: Australian Newsprint Mills, 60 per cent-incidentally, that is News Ltd; Risby, 20 per cent; Kemp, 5 per cent; B. G. Clennet, 5 per cent; W. A. Mackay, 5 per cent; and J. W. Porta, 5 per cent. Risby, Kemp, B. G. Clennet and Mackay were the four sawmillers who set up Triabunna woodchip mill and sold out to North Broken Hill at a massive profit, and now they are trying it again after destroying much of the forest. Because of the bad logging practices of ANM and the smashing of sawlogs in particular, the Premier, Robin Gray, was not game to give the whole of southern Tasmania over to ANM immediately, so these sawmiller partners may stay in the consortium for a few years and then sell out to ANM. </PARA>
<PARA> The man running Huon Forest Products is Steve Balcombe. Steve Balcombe started his career as a hydro-engineer. He was then in the Premier's Department at the time the Huon Forest Products deal was set up. ANM later hired him as a public relations officer and Huon Forest Products made him its general manager. He is now logging manager for ANM, but will also have control over logging operations at Huon Forest Products. He felt moved to write a memorandum to his directors on 16 February 1988. I will read part of it:</PARA>
<PARA> On Sunday, 14 February, DWF and I met with Ray Groom, John James and David Quinn over breakfast at the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo. I had requested the meeting with Groom in order to discuss on an informal basis the issues currently affecting our project. </PARA>
<PARA>Ray Groom, incidentally, is the Minister for Forests in the Tasmanian Government. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Groom indicated that tactics would have to be handled carefully and suggested that the Government would prefer if APM-</PARA>
<PARA>that is Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>and HFP-</PARA>
<PARA>that is Huon Forest Products-</PARA>
<PARA>work out a deal independently for presentation to the State and then the Federal Government. He was concerned about his previous public statements, that additional wood was available to supply APM. He therefore felt that for political reasons any supply proposal would have to include-</PARA>
<PARA>this is for political reasons now-</PARA>
<PARA>a plantation component. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not because of the conservation of wood or anything else, but for political reasons. Honourable senators should look at the collusion. Here is Huon Forest Products getting together with the Minister for Forests and APM and working together to try to get more of the public forests and more of the public land under private control. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I asked him how he saw the whole business of APM, HFP, APPM's-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>Northern Pulpmill and the Helsham business finishing up. He said that he genuinely expected to see both APM and HFP operational and that this was very much in the Government's interest politically in the South. This confirmed my earlier thoughts in this regard. He stressed the political importance of HFP being in operation before the next State election. I said that we knew that we were going to get there in the end but that our Shareholders were becoming increasingly concerned about the extent of the delays and their exposure in this project. Groom understood this and stressed that we must be patient and our perseverence will pay off in the end. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have collusion at the highest level between the State Government and the representatives of the woodchippers, doing everything they can to give away the forests. This is not a forestry Minister trying to rationally use the resource; here is a man trying to give away the trees as rapidly as possible. Australian Newsprint Mills, incidentally, is one of the most wasteful operations in Tasmania. It burns over 50,000 tonnes of timber per year, and that is about 1,000 tonnes per week. The combined environment groups, in their final submission to the Helsham inquiry, estimated that ANM pulped at least 30,000 tonnes of category 1 sawlogs per year. In 1984, ANM pulped 95,000 tonnes of category 1 sawlogs, according to a Forestry Commission survey. Brian Gibson, who is the managing director of Australian Newsprint Mills, in a letter to the Hobart Mercury on 24 November 1983 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>To make ground wood pulp suitable for the manufacture of newsprint, ANM requires old growth eucalypts of the same quality used by sawmillers to produce scantling and framing grade timber. Since this grade of log is not in short supply in Tasmania as a whole, there is no subsequent loss to the sawmilling industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that time many small sawmillers have had to close down. Here is the admission that they use sawlogs, but a denial of the fact that it has any importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Huon Forest Products project will actually cost jobs; it will take timber and it will cost jobs. The Triabunna Log Truck Drivers and Transport Union estimates that 324 jobs will be lost if this project goes ahead. Sixty-five per cent of the Southern Forests in the area recommended for World Heritage listing by the Australian Heritage Commission have been left out of the area protected by Cabinet. Huon Forest Products is designed specifically to destroy all the southern areas that are not in this Cabinet area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson is looking at me with interest. I am sure we will hear his comments. Huon Forest Products is designed to take the forests that Cabinet has decided not to protect. If Huon Forest Products goes ahead, there is no way that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) can honour his promise to protect the National Estate. The proposed road over the Snowy Range through the area that the Prime Minister on national television promised secure protection for must be rejected. If it goes ahead, it will destroy that area. The Southern Forests are already being over-cut by 123,000 tonnes because APM has started up again. But the woodchip operations have not been stopped. Wesley Vale, the new pulp mill in the north, will use 1.8 million tonnes and cost $1 billion to build. That is about as much as Parliament House and all that plant down there will do is munch timber. </PARA>

Has anyone in this chamber ever seen the major timber companies not get what they want? They always get what they want at the expense of the small sawmillers and the forests. The likely scenario is as follows: Premier Robin Gray will build all the proposed projects-Huon Forest Products and Wesley Vale-and will keep Associated Pulp and Paper Mills in the south operating. He will keep the woodchip mills operating. This will result in massive over-cuts. In 10 years, the rotation lengths will be reduced from 90 to 60 years. This will give us enough pulpwood to keep going but will wipe out the sawmilling industry. This is what the sawmillers are concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government cares. In particular, I care. Yes, I was looking at Senator Sanders several times during his contribution mainly because today he is wearing a clean shirt and tie, and a rather nice coat. I was very impressed. I would like to return to the matter of public importance of the day which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The serious threat to jobs and the National Estate posed by present logging practices and policies in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, Senator Sanders did not speak about it. Largely, his speech has been about Huon Forest Products Pty Ltd and whether its plan ought to go ahead. I should begin by making a couple of comments on HFP. The discussions between the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), me, Premier Gray, and his Forests Minister, Mr Groom, after Cabinet had made its decision in the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests, to some extent concerned HFP. It was agreed between the four Ministers that the Tasmanian Government would have to satisfy the Commonwealth as to the adequacy of resources for HFP. At no point in time were the Tasmanians certain that all that resource existed. The calculations given to us at the time by the Premier of Tasmania were obviously still subject to some proving and checking. It is only in the last week that we have had some firm figures on that resource from the Tasmanian Government. It took three or four months to get these figures to us even in what is not yet a finalised form. I have not yet seen the evidence so I am unable to say just what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier informed us that to get the resource that HFP required at the time, many practices had to be improved. These included as an example, the enhanced recovery of small wood. Obviously, in the discussions that we had with the Tasmanian Government, the Cook-Groom package involved improving those practices. As Senator Sanders rightly mentioned, last week there was a very strange delegation from Tasmania which was different from the usual delegation of strange Tasmanians. This delegation comprised representatives of the Transport Workers Union of Australia, of forest workers, of owner-drivers who work for the companies by delivering the logs, as well as representatives of small business. They were united in their opposition to HFP because of the employment consequences in other places. That came as a surprise to me. They drew to my attention the fact-this has not been mentioned so far; it caused me great concern and certainly was not mentioned by either Premier Gray or Mr Groom in conversations I have had with them-that resources would have to be taken away from Tasmanian Pulp and Forest Holdings (TPFH) and Forest Resources to enable the HFP proposal to go ahead. I think that this is pretty worrisome. If HFP is to go ahead it ought to be able to stand on its own. </PARA>
<PARA> It disturbs me that there is now the prospect-I understand it has even been put in writing by the Tasmanian Government-that very substantial reductions in the quotas currently allowed for TPFH and Forest Resources would be taken away. I have yet to take this up with my colleague Senator Cook, but I will certainly be doing that in the next week because it causes me great concern. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth's undertaking on HFP only goes so far as to say that we will be prepared to grant approval for export licences provided it is demonstrated that the resource is there. At this stage that has certainly not been demonstrated. If one looks at what Senator Sanders was supposed to be talking about today, one sees that his actual words were `the serious threat to jobs and the National Estate posed by present logging practices and policies in Tasmania'. The very fact that after the Cabinet decision on the Helsham inquiry there have been such prolonged negotiations with the Tasmanian Government on the prospect of a further agreement on practices suggests that the Tasmanian Government and the industry who have both been involved in those discussions with Senator Cook, acknowledge that there have been problems in past practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, if one were to go through the records of the Helsham inquiry, the evidence that there were problems in past practices is there for all to see. There is a whole range of areas in which forest practice could have been improved and, indeed, should have been improved. The first one I would like to mention is this penchant which the industry has now for cable logging. The purpose of cable logging, as it was first explained to me, was simply to get into areas that were very difficult for access, and it was said that this new technique would provide the access. Yet we discover at the inquiry that one company, Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd, proposed to knock down 60 per cent of the southern forests by cable logging. That is not an area where it is all hard to get at. The fact is that cable logging did provide a cheaper way of doing it, but it really meant cheaper if the company was interested in pulp or chips. It has caused and does cause a great increase in waste. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that if we are to turn the industry over to cable logging in the way that was proposed for the southern forests by at least one company, we are going to increase the amount of waste and obviously decrease the amount of sawlogs, and that is, and must be, a very real consideration. The real scream about the Commonwealth's decision on the Helsham inquiry was what was going to happen to the sawlog industry and what was going to happen to the veneer industry. Yet the same people who are doing the screaming about those two industries are prepared to countenance forest practices which of themselves limit the viability of those industries-but not just the current viability. What they propose to advocate are practices which shorten their life span. </PARA>
<PARA> I love the terms used by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. When it talks about its policy for old growth forests-for `old growth' read `natural forest'-what it proposes to do is liquidate them over 55 years. I love the term `liquidate'. It gives one some idea of the feelings of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission towards the last remaining natural forests in Tasmania. Is it any wonder that the Commonwealth was forced to move to make sure that some of those old growth forests have been protected? As I explained in response to a question here last week, if one looks at what that final response might be, one sees that there is still some time to go-although I hope it is only a matter of days now-before I can announce what the final boundaries of the area to be protected ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing to look at with loss of jobs, if that is what Senator Sanders is complaining about, is that it is not a new thing. There have been thousands of jobs lost in the Tasmanian timber industry in the last two decades. They were not lost because greenies were lying down in front of bulldozers; they were not lost because the nasty Commonwealth came in and stopped people from logging forests. They were lost for two reasons. For a start, the move into woodchips meant fewer jobs. It was always going to mean fewer jobs, and that is how it has turned out. Secondly, improved efficiency in the forests meant that fewer people were needed there. Job numbers had dramatically declined over two decades, and the trend had not stopped. There was no sudden break in the trend, and if any Tasmanian senator can show it to me, I shall be fascinated. There has been no break in that trend; it continued over two decades. Whether or not the Commonwealth had taken the decision it did in respect of the Helsham inquiry, that trend would have continued further. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, having taken the decision we have taken and offering to the Tasmanians a very generous package to help not only in restructuring the industry but also in improving the practices of which we are now speaking, we can give some floor to employment in the industry. We can make sure that those people who have jobs in the industry are able to keep them, and that is a promise that they have not had before. As I said, jobs have been lost for year after year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the elements of the package Mr Groom, the Tasmanian Minister for Forests, and our own Minister for Resources have been looking at. It gives some idea of the real acknowledgment of the problems by both the Tasmanian Government and the industry itself. The industry package which Senator Cook has been looking at includes an upgrading of the forest practices code as its first element. It has got to be upgraded because the current forest practices code just is not good enough. There is also going to be consideration of a bounty for veneer logs to ensure that the stock of wood for the veneer industry is maintained. If one remembers Mr Whish-Wilson and the evidence he gave to the Helsham inquiry, he was able to show pretty conclusively-and I have not yet seen the evidence challenged-that one of the main reasons why there was a waste, and I might say a very significant waste, of veneer logs was that those people actually working in the forest were not paid enough to go to the trouble of separating the veneer logs from the rest. What it has meant is that it is not just rubbish that goes into the chip mills and pulp mills. There is no question that millable timber has been wasted in chip mills and pulp mills in the past, and it is that sort of waste that we have got to stop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is in the distant past, why is it that one of the planks that Senator Cook and Mr Groom have been looking at is the stationing of inspectors at woodchip mills to make sure it does not happen now? The reason is that not even the industry says it never happens; only Senator Watson says that. It does happen from time to time. There is no question that it has got better over the past 12 months. Equally, there is no question that it still sometimes does occur, and it must be watched. Both the Government and the industry acknowledge it, so why cannot Senator Watson?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is only one aspect of the agreement that Mr Groom and Senator Cook are looking at. They are also looking at the greater use of smallwood, as well they might. Premier Gray and the Tasmanian Government, having virtually ignored smallwood for years and years, are now faced with claiming that a significant percentage of the wood that will be used by HFP will come from extra smallwood recovery. The whole industry has had to gear itself up for that because finally-I might say, years too late-they have had to acknowledge what sort of waste has gone on before. Senator Cook and Mr Groom are also looking at the development of more flitch mills, obviously in the end for the same purpose-to make sure we cut down on the waste of millable timber, and it is waste that has been unnecessary and at times outrageous. Anyone who has been to Tasmania and watched what happens after a logging operation has been completed and looks at how much is burnt on the forest floor has to be appalled. One has only to talk to small sawmillers-it does not have to be selected ones-and they will tell one how much is wasted. They say they could make a living from what is wasted on the forest floor but they are prevented from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook's package goes further than that. We have to look at that problem of cable logging; we are going to try to find a strict definition for the ways in which cable logging can be continued in Tasmania. If we get that then, hopefully, we can solve at least some of the problems. There needs to be very substantial encouragement for furniture design in Tasmania to make sure that the craft industries are built up. Again, that is part of the package that Senator Cook is looking at. We must check to make sure that inefficiency and waste are checked at every step along the production line of the forests. That is what we are about now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot hear Senator Watson's interjection. I am sure that it was extremely interesting, but I am in the fortunate position of not being able to hear him. I note that Senator Sanders mentioned Wesley Vale and what should happen or will not happen there. The Commonwealth accepted the environmental impact statement (EIS) on resource for Wesley Vale-I am not sure whether it was prepared in 1984 or 1985. Therefore, the EIS process which has been agreed with the Tasmanian Government, and which takes place as we speak, was undertaken on the basis of looking at the environmental effects of the Wesley Vale Mill itself; not on resource effects, because there had already been an EIS on that point. I can only repeat to Senator Sanders what I have said publicly, which is that at the end of the period, which was extended by one week by Noranda, I will look at the public comments that we have received. I shall deal with those comments as they come in. My Department is conducting a review of the EIS as well. If I am convinced, at the end of the day, that the environmental safeguards are not good enough, I have the option of doing two things: that is, either recommending to my colleagues that extra conditions be placed upon any permission to go ahead or, alternatively, recommending to my colleagues that the development should not go ahead at all. That is what I shall do once I have had the opportunity to have a proper look at this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to go into some of the areas of waste on the forest floor which were not referred to by Senator Sanders. The report of the Helsham Commission was critical, to say the least, of management by the Forestry Commission of Tasmania. It described the forestry administration as `a complex structure of higgledy-piggledy ad hoc institutional arrangements'. My observation of what is happening in Tasmania suggests that that is true. In looking at forest resource planning in Tasmania, the report went on to say that it involved a `maze of assumptions, uncertainties and judgments'. That is one of the real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> When we looked at the Helsham inquiry to try to get a proper Commonwealth response, it was virtually impossible to get accurate resource data because the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, which has been operating in Tasmania for years, was never able to provide the Commonwealth with that information, mainly because it did not have it itself and had to admit so each time we asked. If this was all so efficient and if the answers were all as easy as the Tasmanian Government and many Opposition senators have claimed in the last 12 months, why is it that not even the Tasmanian Forestry Commission can give us any answers? I suspect the reason is that the issues are so complex that an organisation even as big as the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has not had the time to go in and get the data because the pressure has been on it just to manage the cutting. So the planning base for the cutting has never been good enough. If one looks at the revisions of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, particularly in the 1980s, it has to be resoundingly acknowledged that the practices of the 1960s and 1970s were just too hot-even for the Tasmanian Government. It has had to pull back in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government will try to ensure a real future for those in the industry. At all times we have attempted not just to promote employment growth in the economy generally but to make sure that we can achieve that. There will be special enhancements in the Cook-Groom package for plantation forestry, which has to be one of the big answers for Tasmania. I would have liked to have gone into plantation forestry a little deeper, but my time is up. All I can say is that there has been waste. However, let us not look at the past and the waste that we have seen. Let us hope that Senator Cook and Mr Groom come up with a package that ensures that that waste does not go into the future and that jobs can be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a matter of public importance in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The serious threat to jobs and the National Estate posed by present logging practices and policies in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>During his address Senator Sanders ranged widely over a large number of matters concerning the forestry industries, not just those in Tasmania but indeed around the whole of Australia. But it was not until the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) spoke that there was very much focus on actual logging practices and policies which are the alleged basis of Senator Sanders's matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to start by making some comments on the Minister's speech and then saying something about the forest products industry in general, as well as something specifically about the practices undertaken in Tasmania at the moment. I do not believe that the purport of Senator Sanders's matter of public importance was addressed in his opening speech. It was an attempt, once again, to revive a large number of claims about the political situation in Tasmania, the appalling behaviour which he always attributes to the Tasmanian State Government, and a general whinge about the lack of success which his party has had in changing the nature of the debate in Australia, which has now got back to a more substantial debate about the benefits which can be derived for Australia as a nation by the proper application of intelligent principles of forestry management and economic analysis to the timber industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it was even more difficult to work out which side of the debate Senator Richardson was on. By the time that he had concluded speaking only a number of small points of particular relevance had been addressed. The most important of them was, quite clearly, for the Minister to indicate that he does note regard the Wesley Vale development as a foregone conclusion. For all of the great trumpeting which we had from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) just a couple of weeks ago, Senator Richardson was saying suddenly, that, at the end of the day, a significant development, the largest investment in manufacturing industry that has ever been planned in Australia-a billion dollar investment about which everybody could be very happy because it would provide income, jobs and some certainty-may not go ahead. He said, `If I am not satisfied, it may not go ahead'. Despite the fact that there is to be no chance for examination of this immediate proposal through a contemporary environmental impact statement-we are to rely on figures produced for a 1985 study, which I raised with the Minister during the Estimates committee hearings-and despite all of the hype given to this proposal by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Minister for the Environment now says, `Perhaps Wesley Vale will not go ahead anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other points arising from Senator Richardson's speech to which I wish to allude. One was his criticism of the Forest Practices Code, as it is formally called in Tasmania, which he sought to denigrate to a very large extent during this debate while at the same time attempting to have two bob each way by admitting that there have been some substantial improvements in the operation of the timber industry in Tasmania in the last 12 months. The other was simply that he ignored the work which has already been done, and the developments which have already been made, within the craft industries of Tasmania related to forest products. In fact, some 3,500 people in that State are involved in what one might call wood craft operations, and that is likely to increase substantially in the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to say something about the Australian forest products industry in general and I will try to put this within some overall context. The forest product industry straddles both the rural and manufacturing sectors and involves a degree of downstream processing in some areas of the exploitation of the nation's timber resources. The industry is highly concentrated, in the sense that it has a small number of large establishments supplying a diverse range of products which encompass sawn timber, wood panels, woodchips, wood pulp and some paper products. Although ownership is very much concentrated among the large operators, it is also an industry which has an enormous amount of diversity, including regional diversity. For instance, there is a thriving sandalwood industry in Western Australia. Obviously, that tends not to be perceived in the same fashion as forest product industries are perceived in other parts of the country or when we are dealing with other timber resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of forest products in 1986-87 was in the vicinity of $3 billion, just over one per cent of the total output of the Australian economy. As honourable senators would know, there are a large number of alternative plans floating around in terms of public discussion. We have had a document from the Australian Conservation Foundation, which I think is called The Wood or the Trees. That document proposes a series of developments for the maintenance of forest products and the timber industry in Australia. We have had the Forestry and Forest Products Industry Council (FAFPIC) plan calling for $11 billion of capital investment in the industry over the period to 2030, which is also very much tied up with the Wesley Vale development. A number of studies have been undertaken in Australia, including the study by a Finnish company whose name, if I recall it correctly, is Jakko-Porry, which analysed the international competitiveness of the Australian forest products industry, and found that it was in fact very good in terms of international comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a number of claims about the extent of the impact of forest products on the deficit, in terms of claiming that between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion is the shortfall compared with timber and forest product exports from Australia balanced against imports of various forest products, primarily imports of paper, and the necessity of doing something about reducing that element of the trade deficit. It was estimated in a publication by the ANZ Bank in April 1988 that the `industry currently provides jobs for around 250,000 persons directly and indirectly', and that if the FAFPIC proposal were to go ahead, that could rise by perhaps 50 per cent. The statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on this matter show that direct employment in forest industries in 1984-85 was calculated by the ABS at 107,900. So we are not talking about a small industry. It is very often believed, when one is talking about the forest product industry, that it is a small industry and that it is not in the big league of Australian primary products or the manufacturing sector, yet it is. For instance, if we look at an article which appeared in the Business Review Weekly on 21 October 1988, we can see the potential which in alluded to there for international markets in eucalypt pulp, again with some clear indication that this is an area where there is a capacity for an expansion of our activities and for considerable economic benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the immediacy of the co-called forest practices code, which was promulgated in a document put out by the Forestry Commission of Tasmania in March 1987. That code seeks to provide a regime which, in the Commission's words, `is important to care for environmental values during harvesting operations'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Forest Practices Code provides a set of standards to protect environmental values during forest operations. The Code is designed to take a practical approach to the protection of the following environmental values; soils, water quality and flow, site productivity, flora and fauna, landscape, archeology, karst. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to indicate:</PARA>
<PARA> The Code contains policies and practices which have been developed as a result of ongoing research and practical experience over many years. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been a large number of studies in Tasmania about the future development of the timber industry in that State-for example, the study undertaken by the late Senator Everett and Dr Gentle, which drew attention to the importance of private forestry in Australia and the importance of forestry to Tasmania in general. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In a state where one in seven Tasmanians depend on forest-based economic activity for employment, the private forests contribute significantly to the economic welfare of Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA>In a study done by Professor Peter Pearse, the Chairman of the Forest Economics and Policy Research Unit at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, which was produced in September 1987, Professor Pearse makes this point: `. . . the opportunities for development in forestry and the forest industry in the State appear to be very promising'. He goes on to say that he believes that the opportunities are not being fully exploited, and one of the reasons is that forestry on private lands is being, in his words, `artificially suppressed'. So one can see that in Tasmania there is considerable scope for the expansion of forest activities in terms of creating employment, in terms of economic return and in terms of the benefit which will accrue not only to the Tasmanian economy but to the national economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, as with any operation, it is always possible to do better. The Forestry Commission of Tasmania has, over the last five or six years, I think, attempted to lift its act substantially. When I look at, for instance, the document entitled Visual Management System produced in November 1983, I think it would now not be accepted as in any sense the state of the art in forestry practices a mere five years later. If we look at the management plan for the Douglas Apsley region, which came out in December 1987, we can see substantial improvements over that earlier document, the Visual Management System. In the most recent document which I have seen from the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, dated October 1988, entitled Draft Management Plan for Tree Ferns in Tasmania's Crown Forests, I think once again we can see that there has been a continual attempt by the Forestry Commission in Tasmania to upgrade the amount of research and to upgrade the degree of regulation and control which it exercises over the State's forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Tasmanian Government, through the Forestry Commission, has attempted to manage its forests in the most economic and environmentally effective method. I do not in any sense resile from the comment Senator Richardson made that there is scope for improvement. Of course there is scope for improvement. But I believe that to date the basis upon which Senator Sanders has drawn this matter of public importance has not been in any sense adequately established. I believe it is possible for logging and forestry practices in Tasmania to continue to be upgraded in a way which is not a serious threat to jobs and the National Estate, but which provides adequate protection for the National Estate and considerable capacity for expanding employment. Through expanding employment we will be able to improve the living standards of the people of Tasmania and, indeed, all the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Puplick finished by referring to some of the documents which have recently been published in Tasmania relating to the aesthetic and various other characteristics of forestry management because this indicates, as he said, a rapid evolution of that thinking. However, it was distressing that Senator Puplick drew from that point that that very short term view was in any way valid when dealing with matters relating to forestry management and the important biological and aesthetic values which relate to the preservation of those forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth reminding ourselves that we are dealing with a resource which has been around for a very long time. We are dealing with values which were not only important in our own evolution but which will be important throughout the continuing existence of human life on this planet, if we do not damage the planet too much. The period which people like Senator Puplick take as the norm, the period of rapid industrial development which has occurred over the last 150 to 200 years, is a most abnormal period in human evolution and development. It is distressing that Senator Puplick has no sense of a longer term history. Human beings have been around for perhaps six million years, some 400,000 generations. Through most of that time we were gatherers and hunters and we lived in forests. Those are the conditions to which we are biologically adapted and still are adapted. We have been settled in cities for about 400 generations; we have been industrial men and women for about eight generations. That is far too little time to become biologically adapted to these changed circumstances. To suggest that the guideposts that we should use in our management of the environment should be taken from this extremely short period in our history is to misunderstand totally the true nature of biology. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to dwell on for a moment is that in recent times we have become aware of significant changes in environment. This will mean that many of the areas we have set aside for the preservation of genetic diversity will be in the wrong place. Many of our national parks will not be able to continue to preserve those species of plants and animals for which they were set aside. Therefore, it becomes necessary to manage not just the national parks as areas of protection for genetic diversity, but also the whole landscape so that species of animals and plants will be able to migrate as the weather changes. That suggests a totally different view from the view that came from both Senator Richardson and Senator Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made of the loss of jobs, and yet we find that no less a person than Mr Shaun Brooks, from the log hauliers, certainly not a greenie, said that with this Wesley Vale development the number of jobs in his area will drop by 324, yet the replacement will be only 75 jobs. Therefore, the number of jobs consequent on this sort of development will not increase, but rather will decrease according to those intimately associated with those employments.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable overcutting of the forests of Tasmania in the past, a subject which has already been alluded to. One would have hoped that in view of that there would have been a program for reducing the amount of forest that is cut and increasing the value added to those logs which are cut. But that is not what we see when we contemplate the development of a woodchip mill. One cannot imagine a less value added activity in relation to forestry than simply taking trees out of forests and turning them into chips for export. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, has a copy of the submission from Premier Gray in which he proposes to increase the quota for chip exports from Tasmania-and this despite the fact that only three years ago there was an environmental impact statement (EIS) into Tasmania's woodchipping and at that stage the limits which the forests could bear were set. I believe that Premier Gray now says that that EIS, only three years on, is out of date. We have seen a substantial loss of the availability of saw logs. In 1970 one million cubic metres of saw logs were cut; by 1985 that figure was down to 875,000 cubic metres. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the type of logs which can be grown is dealt with by Professor Kirkpatrick, the new head of geography at the University of Tasmania. He draws attention to the impact of woodchipping on the ability to grow mature trees for saw logs. Professor Kirkpatrick says that he fears the remaining private forests will be decimated and the time for forest regeneration cut drastically. He draws attention to the fact that it takes some 80 years for saw logs to be produced, but only about 40 years for maximum growth for pulp. He said on this topic:</PARA>
<PARA> If there is an increased flow of wood, then almost certainly there will be a shortening of the rotation of forests, with the inevitable result that in 80 years we will have no saw logs. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the Tasmanian Government is intent on increasing the cut of Tasmanian forests. For instance, the Launceston Examiner, not a paper remarkable for its pro-environmental stance, said in a recent article:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook confirmed he had received an informal approach from the Tasmanian Government to increase the State's export quota, currently 2.9 million tonnes a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the State's 2.9 million tonne export quota 1.8 million is expected to be taken by the proposed new Wesley Vale mill which leaves 1.1 million tonnes to be shared between Forest Resources and APPM at Long Reach, Tasmanian Pulp and Forest Holdings and HFP. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the allocation of 500,000 tonnes of this remainder to HFP would seriously threaten the viability of Forest Resources and TPFH. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt from the material that is coming out that there has been a substantial desire by the Tasmanian Government to increase the cut, despite the fact that these matters were well researched in an environmental impact statement only three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to deal briefly with a report from two law professors of the University of Oregon who are currently visiting Australia, John Bonine and Michael Axline. They have commented extensively on the inadequacy of the environmental impact statement which has been prepared for the Wesley Vale development-a development which, as has been mentioned several times, involves proposed expenditure of $1,000m. These two American professors of environmental law point out that there will be substantial flows of dioxin-and I think they are referring specifically to the 2,3,7,8 TCDD dioxin, which is known to be extremely toxic-coming from this mill as a consequence of the use of chlorine as a sterilant in the preparation of the pulp. They go on in their report to criticise the environmental impact statement. They say:</PARA>
<PARA> Sentence after sentence in the EIS on toxic effects is simply lifted or paraphrased, without quotation marks, from an advocacy article which appeared in `Scientific American' Magazine in 1986 that argued that dioxin was not a long-term threat. The writer of that article was not a toxicologist but someone who had long worked for an organisation that was funded 60 per cent by the chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS shades even the facts taken from that article. For example, the article admits that TCDD dioxin is probably the most toxic synthetic chemical known to man, `if its acute toxicity to the guinea pig, and even the rat and the mouse, is the criterion'. (the hamster is an exception in this regard.)</PARA>
<PARA>The EIS uses part of the sentence referring to guinea pigs, asserts that guinea pigs are `unusually' susceptible, and omits the reference to tests in rats and mice. The EIS therefore leaves the erroneous impression that the guinea pigs tests are an aberration. </PARA>
<PARA> More disturbing still is the EIS's treatment of evidence on cancer, birth defects, and the like. These should be the primary focus of analysis in the EIS. The EIS mentions such effects in passing, but only to argue that `nobody knows' whether animal experiments are transferable to humans, and that `the evidence available to date suggests they are not'. </PARA>
<PARA>As I hope most honourable senators would know, that is complete nonsense. We regularly use animals in all tests for toxicity and we relate the results of those tests directly to humans. The professors say:</PARA>
<PARA> Such statements are absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS also makes no mention of what other nations in the world are doing about pulp mill dioxins. While the Government of Tasmania pursues this Canadian-owned pulp mill project, Sweden, the world's largest pulp producer, plans `to eliminate the discharge of chlorine (the source of dioxins) entirely' from existing pulp mills, according to its Minister for the Environment. In the United States, the US Environmental Protection Agency aims `to eliminate the presence of dioxin in discharges from pulp and paper mills to the waters of the United States', according to a 1988 policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA>So the EIS in relation to the Wesley Vale development is being put out for public review, with only 20 copies of the EIS being made available and the period for comment being extended for only a single week. The professors state:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government apparently intends to remove all legal appeal rights on the EIS and adopt `fast-track' legislation to set the project in place before the public can ferret out the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not at all unusual. We find that practice occurring with governments all around Australia at present. It is certainly occurring in my home State of South Australia, where the State Government has adopted fast track methods with respect to developments in national parks, urban developments and the like. The two American professors point out that this form of dioxin is an extremely toxic material, and the whole lie of their argument is that the environmental impact statement pays extremely scant attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have in the proposed development of the Wesley Vale pulp mill a proposal which poses very significant environmental hazards for the Tasmanian environment and the Tasmanian people. It almost certainly involves an increase in the cutting of forests, despite the fact that the size of the sustainable cut has previously been set at a much lower figure. Large numbers of people across a wide spectrum of areas are objecting. The trade union people, the local people, the hauliers and the environmental groups in Tasmanian oppose this development and, in addition, we have considerable evidence that this development will lead not to an increase in jobs but to a very substantial decrease in employment in that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the matter of public importance proposed by the Australian Democrats in relation to the present logging practices and policies in Tasmania, which the Democrats have described as a `serious threat to jobs and the National Estate'. It is worthwhile beginning by making clear my personal view about Federal Labor Government policy in this area, to put on record the fact that I believe this Government has done more than any other government in the history of this Commonwealth not only to protect the environment in Tasmania but also to ensure that there are adequate resources available, for example, in the forestry industry, to meet the needs of the future. It has been an intelligent approach, taken within the limits of our constitutional powers. We have not done it lightly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Federal Government has interfered or intervened in the Tasmanian situation, it has done it in many cases in the full knowledge that there would be an electoral backlash in that State. We existed from 1975 to the last election without one Tasmanian House of Representatives seat in the hands of the Australian Labor Party. We knew that the policies adopted with regard to the Franklin dam and the forests in Tasmania could be misconstrued and used politically against us. We knew that the political cost in House of Representatives elections would be particularly great, and it is only recently that the Tasmanian public has come to accept that this Federal Labor Government may well be right in the way it approaches not only the environmental issue but also the question of how best to utilise our natural resources in Tasmania, whether they be potential resources for hydro-electric power or the timber industry in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Government, on the other hand, under Premier Gray, has not taken a similar intelligent or sensitive approach to the environment and resource usage. It has not even been working in the interests of the majority of people who work in or invest in that industry. On too many occasions Tasmanian governments, regardless of political persuasion, have taken decisions which have not been in the long term interests of that island. We can go right back to the Lake Pedder controversy. Not only was a very beautiful area flooded, lost to humankind forever, but also a significant timber resource was flooded without planning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I am not playing political favourites here in any way at all. I believe that all State governments in Tasmania over the years have in many ways been negligent in their responsibilities in the resource and environment area. Lake Pedder was the first example of desecration of the environment and a misuse of resources. The fact that the Hydro-Electric Commission can flood a lake without proper consultation with the Forestry Commission and timber interests and the fact that millions of super feet of Huon pine, the best wood in the world, could be flooded, gives an indication of just how poor the planning was in that time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already said that it was a Labor government. That is why I said I am not playing political favourites. The environment and natural resources and the jobs of Tasmanians come before the future of any political party in our State. It is about time we in this chamber thought about that instead of playing party politics. The issue is much bigger than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Franklin Dam was another resource that the Hydro-Electric Commission wanted to misuse. The Gray Government was overridden, eventually in the High Court of Australia, by the Federal Labor Party. The Federal Labor Party again lost votes because of the stand it took on that issue. The Hydro-Electric Commission has now admitted that not one megawatt of the energy that would have been generated out of that scheme would have been sold. In other words, there was and is no demand for the energy that would have been produced by the proposed scheme. So, again, the Federal Labor Government in this case was vindicated in taking a hard stand in the interests not only of Tasmanians but of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Gray has been involved in a number of deals with regard to the allocation of forest resources in Tasmania. I will not name them at this stage because some are part of considerations that are before this Federal Government at the moment. It is fairly obvious to me and to most reasonably aware onlookers that the Gray Government is playing political favourites in the allocation of forest resources in Tasmania. That issue will be examined by this Government when proposals come before it. One would assume, in fact, I have confidence, that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, will give appropriate advice to Cabinet and Cabinet will take appropriate action about those proposals coming before us from Premier Gray. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally, one does not relish the idea of Canberra being the fount of all wisdom. The Tasmanian Government simply has not lived up to its responsbilities not only in this area but, as I indicated before, also in the area of the production of energy in Tasmania. Significant criticisms have been made of the way the Tasmanian Government has handled its forests. For example, the Helsham Lemonthyme and Southern Forests Commission of Inquiry heard evidence that indicated that there had been a significant waste of timber resource in that State, that large quantities of felled timber had been left on the forest floor to rot or be burned and that a significant quantity of saw log quality timber had been used as pulp wood despite the claims of the Tasmanian Government that the industry is `saw log driven'. This has been a contentious issue for many years. It was aired in the Tasmanian Legislative Council Select Committee on State Forestry in 1985. Things are still not getting better down there. A number of the Commonwealth industry incentives flowing from the Helsham inquiry address these issues. We are looking forward to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of cable logging in conditions which do not warrant it may lead to the smashing of saw log quality timber, rendering it useful only for pulp. Many people who have been working in the industry have testified to that gross neglectful practice. The Tasmanian Government needs to come clean on whether it intends the industry to be geared to the highest value-added processes. As a first step, it would seem that a total review of current logging practices is necessary. This Government is not denying that. We are doing what we can, within our constitutional rights and powers, to ensure that that does happen. The Helsham inquiry also noted:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Forestry Commission were directed to sell the current quantities of timber at the best royalties it could get, the rates it could get for the same volumes of sales would be substantially greater for all categories of timbers.</PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at most of the reports that have been written about the forestry industry in Tasmania and forest practices, one will see that there is a great deal missing by way of intelligent management. That is because on the whole, particularly since the Gray Government has been in office, there has been significant intervention in that process of making decisions about the allocation and utilisation of resources. That intervention has come primarily from Premier Gray over the top of the Commission which was established to ensure, firstly, that the environment was protected; secondly, that those natural resources were used in the most effective way for the benefit of all Tasmanians and for all Australians; and, thirdly, that the Commission was set up to pay its own way. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, none of those three requirements have been met by the activities of the Forestry Commission-not because of the way the Commission operates per se but because of the political interference that has existed over the years under all State governments, but most certainly under the Gray Government. That has been a complaint made not only by environmentalists and Federal Labor Party politicians but also by many management groups in the industry. They see favourites being played through the political processes. We cannot develop a forestry industry and protect our environment in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The record in Tasmania is not a good one. The Federal Government does not intervene willy-nilly or wantonly in these issues. We know that community attitudes right around Australia are changing. Ordinary people both within the industry and outside it, and in Tasmania and on the mainland, recognise that something has to be done. That something is to plan in the long term. It is to ensure that we get the best out of that wonderful resource that Tasmania has been blessed with and at the same time to protect that environment which is unique. That is the reason why I live in Tasmania. It is the reason why many people have come back to Tasmania after living overseas at different times, particularly people who have had career opportunities elsewhere. They choose to live in Tasmania for particular reasons related to the environment and the lifestyle there. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not intervening unilaterally. We are intervening as a Federal Government in cooperation, where possible, with elements of industry in Tasmania and, in particular, with the State Government. The forest accord which was negotiated between Senator Cook and the Tasmanian Minister for Forests, Ray Groom, is one example. The dam compensation money-the $300m or so-which was used to offset supposed losses from the High Court of Australia decision about the Franklin dam, was agreed between the two governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the other group that is rarely mentioned is the group represented in the trade union movement, that is, the workers in the industry. They are perfectly aware of the abuses which go on in Tasmanian forests. They are perfectly aware of the favouritism which is played by the State Liberal Government. They are perfectly aware that their jobs have been going down the chute steadily over the past decade through misallocation of resources, underutilisation of our resource and poor planning in the long term. They are perfectly aware that, when the woodchip industry in Tasmania was established in the late 1960s and the contracts signed for them, the Forestry Commission-that was the one commission that had responsibility for this particular area-had no accurate idea of what sort of resource we were selling to the Japanese and to others. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a national disgrace that a commission that had that responsibility could suddenly turn around nearly a decade after those agreements were signed and say, `We have a problem. We have discovered now that the resources are not going to meet the contracts that we signed'. As everyone knows, already there has been one major reallocation-or, more particularly, a reduction in allocations to the various companies. If that particular failure of the Forestry Commission-and of the Government at the time to persuade it in the appropriate way-is so obvious, then surely we should be learning from our mistakes at that time and making sure that we do not repeat them. This Federal Government is determined that it will not repeat those mistakes. Senator Richardson is not known as a man who is naive about where votes flow or what the numbers are about in politics. Yet he is determined to ensure that, despite temporary setbacks in terms of our electoral position in Tasmania that have occurred over the past decade, we as a Federal Government will continue to push this issue so that the Tasmanian Government finally reflects changing community attitudes and finally starts to consider what the future is all about in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about just forestry practice here. Senator Sanders is perfectly capable of pushing his own political barrow in this area. The Australian Democrats have to survive as a political party. They cannot give credit to a Labor Government which has stood up courageously and lost seats for an issue. </PARA>

The whole ecosystem needs study and care in handling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, quite a few interjections are coming from my left hand side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) went to great lengths to discredit the Huon Forest Products project, as did other speakers. I would just like to point out that the Huon Forest Products project will not result in job losses nor reduce resource allocations at Tasmanian Pulp and Forest Holdings Ltd or the Forest Resources Longreach Mill as the Transport Workers Union claimed to the Minister that it would. In fact, the material is going to come from the southern concession and the Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd (ANM) concession from previously untapped resources. Huon Forest Products will be using material that was previously burned. If the Huon Forest Products project does not proceed 330,000 tonnes of pulp a year will have to be transported through Hobart to mills at Triabunna and northern Tasmania. I can imagine the uproar that will come from people because of damage to roads and historic buildings, the threat to road safety and all the rest of it. It has been well and truly researched that the material for the project at Huon will come from local concessions. If the project does go ahead-and I hope it does-not only will it create many more jobs in the area but also there will be a more economic use of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's matter of public importance commences with the words `the serious threat to jobs and the National Estate'. Until now, the only time that jobs have been mentioned in the whole debate was when Senator Coulter briefly mentioned that somebody called Shaun Brooks had stated that 352 jobs were to be lost and replaced by 75 at the Wesley Vale project. If we are to discuss a matter of public importance about the importance of jobs and logging in Tasmania, I think we should get on with it and present a few facts. Forest based industries in Tasmania employed something like 6,800 people, excluding the contractors, in 1982. They also indirectly employed another 17,000 workers. The woodchip export industry also employed 400 people and indirectly employed another 4,000. It was interesting to hear the Minister comment in his speech that there has been a large loss of jobs over the years in the timber industry. Of course, everybody recognises that. This has happened because of rationalisation in the industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Aulich, for the interjection. I am not saying that it is a misuse of the resource at all. I presume that the honourable senator has had a look at these areas. Senator Brownhill and I have been to the Southern Forests. I have had the opportunity with my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Archer to visit chipmills. I am very impressed at the moment with the way in which resources are being utilised in the Southern Forests. Everything that can be used is being used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of criticism today by the Minister and others of clear felling, the shocking mess that it makes and the blot on the environment. I must admit that to anyone who does not understand the process, at first sight clear felling is rather mind boggling to say the least. But the area is burned after all the resources are taken and everything is used economically. I do not have to go into all of the details about sustainable yield, but I was very impressed by what is done in the Southern Forests area on the advice of the Forestry Commission. The industry uses what is called a hot fire in which everything that is left on the ground is burned. This is most important in the re-generation process. If anybody needed any evidence, Jonathon West, a former Director of the Wilderness Society, and Janet Rice, Vice-President of the Conservation Council of Victoria, agree that fire and clear felling are necessary and there are sound environmental reasons for using the silviculture technique. This technique has been criticised in Tasmania. But it has big advantages in Tasmania in terms of regeneration and it has been acknowledged by the Australian Conservation Foundation Director Phillip Toyne himself. He said that one would have to be an expert scientist to distinguish between logging re-growth forests and perfectly natural fire regrowth forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Fire has been part of the forestry process for as long as man has been on earth. Senator Coulter mentioned that people have been on this planet for six million years. When we talk about the waste of the resource in Tasmania, one needs only to be reminded of the 200,000 plus hectares of ash that was burnt in 1939 on Black Friday. That volume of timber would have supplied Victoria for something like 80 years. So we do not need reminding of the damage that is done by fire. Why should clear felling be criticised when this practice is making very good use of what we have?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to what this matter of public importance is supposed to be about-and that is jobs. </PARA>

It has also been said that the new lightweight coated paper producing techniques at ANM at Boyer will produce another 270 jobs. If and when the Huon Forest Products project goes ahead, using the resource in the Huon, up to another 590 jobs could be created. So regardless of the criticism--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is for the Wesley Vale, Boyer and HFP combined. There are 1,200 jobs in total. Taking into account the relocation and some job losses in woodchipping and whatever, it is estimated that there will be around 700 direct jobs. Getting back to the question at hand-the so-called crisis in Tasmania because of the policies of the Government down there-as I have just demonstrated, the new timber-related industries in the pipeline will directly involve 700 new jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the future developments that are happening and the actual investment in money terms rather than in job terms. The lightweight coated paper project at Boyer is worth in the vicinity of $350m; also at Boyer the upgrading of the newsprint mill is another $92m. The Australian Veneers Pty Ltd manufacturing which is in the pipeline at the moment, is worth $1m; the Wesley Vale project, which has already been mentioned, $1 billion; the Burnie Timber's veneer particle board upgrading, $1.9m; Huon Forest Products could be up to $45m; and various sawmilling investments, something like $12m. These projects are all in the pipeline at the moment. As well as that, they will improve Australia's annual trade balance by an estimated $550m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Australian Democrats have departed from the chamber. I might add that when a quorum was called on Senator Sanders only two of them turned up to support him. Not one of them is in the chamber at the moment. After raising this matter of public importance and making such a song and dance about it, there is not one Australian Democrat here. With due credit to the Government, at least the Tasmanian senators are here to listen. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to the subject, these projects will improve Australia's annual trade balance by an estimated $550m per annum, not to mention $1.5 billion of investment in Tasmania. As well as that we have direct construction jobs. When all this work is being undertaken at the Wesley Vale mill we will have 800 jobs on average for these years; at Boyer we will have 300 jobs on average for two years; and at Huon Forest Projects, Whale Point, we will have 200 jobs for 12 months or so. Because of these projects in the pipeline the lift in employment in Tasmania is very significant. I think even the Tasmanian senators on the other side of the House would have to agree with that. For the Democrats to bring this matter of public importance on today to try to make out that the Government's policy in Tasmania is costing jobs is absolutely ridiculous. As I said before, it is typical of the attacks that particularly Senator Sanders has been making on Tasmania over the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the threat to the National Estate is concerned, if anybody needed any evidence about what is happening in Tasmania, he has only to look at the history of what has been going on over the last few years. We have had 11 public inquiries into forestry matters in Tasmania. I note that Senator Sanders has returned to the chamber. As Senator Puplick stated earlier, those 11 public inquiries resulted in the first comprehensive forest practices code, and it is acknowledged as one of the best codes in Australia. Every hectare of Crown forest logged is replaced with forest and the State forest is managed as a sustainable long term resource. We do not need to talk about the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. I think all Tasmanians know about that. The fact of the matter is that the people concerned said that they were going to abide by the umpire's decision and when the umpire gave his decision that did not suit the Government, so henceforth we have had the Minister procrastinating about what he really is going to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the arrangement, I will be brief in my comments. Here we are, a gaggle of Tasmanian senators arguing about forestry yet again. Something like 18 months ago I commented that Tasmanians and perhaps all Australians were sick of the forestry argument being front-page news. I suspect that that is still true, perhaps even more so. I find it sometimes embarrassing that the situation in Tasmania and the activities of the State Government there continue to be exposed, because the situation ought to be better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Federal Ministers-the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook)-are trying to bring about a more sane and balanced timber industry in Tasmania. Each of those Ministers has probably spent as much time in Tasmania in the last year or so as they have at their own homes, negotiating in Tasmania, consulting and trying to get a suitable outcome to the whole argument about the use of Tasmanian resources. I think it is important that that effort should be recognised. I reject the allegations that there is some blundering Federal interference. There are Federal responsibilities which those Ministers are trying to carry out in a very effective way. At the same time we emphasise that the timber industry is important to Tasmania. No-one is suggesting that it will or should disappear. Just because one questions some of the practices of that industry, of course it does not mean that there is some total opposition to the industry, as has been alleged in the past. But unfortunately there are sections of the industry and the Tasmanian Government which cannot help themselves and repeatedly bring embarrassment to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gray may have softened his image a little recently, but he still has a `develop at all costs' mentality rather than the more balanced outlook that we would prefer. Senator Puplick, in his remarks, might have tried to put a gloss on the Federal Opposition's policies, but I am afraid it does not hide the overall lack of concern on that side of the chamber for some of these important environmental issues which are difficult to sort out. We saw in Sydney at the weekend the view that the New South Wales Liberal Party had of Senator Puplick on environmental issues by dropping him down its Senate ticket for the next election. I emphasise that the Commonwealth has rights, responsibilities and obligations under the Constitution and under Federal laws to intervene where appropriate in State activities. We cannot just have a situation where intervention in State matters is welcomed provided it is on issues that those opposite support. </PARA>
<PARA> To deal with some of the problems with the timber industry in this matter of public importance that Senator Sanders has raised, it is clear that the timber industry must clean up its act and behave more responsibly in using the resources. Management practices must be improved. To argue that they have improved in recent years compared to how they were in past years does not answer the problem. That is no answer to the suggestion that there are still problems in forest practices. The Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests was critical of the industry's forest practices. It said that too many saw logs were being chipped; that there was inadequate inspection and supervision which led to wasteful practices in the forests; that the system of payment to log fellers encouraged them to go for only the larger trees; that smaller trees were not collected and were often burned; that the minor species-those beautiful timbers of blackwood, huon pine and sassafras and so on-were also being burned; and that, therefore, the furniture industry and the craft industry were not getting as much of those species as they should. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in this building should appreciate-now, even if they did not before-the beautiful Tasmanian timbers that can provide so much value and employment in Tasmania because Tasmania has produced so much of the beautiful furniture for the new Parliament House. There has been overcutting and soil degradation because of some of the forestry practices. There has been an exaggeration of the requirements of the industry for timber resources. Even the industry itself has, from time to time, admitted that it could improve its practices. The concession system is partly to blame for this. There is talk that that perhaps ought to be changed as well. Even if there has been a comparatively improved record in recent years compared to the even more appalling forestry practices in the past, there is still a long way to go in improving the situation and modifying the loss of jobs that there has been over the years in the Tasmanian timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Great doubt remains as to whether the resource is sufficient for a sustainable yield to provide timber for all these promised investments that Senator Calvert outlined. There is no guarantee of the sorts of numbers of jobs that he is claiming in those investments, even if they go ahead. There has been a lot of puff and exaggeration about many of these projects. It reminds me of the promised expansion of industry in Tasmania, the new investments, the jobs and so forth at the time of the argument about the damming of the Franklin River. People said that if that river were not dammed there would be so much greater unemployment. They said, `If it is, there will be this industry expansion and the other industry expansion and won't it all be wonderful'. There has been no indication of the need for that power. </PARA>
<PARA> We also heard the wild assertions from Senator Calvert about the multiplier being used for the indirect employment from some of these new proposals. There has been a lot of scaremongering of forestry industry workers over the years by the Tasmanian Government. I am now pleased to see that many of them see through that propaganda and are more realistic about the situation. That is one thing that can be said about the current forestry debate compared to how it was 18 months or more ago when the Helsham inquiry was set up. </PARA>

They cry centralism, socialism and all the rest of it. But the fact is that the Federal Government has a responsibility to involve itself where its constitutional responsibilities lie. The Federal Government has to approve exports. We cannot close our eyes to the environmental involvement of the industries concerned with those exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer very briefly to a couple of the projects that have been talked about. Wesley Vale for instance, ought to be welcomed as an increase in the downstream process; that is, of producing pulp rather than chips. One has yet to be convinced that it will replace chipping; that is, it can be suggested that it might involve using more of the timber resource. Apart from that issue of whether there is enough resource and how it will be reorganised within the State, there is also the question of the location and the process. I was pleased to hear Senator Richardson emphasise that if he were not convinced about environmental issues he would recommend non-approval by the Federal Government or at the very least impose conditions on the project which, of course, depending on those conditions, may make it uneconomical. </PARA>
<PARA> I must confess I have not seen the environmental impact statement, but I have seen many comments about its inadequacies. Senator Coulter, in particular, made some comments about the dioxins that will be produced. Obviously, there is a lot of local concern about the Huon Forest Products Pty Ltd project from other areas such as Triabunna and the transport workers. There are worries about environmental resource and jobs. In conclusion, to allow Senator Watson time to make his comments, I emphasise that the forest practice is not just a Tasmanian domestic affair. This Government should not countenance the sort of overcutting and waste which has occurred. I am afraid that Senator Watson, Senator Calvert and others will just have to put up with the proper involvement of the Federal Government in Tasmanian forest practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coates for allowing me some time to participate in this debate. In the limited time available, I wish to refute the misleading and extravagant claims made by Senator Sanders and Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats. When an important matter such as this matter of public importance is raised by a party, one would think that the party could be well represented in the chamber. In fact, in large sections of this debate, not even one member of the Democrats was in this chamber. If this matter were of importance, one would think that Senator Sanders would have at least addressed the serious threat to jobs. Only Senator Coulter seemed to put any store on that. True, it was in the matter of public importance, but why did Senator Sanders not address the issue of the matter of public importance? In fact, it is in the first line and he hardly addressed it. Only one of the Democrats speakers drew a passing reference to it. Had Senator Sanders posed this question about 12 years ago, it might have had some relevance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, he has again failed to bring himself up to date. He seems to be quite unaware-perhaps deliberately-of the progress made not only by the Tasmanian Government and by the Forestry Commission but also by the companies themselves. Only last week one company-Forest Resources-opened a new research station in Winkleigh in northern Tasmania. Things are happening all the time. There is quite a deal of progress in minimising environmental damage as a result of logging operations. One looks at the Forest Practices Act proclaimed in 1987. The Democrats failed to mention this. They failed to mention a number of other initiatives which are designed to improve forest practices and minimise damage to the environment. Senator Sanders suggests that the present logging practices and policies in Tasmania lead to a serious threat to jobs in the National Estate. That was in his matter of public importance but not in his speech. My response to this is that the present practices and policies referred to pose a threat to neither the jobs nor the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, we concede that over the past few years there has been a drop in the numbers employed in the forest operations. I strongly reject the suggestion that this is the result of the present policies and practices in Tasmania. The majority of job losses are a direct result of rationalisation and the application of high technology, machinery and modern practices. I believe that the present logging practices and policies do not threaten the National Estate. Many initiatives have been taken, not only by the State Government but also by the Federal Government, to overcome and improve the situation. Certainly in the distant past logging practices and policies may have caused some problems, and I accept that criticism, but I commend the State Government for what it has done in making progress towards improving forest practices and policies, and also because it acted quite responsibly in pushing for a higher royalty rate in its negotiations for the Wesley Vale project, even though that delayed the announcement of the scheme. This was a responsible attitude to ensure that the highest possible royalty rates were obtained from this major development in our State. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of Senator Sanders about the loss of jobs-and I must say it is a new found concern; it was not evident a few years ago-indicates that even he would not have been in agreement with rapid changes in logging practices and policies as a consequence of a reduction in the work force. What we are seeing in Tasmania is a progressive and gradual evolution in practices and policies with minimum disruption to the industry. If we look at the structure at the present time, it is clear that there can be no taking of timber from private land for chipping purposes unless that adheres to a strict management plan. In fact, no woodchip company now is allowed to accept timber from private forestry unless that area is regenerated. It is said that in a few years' time the whole of the resource is going to come from replaced species and not from new Crown reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads the Helsham report carefully one will note that there are a number of forestry companies that take 100 per cent of their resources from regenerated timber. Considering the size of the State, 47 per cent of the island is forested and 23 per cent of the forests are privately owned, compared with only about 4 per cent of the Australian continent which is forested. This means that over one-third of the total available wood resource is in private forests. The Forestry Commission is aiming to achieve a sustainable level of timber harvest by endeavouring to bring about an improvement in utilisation and reafforestation on private land. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, Forest Resources was obliged to reafforest 2,000 hectares per year prior to 1986. From 1986 onwards the export chip companies have been required to reafforest five hectares for every 1,000 tonnes logged on private land. This is in line with the policy that no woodchip logs may be cut from private land unless there is an undertaking that that land will be reafforested in line with a strict and responsible management plan. That puts an end, surely, to the claim by Senator Sanders about irresponsible policies. The Government has attempted to remove disincentives and obstacles to private forestry practices. It has adopted a very responsible position. A private forestry council has been established with statutory power to appoint special committees, and the council provides various incentives for private forestry development comprising loans and grants. A separate division has been established within the Forestry Commission, called the Private Forestry Division, to administer the legislation and to promote the development of private forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Senator Sanders suggests the majority of wood cut in Tasmania goes to pulping and woodchipping operations, may I highlight a significant woodcraft industry in addition to the furniture manufacturing industry which is also dependent on timber. Woodcraft has developed over the last 20 years into the largest sector of Tasmania's prestige craft economy. There are almost 70 full time and probably about 200 part time woodcraft workers in Tasmania in addition to the 3,500 people whose hobby is woodcraft, and they sell some of their work. In fact, a highly commended course has started at the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology under Mr Tim Hull, and this is a further manifestation of progress in the education area for woodcraft skills. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that I found the response of the Government somewhat disappointing. It did seem to me to be somewhat superficial. The two principal recommendations that were made by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority concerned, firstly, the question of investigative teams to ensure that greater recognition was given to involvement by experienced police officers, and the response of the Government was that it would pay close attention to that recommendation. That does not advance us much further. The second recommendation concerned our advice that a senior and respected serving or former serving police officer should be included as a member of the authority. What the Government said in relation to that recommendation was that it would bear in mind the Committee's recommendations. So we really do not know whether or not the Government is accepting the recommendations that were made by the Committee, and that is disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> The report by the Committee on its initial evaluation of the National Crime Authority (NCA) has been an interesting exercise. It has been particularly interesting for me, as was the response I received when I spoke on the initial report in, I thought, very moderate and reasoned terms. I spoke of the difficulties that were experienced by the NCA, particularly in dealing with certain of the police forces in Australia, especially in Queensland, where the liaison officer had already been shown to be corrupt; and of experiences that may have occurred in the past with New South Wales. I said that, regrettably, South Australia was not exempt from this situation. I had in mind that at the time there was the pending trial of the former chief of the Drug Squad in South Australia, Detective Moyes. Details of that matter were under suppression in South Australia, and I was not going to say anything that would prejudice the consideration of that case. But in reply to my simply speaking in such reasoned and concerned terms, I was subject to an incredible tirade of abuse, firstly from the State Government and then from the police association; even the Police Commissioner called a press conference, and that was particularly disappointing. The newspaper editorials then entered the fray. My hands were tied behind my back because I was not going to say anything that would be irresponsible and could put that trial into question. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government and its colleagues was saying was, `Put up or shut up'. That was disappointing when the Government and the police force of South Australia knew all that I knew and therefore had the total information before them. I thought their handling of that matter was intolerable. We should be able to expect more of the South Australian Government. From then on, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, we have had enormous difficulty in getting the Government of South Australia to face up to its responsibility in relation to organised crime and official corruption in South Australia. Firstly, the Government proposed to introduce an anti-corruption body within the police force, some outside influence which was clearly going to be ineffective. Then the Government said that it would set up an office of the NCA, as I had advocated from the beginning, and that was pleasing in the first instance. But then it seems from what the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who I am pleased to see is in the chamber, said in the Estimates Committee that the Government was looking at a downgraded version of the NCA that would be headed up by senior counsel rather than a member of the Authority. Finally the Government said it would be headed by a member of the Authority and that the Government would provide it with staff and resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to hear that, but still the State Government is not bringing us fully into the picture. It will not tell State Parliament what references it will be given, and it will be effective only if it is given adequate resources. I find it a matter of great regret that the South Australian Government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the situation that has now been reached. An NCA office in South Australia can be very useful as a deterrent to organised crime and in countering official corruption as it has facilitated organised crime in South Australia. The Committee will continue with its responsibility of investigating the NCA's handling of the Grassby matter and the Harvey matter which arose in South Australia. It is important that we are able to assure the Senate that the NCA is carrying out its functions in the best interests of law enforcement in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government seems to have approached the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on this matter much more positively than it did the Committee's evaluation report. The Government accepts that the Australian Federal Police should assume the national witness protection role, which the Committee has recommended, and I am pleased that it has been prepared to accept that recommendation. The matter of witness protection is a difficult one. Sensitivities are involved and generally it involves the protection of accomplices-the protection of criminals. Therefore, not surprisingly, some in the community find concern with it. However, it has been shown to be one of the effective tools-perhaps one of the few effective tools-in combating serious crime in this country. The Committee came to that conclusion and felt that it was important to develop a proper protection regime in Australia that could be coordinated throughout Australia and which could better facilitate this country's law enforcement bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I said when the Committee report was put down that we were most impressed with the Australian Federal Police officers for the way in which they approached this task. It was not only a dangerous task but also, as I indicated, it meant protection of those whom they had been trained in the past to apprehend. Psychologically that is not an easy thing for a police officer to do. However, they recognised that in doing so they were being part of a chain that would help reduce the unacceptable level of organised crime and official corruption which exists in this country. I am pleased that the Government has accepted the recommendation. I am pleased that the Government, therefore, has been prepared to endorse the work being done by the Australian Federal Police in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this will be only a start and that the Government will properly recognise that what is necessary now is to put into being laws in both the Commonwealth and the States that will adequately protect such witnesses when their work for the state is done and they cease to be required as witnesses. Obviously, in our society it is inhumane to throw them back into an environment where they will be subjected to either death or physical violence. Once society uses these people in this way to help reduce crime, obviously we have some responsibility to look after their interests and that responsibility is generally in the form of giving them a new identity. To do that effectively requires complex changes to both Commonwealth and State law. I hope that we will see the Commonwealth and the States cooperating during the next year or two to ensure that changes are effected that will enable changes of identity to work effectively. Therefore, the whole witness protection scheme throughout Australia might become not only more effective but also a continuing inducement for those who are prepared to come forward and give evidence to do so in order to break up organised crime rings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on witness protection is welcomed in some ways but, in other ways, I think that it has misread some of the report itself. Certainly, the Government accepted our main recommendation, which was the establishment of a witness protection unit under a coordinated method whereby the Australian Federal Police would provide the logistic works-the basic exercises-and State police forces could then avail themselves of the facilities offered by the Australian Federal Police. To enable all that to occur, the Committee recommended that a liaison committee be established. The Government did not accept that proposal for a liaison committee. However, the more I read of the Government's response the more I thought that what it was recommending was very similar to a liaison committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned that the Government did not seem to address itself to what is, in fact, a prime legislative problem for the Commonwealth and the States. Talking within this parliamentary context, Federal Police officers, who are doing the bulk of this work-they have to do the bulk of the work with regard to the National Crime Authority-are operating under a great deal of difficulty in the witness protection area, mainly because the legislation with which they are concerned is legislation not governing the Federal Police but governing matters such as taxation and social security. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say that Australian Federal Police officers are operating illegally, but certainly the Committee found, in terms of the evidence given to it, that those police are operating under a great deal of strain and stress in getting their work coordinated with the requirements of social security and taxation legislation. I believe that it is not good enough to wait until the States get their acts in order on this. Indeed, some of the States that gave evidence to the Committee did not seem to have a great deal of interest in this area. In fact, at least one State said that it did not have any concern because it never had any witnesses to protect. That particular State probably rued the day that it put in that submission because it has a number of people to protect now. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has serious people to protect, not only in terms of the witnesses who came before the Committee but also in terms of subsequent successful operations by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> If police forces under Commonwealth executive government control are to go about their business in a proper and regulated fashion, I believe that, as a matter of urgency, we must bring the laws into line with the activities those police have to carry out. If people want to know what the details of those are they are canvassed extensively in the Committee's report. They go to the heart of the operations of the Federal Police force so that our people can carry on the work which I think every member of the Committee found very impressive. We were impressed by all the Australian Federal Police personnel whom we met and by their dedication to this particularly difficult task. I do not believe that this Parliament should simply sit on its hands and allow that task to remain as difficult as it is when, in fact, it is within our legislative purview to lighten their load and enable them to engage in activities which would make the knowledge of those witnesses to the general public a lot less easy to get hold of. The two major areas which were brought to our attention time and time again were taxation and social security law. I hope that the Commonwealth will take this on as a matter of urgency and that an amending Bill will see the light of day very rapidly. I am sure that, if it does, this Parliament will want to give it a swift passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which I have just tabled relates to the approval by the Public Works Committee of the expansion of the international terminal complex at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport at an estimated cost of $214m at April 1988 prices. The Committee considers the need for these works to be urgent. When the inadequacies of the existing international terminal complex are combined with the projected growth in international passenger numbers of at least 7 per cent per annum into the medium term future, it is clear that the Government must act now to expand existing international terminal facilities. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is a critical facility for international tourism, business activity and cargo for Sydney, New South Wales and the Australian economy. Any inadequacies at the airport will have significant economic ramifications for Australia's economic prosperity. The Committee supports the Federal Airports Corporation's decision to fast-track the development. As a further means of ensuring the project is completed on time, on cost and with the objective of eliminating industrial disputation, the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation encourage the development of an industrial agreement between the successful construction contractor and the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Due to the complexity of the proposed international terminal development, a significant component of the facilities and related infrastructure will be contributed by other organisations, namely, the airlines, Commonwealth government departments that deal with issues such as customs, health, immigration and police, oil companies and the New South Wales Government. The Committee noted the project is supported strongly by all of those groups, each of which has agreed to provide its respective facilities or infrastructures. In considering the proposal the Committee also gave careful consideration to the concerns of the residents and councils that had raised a number of objections to the proposal, particularly in relation to the Federal Airports Corporation's environmental assessment. Whilst not questioning the quality of that assessment, the Committee shares the view of the residents and councils that the Federal Airports Corporation would have been better advised to have secured the services of an independent environmental expert to prepare the assessment of environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Committee has noted the work which the Federal Airports Corporation has commissioned on the development of a master plan for the international sector of the airport. To ensure the overall orderly development and operation of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation prepare a master plan for the whole of the airport as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>

<PARA>Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, for fifty-eight years self-government for the Australian Capital Territory has been an issue which has inspired considerable debate. The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988 now before the House will establish the A.C.T. as a body politic, with the legislative and executive powers and responsibilities of the States and the Northern Territory. This Bill represents the most significant transfer of power, on a population basis, since Papua New Guinea became independent. It will allow 270,000 people the same democratic rights and social responsibilities as their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. and the City of Canberra have well and truly come of age. Canberra is the nation's capital-it is the home of many of the symbols of our nationhood-the National Gallery, the High Court, the National Library and of course this magnificent building-the home of the nation's Parliament. But, and this is often overlooked, it is also home for 270,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> 270,000 people live in the Australian Capital Territory. They go about the day-to-day business of their lives, working at their jobs, paying their taxes, making decisions about which school their children will go to, which doctor or hospital will care for them when they are ill-just like every other Australian. However, unlike every other person in this country-where `a fair go' is the creed by which we live-they cannot elect a member of their own community to their own government. They have no say in the decisions which affect their everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA> What an extraordinary admission in a country so committed to democratic ideals, and why? Are these people somehow different from other Australians? Are they second-class citizens in some way? Do they not understand, or have opinions on, the issues that confront them daily? Can they not be trusted with their own destiny? The answer to all these questions is very simple-the only difference between these people and the rest of Australia is that they live in the Australian Capital Territory!</PARA>
<PARA> Is it not something of an irony, that because this is the `National Capital', the symbol of Australian democracy, it has proven too hard for us to grant its citizens that most fundamental of democratic rights-the right to look after their own affairs?</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra has long been regarded as a company town, with its economy inextricably tied to the public sector. Times have changed and the Territory has grown. It is now a mature City/State which can no longer look to the Commonwealth alone for the economic security of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of Canberra as the national capital is now virtually complete. The development of a diversified economy, incorporating a vibrant private sector is this community's right and need. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis is there. Canberra already has a burgeoning tourism industry with the potential for bigger and better things. There is in place a tertiary education sector ready to make Canberra a centre of intellectual excellence and to support the development of modern, high technology industries. The ideas and the drive for Canberra's future should come from the people of this Territory. They need their own elected government to make the laws, establish the framework and provide the creative spark that will change the focus of Canberra's development to make sure that the future needs of the community are best met. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the logical and inevitable political conclusion to the process of economic and administrative evolution which has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of the Territory has been radically altered since the first serious attempts to achieve self-government a few years ago. There are no longer twelve Commonwealth departments involved in territorial matters. Functions have been consolidated in a single Administration complete with a stand-alone A.C.T. Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes were introduced to ensure the smooth and orderly transition to self-government. The management of the Territory has now been arranged into a system that can and should be handed over to local political representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Territory is unique, virtually all its residents live in the one city-Canberra. It needs a form of government that acknowledges its unique nature and this is what is being proposed-one level of government appropriate to the City/State of the A.C.T. It needs a form of government that also recognises its situation as the nation's capital. This proposal has been designed to ensure that the Commonwealth will look after the national aspects and the A.C.T. the territorial and local aspects-in a manner that protects the interests of both. </PARA>
<PARA> In establishing an A.C.T. government, the Australian Capital Territory will be a body politic under the Crown. It will consist of a legislative arm and an executive arm to exercise powers as set out in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The dual nature of the Territory-home to both its residents and the nation's capital-will be reflected in the financial arrangements put in place by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. will have the same legislative and executive powers and responsibilities over finances as the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. will be treated by the Commonwealth on the same financial basis as the States and the Northern Territory-fairness and equity will be assured. The A.C.T. will be given protections consistent with those given the States and the Northern Territory, whilst the impact of the location of the nation's capital within its boundaries will be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 will be amended to recognise the A.C.T.'s financial autonomy and national capital aspects, as well as to allow for direct access by the A.C.T. to the Grants Commission, at the A.C.T.'s request. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding to the A.C.T. will fully recognise the effects of Canberra's role as the national capital and seat of Commonwealth government on such things as the standards and costs of works and services. This Bill explicitly provides that these special circumstances be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will retain responsibility for financing its functions within the Territory and the Bill provides that the A.C.T. will not be liable for the cost of administering any function retained by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will provide additional assistance to the A.C.T. for any further functions transferred from the Commonwealth in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to see that the transfer of financial power from the Commonwealth to the A.C.T., and the transition to Commonwealth, State and local government financial arrangements, is smooth, non-disruptive and fair. Commonwealth funding to the A.C.T. will be guaranteed in real terms for the first two years of self-government. This guarantee also applied to the 1988-89 A.C.T. Budget to protect the A.C.T. from the funding reductions felt by the States and the Northern Territory and to maintain the base level of funding in the lead up to self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding has also been provided in this year's Budget to cover the additional recurrent costs to run the A.C.T. government, as well as the first Assembly election. As was done in the Northern Territory, the Government will also consider a grant to cover necessary establishment costs-such as those needed for a parliamentary library, a Treasury computer system and a building to house the Assembly and Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> After the guarantee period, funding will be the subject of negotiation with the Executive to smooth the transition to processes consistent with Commonwealth, State and local government financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements will complete the ongoing process of bringing A.C.T. finances into line with the rest of Australia-a process which began in 1985-86. Throughout, the Government has taken into account the reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission into A.C.T. finances. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the financial impact on the Commonwealth, the Bill will not involve additional Commonwealth expenditures other than the one-off establishment assistance. Savings will accrue to the Commonwealth through separation of responsibilities of A.C.T. administration from the Commonwealth system. In the longer term, the arrangements will allow Commonwealth funding to the A.C.T. on a basis more directly comparable to that to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address individual parts of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I provides for the usual preliminary matters of commencement and interpretation. Jervis Bay Territory is a separate Commonwealth Territory and is not affected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II establishes the Legislative Assembly and covers the range of procedural matters necessary for the conduct of the Assembly's business. The Assembly will consist of 17 members elected at large for a fixed term of four years. The number of members may be varied by regulation at the request of the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> At its first meeting, the Assembly will elect a Presiding Officer and a Chief Minister. The Chief Minister will appoint three other Ministers and these four people will form the Australian Capital Territory Executive. The function of the Executive will be to govern the Territory with respect to the matters outlined in Schedule 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 4 gives the Executive power over virtually all matters affecting the Territory. The Commonwealth will, until 1 July 1990, retain within the Attorney-General's portfolio the establishment of courts, the provision of police services and the control of legal practitioners, companies and securities. This arrangement will allow the A.C.T. a settling-in period before assuming responsibilities which are currently outside the province of the A.C.T. Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is disposed to have the Executive enter into an agency arrangement with the Australian Federal Police to provide police services to the Territory. The Government will decide by 1 July 1990 whether courts will transfer to the A.C.T. The national function of classifying materials for censorship purposes will be retained by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before, the Territory is home to the nation's capital-this fact cannot be ignored. The Commonwealth will continue to have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the Territory's good government. Consequently, this Part includes a provision for the Governor-General to dissolve the Assembly and appoint a Commissioner if the Assembly is incapable of performing its functions, or is conducting its affairs in a grossly improper manner. In this eventuality, a general election must be held within 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III details the powers of the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assembly will have the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory. Most Ordinance law in place in the Territory will become Assembly law on commencing day. The Governor-General will, as occurs in the Northern Territory, have the power to disallow any Assembly law within six months of the law being made. Commonwealth law will prevail over Assembly law.</PARA>
<PARA> Protections such as these are essential in the national capital. They are, of course, instruments of last resort and it is the Government's intention to resolve any potential conflict with the A.C.T. by consultation and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the powers and functions I described previously, the Assembly will have the power to entrench the manner and form of making particular laws by submitting an entrenching law to a referendum. Its purpose is to extend to the people of the Territory, who are not party to the Australia Act, the general provisions of that Act, which allow the States to entrench laws relating to the constitution, powers and procedures of their Parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV details the role and functions of the Executive. As I indicated earlier, the Chief Minister will appoint three Ministers. As with the number of members, the number of Ministers may be varied by regulation at the request of the Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV also provides for a general election if a resolution of no confidence in the Chief Minister is passed and a new Chief Minister is not elected within 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V will permit the A.C.T. to implement its own administration, management and staffing arrangements. The Chief Minister will appoint a Head of Administration who will be the principal adviser to the Executive and generally have prime responsibility, under the Chief Minister, for the administrative functions of the body politic. The Chief Minister may also appoint Associate Heads of Administration as necessary to support the other Ministers in the exercise of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assembly will have the power to enact its own staffing laws and the Head of Administration may employ staff in accordance with such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial provisions are covered in Part VI. The A.C.T. will have an autonomous Treasury. As I explained earlier, the A.C.T. will be treated on the same basis as the States and the Northern Territory in terms of its financial relationship with the Commonwealth. However, the special circumstances arising from the existence within the Territory of the national capital and the seat of government of the Commonwealth will be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth may lend money to the A.C.T. or to a Territory authority. The A.C.T. may, with the approval of the Commonwealth Treasurer, borrow money from agencies other than the Commonwealth. Any such borrowings may be guaranteed by the Commonwealth and the A.C.T. may use its assets as security. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VII allows for members of the Assembly to be elected under the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988. Part VII also sets out the necessary qualifications of candidates and the processes for filling casual vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VIII attends to miscellaneous provisions and constitutional guarantees. The A.C.T. will be brought into line with the States and the Northern Territory by applying provisions similar to section 92 of the Constitution, guaranteeing free trade. This will not bind the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional provisions will be included in consequential legislation to ensure the smooth transfer of powers and functions to the incoming government. Until the A.C.T. enacts its own staffing law, the consequential legislation will provide for staff of the A.C.T. Administration to be employed under the Public Service Act 1922 and other relevant Commonwealth legislation and awards. It will also provide for consultation to take place between the Executive, the Commonwealth and Peak Union Councils before the terms and conditions of employment of staff who are to be employed under the A.C.T.'s own staffing law are determined. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the consultative processes to be provided for in the consequential legislation, Part VIII of this, the Self-Government Bill, provides for consultations to occur on an ongoing basis between the Commonwealth and the A.C.T. on public sector industrial and staffing matters. These provisions are designed to protect the rights and entitlements of Administration staff and also to ensure that the A.C.T. will take account of the effect of its decisions on the Commonwealth's interests as the major employer in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VIII also allows for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the salaries and allowances of Assembly members, Ministers, the Presiding Officer, the Head of Administration and any Associate Heads of Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be clear that this legislation is both comprehensive and well-conceived. It provides for fully responsible government for the people of the Territory, in its most democratic, practical and economic form. </PARA>
<PARA> It safeguards the Commonwealth's interests in the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA> It provides for an efficient and effective administration. </PARA>
<PARA> It puts the A.C.T. on a proper financial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> It ensures that the residents of the Territory will be properly and effectively represented in the management of their affairs. It is a milestone in the democratic processes of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for a system to elect the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. This, Mr President, is the Government's third attempt at introducing an electoral system for the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 this Government first moved to introduce self-government for the Territory. The proposal then, as now, allowed for a government comprising a single House of Legislature-a People's House. The electoral system proposed-single member electorates-was the same as that used to elect members to every People's House in all English speaking democracies-including, of course, Australia. To propose that this Territory also elect its representatives from single electorates in the same way as other mainland Australians was therefore not novel or controversial, yet this proposition was not supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, committed then as now to self- government for the Territory, compromised. It proposed an amalgam of Australian electoral systems-around half of the members to be elected from single member electorates using House of Representatives rules, with the balance elected at large using Senate rules. This, of course, represented a significant shift from the principle that the people of the Territory should be treated just like other Australians when it comes to electing their representatives. However, this proposal too was not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988 is already before the Senate. In proposing self-government for the Territory, the Government has once again demonstrated its commitment to democracy for all. </PARA>
<PARA> Facing the rejection of existing Australian electoral systems, the Government has turned to an electoral system used commonly throughout the non-English speaking Western democracies to elect People's Houses. This system, known as the d'Hondt system, provides for direct proportional representation. The hallmark of this system is also a concern for both democracy and stable government. It is once again a compromise, but it is a compromise we are prepared to make in an effort to give the people of the Territory the same democratic rights as their fellow Australians. It will be unique to Australia, but this Territory-a City/State-is also unique in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of any electoral system for a People's House is twofold-to accurately reflect the electoral wishes of the people in the composition of their government and, of great importance, to provide for stable government. </PARA>
<PARA> Some with vested interests have advocated that the Hare Clark system of proportional representation be used to elect the Assembly. This Government makes no apology for rejecting a system that is specifically designed for a House of Review. Under its rules, seats may be literally decided by chance on the preferences of voters who may well have had no idea-or wish-that their vote would elect particular candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, to decide some seats in the last A.C.T. House of Assembly elections using these rules, votes had to be distributed more than 20 times. In the last Senate elections, a candidate with less than 1.5 per cent of the primary vote was elected. Yet others with more than double this primary vote were not. </PARA>
<PARA> This may be acceptable in a House of Review, but it could create instability in a People's House where such members may hold the balance of power. </PARA>
<PARA> The d'Hondt system, is a People's House system. It is very familiar to and respected by the democracies of Europe. It has been used for many years in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Finland, West Germany and the Netherlands, all of which enjoy the reputation of being democratic, stable and prosperous states. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this system, all contestants are elected as accurately as possible in accordance with the proportion of votes received. The system is completely neutral between contestants and satisfies the stability side of the equation by ensuring that the party or parties with a majority of votes will command a majority of the seats. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing mystical or complex about this system. A very simple mathematical calculation ensures the direct and accurate reflection of the voters' intention in the composition of the House. It does no more or less than make sure that, as closely as mathematically possible, each and every member in the House is supported by the same number of voters. It is immune from gerrymander. Every vote has equal value and in fact it is the most direct system of proportional representation that one can get. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the financial impact on the Commonwealth, the Bill will not involve additional Commonwealth expenditure other than that already provided for the first Assembly election, the estimated cost of which is $620,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn my attention to a brief description of the main features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The cornerstone of the Bill is the application of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, suitably modified, to Assembly elections. The Bill divides the Commonwealth Electoral Act into three categories:</PARA>
<PARA>the first category consists of those provisions which are modified by Schedule 1 to the Bill and provide the detailed nuts and bolts for the conduct of Assembly elections;</PARA>
<PARA>the second category consists of those provisions which provide the overall framework for Assembly elections and are applied generally; and</PARA>
<PARA>the third category consists of disapplied provisions which have no relevance to Assembly elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the modifications to the Commonwealth Electoral Act arise because of the introduction of the d'Hondt electoral system. The d'Hondt system enables electors to vote for an independent candidate, a pre-determined list of party candidates or indicate the order in which they wish candidates of the party of their choice to be elected. Once seats have been distributed among parties and independents using the d'Hondt mathematical calculation, seats won by a party are allocated to its candidates by distributing votes in the same way as in Senate elections. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate a table which illustrates how the d'Hondt distribution works. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>the election of the Assembly for a 4 year fixed term; and</PARA>
<PARA>the conduct of elections for the Assembly without election writs. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Government committed to the principle of fair and democratic elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this Parliament has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the good and stable government of this, the nation's capital. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill achieves this. It will extend to the people of the Territory the same rights as their fellow Australians to look after their own affairs in an orderly, democratic way. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Bill 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Management Bill 1988 heralds a new era in the planning and development of the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reflects the findings of Mr Block's report on the ongoing role of the NCDC in the context of moves to self-government. It, together with the A.C.T. (Self-Government) Bill 1988, establishes a framework for funding and administering national capital concerns separately from municipal and territorial concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra is a magnificent place. We all acknowledge the expertise and creativity that has gone into making Canberra what it is today-a national capital unequalled in the world for its natural and man-made beauty. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1957, the architect of this city has been the National Capital Development Commission. The Commission was created at a time when it appeared that Walter Burley Griffin's vision for Canberra may not be fulfilled. The Commission took up the challenge and today Canberra is a vibrant reflection of our nation-a City/State in which the whole nation can take pride. The Commission can be proud of the fact that it has taken Canberra from the `bush capital' of the 1950's to the national capital of the 1980's. Its efforts mean that the development of Canberra as the nation's capital is virtually complete. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few national projects yet to be built, such as the National Museum. However, the important and exciting task ahead is for Canberra to develop and grow as a community. The task is to see that it provides in a balanced way for all the diversified economic and social needs of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> With maturity comes responsibility. Under new financial arrangements that are already in place, A.C.T. citizens will pay for territorial planning and development activities like the rest of us. Fairness and equity requires that there now be an accompanying and unambiguous division between national and local responsibilities. This Bill achieves this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will accept administrative and financial responsibility to maintain and enhance the character of the Territory as the national capital. The A.C.T. will accept the normal State-type administrative and financial responsibility to plan and develop the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will abolish the NCDC and set up a new national planning body, the National Capital Planning Authority, directly responsible to the Commonwealth Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This new Authority will prepare a National Capital Plan which will define the policies, aesthetic principles and any development requirements required to maintain and enhance the character of the National Capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. will be responsible for the normal range of State-type planning and development matters. A Territorial planning authority will be set up. It will be responsible for developing and managing a Territory Plan not inconsistent with the National Capital Plan. It will also be able to set out the detailed planning, design and development conditions for all land in the Territory except designated national capital areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires of both governments parliamentary scrutiny, public consultation and review processes to ensure openness. There will be no scope for corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> Ownership of the land will remain with the Commonwealth. The A.C.T. will be responsible for the orderly development of land to meet the needs of the community. Therefore, land other than that reserved by the Commonwealth for its purposes will be managed by the A.C.T. on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements will take time to put in place. Any hiatus in A.C.T. planning and development must be avoided. This Bill therefore introduces appropriate interim measures to allow for the smooth and orderly introduction of the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact of these changes on the Commonwealth will be positive. The integration of NCDC functions into the A.C.T. Administration and the Department of Administrative Services, together with the creation of the National Capital Planning Authority, will result in savings. These savings are estimated at some 120 staff yielding $6.6m per year. Initial integration of NCDC functions has provided a saving of about 80 positions this year. A further saving of about 40 positions is expected to be brought to account in 1989. In undertaking these changes, the Government has been and will continue to be concerned to fully protect the interests of NCDC staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the various Parts of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I provides for the usual preliminary matters of commencement and interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II establishes the National Capital Planning Authority, prescribes its powers and functions and makes it subject to general ministerial direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III prescribes the object of the National Capital Plan and outlines what matters the Authority may include when preparing a draft Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Plan is to ensure that the Commonwealth's national capital interests in the Territory are fully protected, without otherwise involving the Commonwealth in matters that should be the prerogative of the Canberra community. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation requires public notification, consideration of representations, and consultations between the Commonwealth and A.C.T. governments before the Plan is brought into effect. The Minister's approval to the Plan is subject to parliamentary disallowance provisions. A process of ministerial certification will be used to protect the draft plan where this is required before normal approval processes have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV requires the Assembly to establish a Territory planning authority to prepare and administer a Territory Plan. This Plan will provide the people of the Territory with an attractive, safe and efficient environment in which to live, work and have their recreation. The Bill outlines the parameters of the Plan and ensures that it cannot operate inconsistently with the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, this Part requires the Assembly to make laws for the procedure to make the Plan, as well as requirements for public notification, consideration of representations, and consultations between the Commonwealth and ACT governments before the Plan is brought into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Assembly is also required to ensure by law that there are just and timely processes in place to review appropriate planning, design and development decisions. These reviews will be conducted without unnecessary formality. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V provides for the management of land in the A.C.T. It confers on the Commonwealth the right to specify at any time which areas of land it requires for its use or intended use. This land will be called National Land. </PARA>
<PARA> All other land will be called Territory Land and will be managed by the A.C.T. Executive on the Commonwealth's behalf. The existing leasehold system will be retained and only the Commonwealth will be able to vary it. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.C.T. will be liable for any acts or omissions in its management of Territory Land, as will the Commonwealth in respect of National Land. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions are included to define the relationship which will exist between the two governments in respect of financial aspects of land management. These are required to allow Commonwealth/State financial arrangements to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI sets out the constitution of the National Planning Authority. It confers the responsibility to determine remuneration for Authority members on the Remuneration Tribunal and covers appointments to the Authority, obligations imposed on Authority members. It also sets out requirements for meetings of the Authority and permits the appointment of advisory committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VII sets out that a Chief Executive will manage the affairs of the Authority under its general directions and that its staff will be employed under the Public Service Act. The Authority may engage consultants and is required to present to the Minister a report annually on its operations, which will be tabled in both Houses of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VIII provides that the A.C.T. will be indemnified by the Commonwealth for any claims made against it in respect of any matter arising from the Commonwealth's management, actions or inactions before self-government or concerning National Land. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IX repeals existing National Capital Development Commission legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Part X sets out transitional provisions that are necessary for the first 12 months after self-government. They will cover the period before the A.C.T. Executive and the A.C.T. planning authority have been established, as well as allow the first National Capital Plan to be brought into effect. During this period, relevant National Capital Development Commission policies will continue in effect. The provisions of this Act regarding the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the A.C.T. to manage and vary planning policies will generally apply. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is further evidence of the Government's commitment to giving the people of the Territory the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements will create an unambiguous separation of responsibility for National Capital planning from Territory planning and development. </PARA>
<PARA> They ensure that the interests of the Commonwealth in, and the character of, the Territory as the nation's capital are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> They guarantee that the Commonwealth will not be required to take financial responsibility for other than its national capital interests. </PARA>
<PARA> They allow the people of the Territory to control the day-to-day planning and development of their home. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill represents the final part of the package of legislation introduced by the Government to establish self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes provision for necessary transitional and consequential matters arising from the establishment of the ACT as a body politic by the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Its object is to ensure that the normal business of government and existing rights enjoyed by residents and transferred staff continue during the transfer of functions from the Commonwealth to the ACT. The Government will ensure that the transfer of power to ACT residents and its elected government is smooth and with as little disruption as possible to their everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is particularly concerned to look after the interests of staff who are to be transferred to the employment of the ACT. Provisions in this Bill ensure the preservation of existing conditions of service under various Commonwealth legislation including conditions relating to workers' compensation, long service leave, maternity leave, superannuation and grievance appeals. The ACT will be free, of course, to make its own provisions for its employees but before it may do so, consultations must take place with the Commonwealth and relevant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of interim arrangements relating to administrative law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the transfer to the ACT of rights, assets and contracts of the Commonwealth which relate to transferred functions. Specific provision is made to transfer to the ACT Commonwealth moneys applied in the Territory for territorial purposes and to protect appropriately the financial interests of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill will, in themselves, have no financial impact on the Commonwealth other than in the context of proposed financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the various parts of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part I deals with commencement and interpretative matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II details the various transitional matters I have mentioned before and allows any further necessary consequential and transitional matters to be dealt with by the regulations or ACT Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III contains a number of Schedules which effect modifications and amendments to various Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedules 1 to 4 contain modifications to Commonwealth employment legislation in its application to staff transferred to the employment of the Territory. The modifications recognise that such staff will be answerable to Territory Ministers and the ACT Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large, amendments detailed in Schedule 5 ensure that, for the purposes of the application of various Commonwealth Acts, the ACT is treated in the same manner as are the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 5 also contains amendments to place the government of Jervis Bay on the same footing as other Commonwealth Territories which do not have self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as I have said in relation to the introduction of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill, the transfer of functions from the Commonwealth to the ACT represents a challenge for the people of the ACT. For the first time, they will have a real say in how they are governed. I am confident they will exercise the rights and accept the obligations which other Australians who live outside the ACT take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday, when we commenced debating these four Bills, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Bill and cognate Bills in the Senate, I had, by one of those fortunes which occur to all honourable senators from time to time, commenced my remarks I think approximately seven minutes before the adjournment of that particular segment of our business was called, in order to move to Question Time at 11.55 a.m., and I was forced at that time to interrupt my remarks, which I now wish to resume. I was in the course of making some general remarks about the Government's taxation policies and, in particular, the capacity of the Government to give real tax cuts, as it has promised it will, as from 1 July next year, real tax cuts moreover of a significant magnitude, and given on a basis which could be called responsible in terms of their impact upon the economy as it may be seen to be at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had noted in my remarks last Friday that any tax cuts in 1989-90 of less than about $2 billion in magnitude could not be described as real tax cuts because that will be about the magnitude of the degree of bracket creep which the so-called progressive personal income tax system will deliver to the Government's revenues in the course of the financial year 1989-90. It follows from that that any tax cut of less than that magnitude, or about that magnitude, will result in an increase in the real burden of taxes in our next financial year. I think it is important to get that benchmark established before we start talking about tax cuts, so that we all know what we are actually talking about when we talk about real tax cuts. Anything less than about about $2 billion will not, in that sense, be a real tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know, over and above that datum point, what the Government would regard as a significant tax cut. What would it be in 1989-90? Would a figure-I use it here purely for illustrative purposes-of, say, $3 billion in 1989-90 be regarded as a significant tax cut? In other words, to achieve a significant real tax cut, would the Government have to cut taxes next financial year by about $5 billion in nominal terms? I make it clear that there is every indication on present budgetary prospects that the size of the Budget surplus will not, unless something very unexpected happens between now and the delivery of the Budget, of itself prevent a tax cut of that magnitude. But that, of course, is not the point. Government's do not look, and have not looked for many years at their Budgets in that purely accounting sense, important though it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point that the Government will have to ask itself as it comes to make these decisions, as it approaches 1 July next near, is: Will we be able to give a tax cut of that magnitude, say-to use my illustrative figure-of $5 billion, or a real cut of $3 billion, responsibly? That question then raises the test of what is meant by that word `responsibly' in economic terms. Of course, one answer is that the Government will need to be able to give any tax cut that it finds it is able in the end to give in a manner or on a basis which will not cause our balance of payments deficit to blow out even faster than it is already blowing out, thus causing our foreign debt to mount even faster than it is already mounting and/or causing us to sell off various assets to foreigners even faster than we are now selling them. Apropos that aspect of the matter, I think we shall next week receive another instalment of the balance of payments deficit saga when we receive the monthly balance of payments current account figures for October. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that already in the first three months of this financial year we have recorded a balance of payments deficit of $3,844m, which compares with the forecast deficit for the year as a whole as laid down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at the time of the Budget of $9,500m. It is clear, at least to anyone who is prepared to see, that unless a miracle should occur, there is now no longer any chance of the Budget-time forecast for balance of payments being achieved. What we do not know, and I certainly do not pretend to forecast, is what the balance of payments deficit for 1988-89 will be. We can be virtually certain that it will be more than the Treasurer's forecast of $9.5 billion, but as yet we cannot be sure how much greater it will be than that figure. But even, I note in passing, the Treasurer's own forecast of a $9.5 billion annual deficit would be tantamount to roughly equivalent of 3 per cent of our national product. That is a high figure even by so-called traditional standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we must acknowledge at this stage of our country's fortunes that so-called traditional standards are no longer relevant. When those so-called traditional standards were being formed or experienced, our net foreign debt amounted to between 5 to 10 per cent of national product. As at the last count, at 30 June last, our net debt amounted to 30 per cent of our national product. It is quite clear that a deficit one may think one can sustain when debts amount to 5 per cent or even 10 per cent of annual national product is quite inappropriate once the debts have become three or six times that level in proportionate terms. I note that even the Treasurer's original forecast of a balance of payments deficit of $9.5 billion was simply not acceptable as a basis for the operation of policy. We simply cannot afford that kind of smug acceptance of even a $9.5 billion balance of payments deficit. And we certainly cannot afford and will not be able to afford what no doubt will be the equally smug acceptance of whatever the even greater deficit will be by the time we come to know what it is at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to talk about a responsible and real tax cut, it is clear that the Government cannot give one on 1 July next year as things stand. The Government cannot give a responsible real tax cut, although of course it may be prepared to give an irresponsible one-and only time will tell. Why cannot the Government in those circumstances give a responsible real tax cut? Because to do so will be to place a significant additional amount of real purchasing power in the hands of consumers. Consumers naturally, and I am in no way criticising them for this, will go out and spend a high proportion of it-let us say, 90 per cent of it, for the sake of argument. A proportion of that in turn, of the total addition to their demand on the economy, will then find its way into demand at the margin for additional imports, thereby making our balance of payments position even worse than it already appears likely to be. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the nub of the Government's prospective problem in this area-a problem of which, until very recently, it did not appear to be keenly aware. It is fair to add that since the Budget was brought down, and particularly while the Treasurer, Mr Keating, was overseas, one or two senior Ministers-I have in mind the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh-began to express some responsible reservations about certain aspects of the game plan to which the Treasurer had, so to speak, committed the Government in the Budget Speech. It is rather unfortunate, as I have observed elsewhere, that those senior Ministers are reported to have been gagged from speaking about these matters, which are now to be the sole preserve of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer, because to date at least we have not had a great deal of sense from either of those gentlemen. We must hope for an improvement in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add, again without dwelling on the point, that the problem to which I point would be made even more acute for the Government-and hence for all of us, because we are all sufferers when the Government gets things wrong-if, in the distribution of any tax cuts the Government should finally give, it directs those tax cuts principally towards lower and middle income earners, as several Ministers in the Government, including the Minister for Finance, have indicated should be done. Whatever might be thought about the so-called equity, or some other word of that kind, of such a policy angle to the tax cuts, the fact is that the more such tax cuts are skewed towards lower income earners and even middle income earners, the greater proportion of them will be spent and the smaller proportion of them will be saved. Hence, the greater the impact will be on total demand for goods and services and hence, in turn, on demand for imports of goods and services. In the end, that is the bottom line to all these matters to which we keep on having to return. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is on the assumption that the world outside our borders in the overseas economies holds together-not merely during the remainder of the current financial year 1988-89, but also into the 1989-90 financial year. The economic effects of these proposed tax cuts will begin to be felt in 1989-90 and will begin to impact on the balance of payments. That is therefore the year in which the economic background will be of particular significance for these proposed tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves, without at the moment being able to answer the question, but looking ahead so far as we can, the question, as we approach 1989-90-which is only eight months away, let us say in May next year or thereabouts, which I presume would be the latest date by which the Treasurer would be able to announce the actual tax schedule, if he is to make tax cuts-`What will be the situation of the world in prospect by that time?' Will we find ourselves by May next beginning to look down the barrel of an economic gun in terms of the international economy-an economic gun in the form of an approaching, or even by then an actual, deterioration in our international terms of trade as world economic growth perhaps begins to slow down? I cannot and do not pretend to predict what will be the conditions in the world economy at that time. But anyone who has paid any attention at all to world economic developments in the past year or so must continue to have in mind a large question mark, particularly after the American presidential elections are out of the way, as to where the world economy will then proceed to go during the next year or so. I simply ask: How will the Government in those circumstances, should they come to prevail, be able responsibly-again, I emphasise that word-to give tax cuts, even insignificant ones, let alone significant and real ones?</PARA>
<PARA> My only point in concluding this element of my remarks is that I believe that the Government is being less than responsible in its discussion of these matters with the electorate in not drawing problems or possible problems of this kind to the attention of the public so that if we should come to such a pass in six months time or so we will not have a vastly disappointed public on our hands, and one which will therefore perhaps be less responsible itself in its reactions to such an outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I had hoped to say something about two particular aspects of these Bills, but my time is drawing to a close and I may reserve those remarks for the committee stage. I will simply state the elements in question. I wish in the committee stage to refer first to the extraordinary retrospectivity of certain aspects of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988, in particular clauses 38 and 43. Those two clauses in particular have been the subject of what I think it is fair to described as severely adverse comment by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its twelfth report. There will be more to be said on that aspect in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I want to contrast the retrospectivity in those clauses of the Bill with the non-retrospectivity of clause 46, which addresses a problem that has arisen in the treatment for capital gains tax purposes of certain forms of assets transferred from one spouse to another as a result, for example, of an order by the Family Court of Australia following the break-up of a marriage. Unlike clauses 38 and 43, clause 46 does not have a retrospective effect, so such transfers made between the time when the capital gains tax became law and the effective date of this Bill, will be caught for capital gains tax. There is no intention, it seems, on the Government's part to amend what seems to be a glaring injustice as a result. While the Opposition does not normally favour retrospectivity, where, as in this case, the retrospectivity would confer benefits on our citizens and correct an injustice in the process we are certainly in favour of that kind of retrospectivity. There will certainly be discussion of this clause in the committee stage, and I shall reserve any further remarks on the matter for that time. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="2134" SPEAKER="Knowles Sen S.C." NAMEID="TH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.05)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). I wish to comment on two areas in particular. Both these Bills incorporate a whole list of changes, many of which are minor. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), in making amendments to the capital gains and fringe benefits taxes, reminds us of two notable firsts from the supposed world's greatest Treasurer. One is a tax on enterprise and capital accumulation; the other remains a tax not simply on benefits but on necessary work expenses. I draw that distinction quite clearly in relation to the fringe benefits tax because most aspects of this tax are very much work related.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provision of roll-over relief from capital gains tax does not alter the essential fact that this Labor Government levies capital gains tax at 49 per cent, which is, I might add, one of the highest rates in the world. An underlying hostility to the concept of a capital profit has blinded this Government to the overseas experience that greater returns to revenue are achieved by levying tax at a far lower rate, but the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is very much a tax junkie and will find any excuse to levy new and additional taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The fringe benefits tax, which is fundamentally flawed by the cynically expedient method of billing the employer rather than the beneficiary, continues to cost the mining industry in Western Australia $20m annually. Unfortunately, the effects of this are still being felt dramatically in the mining towns, particularly in the Pilbara and the goldfields. Further concessions to extend the 50 per cent discount of the tax on remote area holiday travel and to exempt free travel granted to employees on compassionate grounds only highlight the fact that this Labor Government has never grasped the realities of employment in mining and related industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Treasurer needs to come to Western Australia and particularly the Pilbara, as it is so far away and is such an isolated community, before he starts looking at the imposition and extension of taxes such as this. It is simply not reasonable for employees to meet their own travel and housing expenses when they work in such an inhospitable area as the Pilbara. When I say `inhospitable' I do not mean the people; the area is a very difficult one in which to work. The people, fortunately, are among the most delightful people that one could wish to meet, because they have a great sense of community spirit. But this tax has positively discouraged the growth and survival of towns in remote regions of Western Australia. The Opposition continues to deplore the fact that the fringe benefits tax applies to non-profit organisations, such as independent schools that require staff to reside on the premises for essential supervisory duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that I want to touch on concerns the National Trust of Australia. The National Trust still does not know whether it is to be billed as much as $150,000 for fringe benefits tax. We would have the absurd situation in Western Australia of the Federal Government giving the Trust $50,000 in direct grants and then claiming back $20,000 in fringe benefits tax. On the one hand the Treasurer stated in his press release No. 115 that `unfavourable circumstances' affecting the rental value of a Trust curator's accommodation would result in `extremely moderate' tax liability. On the other hand, however, the Australian Taxation Office in its ruling MT2025 of 21 October 1986 stated that the National Trust was liable for FBT with a maximum discount of 10 to 20 per cent. Last year the Trust, when attempting to clarify its position, was told that ruling MT2025 stood, in contradiction of the Treasurer's very own press release. </PARA>
<PARA> In September last year, the Commissioner of Taxation finally responded to a letter of August 1986-it took him some 13 months to respond-indicating that the Trust might be released from its liability for FBT on the grounds of hardship. I need hardly remind the Senate, however, that indications and assurances can be very different matters. It is a matter of great regret that this Labor Government has not taken the opportunity to give positive effect to the Treasurer's press release, which originally promised the National Trust a measure of elementary justice. The Trust is still waiting for a real answer and has even been advised that the supposed fringe benefit be cashed out in the hands of the Trust's caretakers, who are pensioners and who would lose vital income if this occurred. All this seems absolutely and utterly insane because all the toing-and-froing that is going on is creating such an environment of uncertainty. Unless the Treasurer bestirs himself and keeps his word to the National Trust, the substantial fringe benefits tax liability will result in the closure of at least four Trust properties, two of them in Western Australia. How absurd it is to have a Federal Labor Government that postures as being the saviour of the environment and legislating for sweeping control of land use while still threatening to levy an unjust and crippling tax on Australia's most effective conservation body. It is interesting that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is the Minister responsible for this area, is in the chamber at the moment. I appeal to him to look very seriously at this problem of the National Trust. It is experiencing a grave problem not just in Western Australia but in various areas throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition, for the most part, does not oppose the measures in these two taxation laws amendment Bills, it is greatly concerned about the blatant retrospective liability imposed in clauses 13 and 24 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988 dealing with the taxation of non-cash business benefits. It is outrageous-to put it mildly-that this liability is being imposed 3 1/2 years after the issue of a short press release by the Treasurer. Moreover, it is not a liability that affects only the corporate sector, which has a greater awareness of taxation changes. What is being created in this Bill is a tax liability applying to thousands of ordinary Australians who have been in the business of sales after February 1985 and who, in that time, may have received holidays, cars, electrical appliances, or whatever, as non-cash rewards. </PARA>
<PARA> These are people who were mentioned regularly in debates in the other chamber, such as Avon ladies. I also know of a number of other people in sales fields who over a period have received many benefits as a reward for hard work. But, as we all know, this Government is hell-bent on ensuring that hard work is not rewarded in any way, shape or form; so those people will be presented with both an administrative nightmare and a major financial liability that they may well lack the resources to meet. I am told by the Government that they are supposed to be grateful that they do not face an additional tax penalty for late payment. The whole concept is just so unfair. For it to be 3 1/2 years retrospective is unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA> On several occasions I have drawn attention to the slackness and inherent undesirability of having legislation give effect to the Treasurer's press releases months, and on many occasions, years after they were issued. We have proceeded from the use of announcements to strike down tax avoidance to a general system of government by press release. Mr Eric Risstrom struck a responsive chord when he suggested that these press releases should become inoperative if no legislation is presented within nine months of issue. I am sure that there are many sales people in Australia today who would be very much in agreement with what Mr Risstrom has said on this issue. If they are going to be hit with tax Bills going back 3 1/2 years, I do not think that is particularly desirable for them. The imposition of a retrospective tax liability on ordinary workers 3 1/2 years after a press release is, to my mind, a massive injustice. The liability should apply only from the introduction of this Bill on 31 August. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that I want to canvass relates to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1988. This mechanical Bill that raises exemption thresholds for the Medicare levy in line with the realities of inflation provides us with the opportunity to discuss many aspects of what could only be described as a very much failed Medicare system that is progressively delivering a lower standard of health service for the Australian people. Unfortunately, I suppose that only those who have relatives, family or friends anywhere along the line who have had illnesses for quite some time or who themselves have had the misfortune to be ill really understand the pitfalls of Medicare. The Government is delivering a system that is progressively lowering the standard of health services to all Australian people. It was to avoid future debates of this kind that this Government last year unsuccessfully sought to legislate for all future years so that the actual Bills would become necessary only for changes in the rate of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose these rises in the thresholds. However, I note that, while the Government has not yet chosen to break its last promise to retain the Medicare levy at 1 1/4 per cent of income, it has, in a small way, widened the scope of the levy. This has come about as a consequence of dividend imputation. The imputed tax credits over the 1987-88 year are grossed as taxpayer income and the Medicare levy is applied to an artificially higher total income. Compared with so many other actions of this big taxing government, this extra bite of Medicare applying to people who generally, of course, do not vote for the Government is a fairly minor irritation. It is, however, symptomatic of a government that is desperate to grab every last dollar to fund the Medicare monster which is growing arms and legs all over the place day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> Once more, it has to be stated that the Medicare levy-estimated to raise $2.3 billion this financial year, which, I might add, is in the vicinity of an 11 per cent rise-does not go anywhere near covering the cost of Medicare. It does not remotely cover the total health expenditure budget of $10.8 billion. More pertinently, it falls well short of the $3.7 billion projected spending on medical benefits. The levy is raising only $2.3 billion and the expenditure is five or six times more than that. To meet this cost the levy would need to be in the vicinity of 2.1 per cent of income. For the Australian taxpayer the distinction is academic, as the cost ultimately falls on our own pockets through general revenue. Whilst supposedly we have only a 1 1/4 per cent levy, we are all still paying more and more for this Medicare monster that is just running out of control. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past year it has been made very clear that the Government strategy to restrain the inevitable open-ended costs of this particular socialised health scheme has been to ration services. In other words, artificial barriers have been created so that patients get inferior and less expensive treatment. We all know that that is very much against the wish of medical practitioners and pharmacists, and certainly of members of Parliament on the Opposition benches. Rationing services in the way in which the Government is doing is certainly doing nothing but ensuring that people's lives are being put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The classic example of this rationing was the recent example of the maintaining of drugs on the special authority list, not because they were possibly dangerous but because they were expensive. In its own words, the Government was trying to encourage doctors to think twice before they prescribed the more expensive drugs. It is all very well to say, `Think twice and prescribe cheaper drugs'; but, if they do not do the job in the way in which the more expensive drugs do, what is the net benefit of that? We are just going to have more and more people who are less and less well. Sufferers from high cholesterol and high blood pressure are being pressured through their medical advisers to accept drugs that are cheap but less effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Without retreading the ground of a previous debate that my colleague Senator Puplick led, I reiterate that it is disgraceful that access to drugs controlling life threatening conditions that may cause heart attacks and strokes is discouraged when cheaper drugs are simply not as effective. That is a very worrying concern for so many people who desperately need these drugs and are now fearful that because of this further cost cutting exercise they are going to be prescribed drugs that are cheaper but less effective. No less an authority than Professor John Shaw, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at Sydney University, stated in August that the restriction on the ACE-inhibitors controlling high blood pressure would place some patients at the unnecessary risk of death. The National Heart Foundation's surveys have found that 30 per cent of women and 50 per cent of men with high blood pressure were receiving no treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Dietary change alone cannot always solve the problem. It is quite ridiculous to expect that people would take cheap drugs with unpleasant side effects when they are discouraged from using drugs of proven effectiveness purely and simply on a cost basis. Indeed, one readily available cheaper drug, clofibrate, is associated with a 10 per cent increase in the death rate. I think that indicates what a great tragedy this whole thing is. These cheaper drugs will increase the death rate. It is one thing perhaps to remove Medicare cover from foreign students and Australians travelling abroad, but another to ration services in a manner that threatens the health of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The point was well made in an editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 11 July that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the Australian Labor Party were `slowly but surely destroying' socialised medicine in the sense that it is, of course, the poorer members of our community who suffer in the cost squeeze. Many other members of the community will be able to afford to go out and buy more expensive drugs while waiting for the bureaucratic system to mince its way through the mountain of paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government ignores the lessons that Britain provides where a national health service maintained with little change by successive governments fails to meet demand while costing more and more. The present Conservative Government, accused of neglecting the system, has in fact increased real health funding by 31 per cent in its term of office. Yet, the number of beds in 1974 to 1984 has decreased annually by 6,100 while employee numbers have risen by 14,300 in proportion. While it grieves me to say it, I suppose this is one area where Thatcherism has not worked, basically because it has not been applied. But it is a salutary example of the morass into which Australia is plunging because of the deliberate policy of this Hawke Labor Government. The upside of that aspect is, of course, that the British Prime Minister is very much aware of this problem and in fact is doing something about it even now. The central fallacy of Medicare is as clear today as it ever was. If one fosters the belief that hospital treatment is there at public expense, more Australians will rely exclusively on public hospitals and the waiting lists will be lengthened, so often to the detriment of those who have no alternative but to rely on the public system. So once again, we come back to the point that it is those who can least afford it who are in fact being hit the hardest. </PARA>
<PARA> While there were initial post-Budget press reports of an extra $3 billion for hospitals, the reality is that $1.9 billion has been transferred from the area of States Grants. So it is just a classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Hospital services and benefits amount to $3,625m in 1988-89 compared with $3,468m last year, an absolute minuscule rise of 4.5 per cent-a rise, I might add, that does not even keep pace with the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no mistake that the public hospital waiting lists are a constant Medicare problem. There are 20,000 people on the Victorian waiting lists and the number of those waiting elective surgery has doubled in the last five years. In September it was estimated that 8,000 Western Australians were waiting for elective surgery with 6,455 of them on the formal waiting lists of the three major hospitals-Royal Perth Hospital; the Gairdner or Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, whichever people wish to know it as; and the Fremantle Hospital. Of those, 1,000 await general surgery, 1,500 are orthopaedic patients, 1,200 are ear, nose and throat patients and 900 require ophthalmology. None of these requirements is cosmetic or anything but essential to the patient involved. People are being put through an enormous amount of stress and distress as their conditions worsen. In fact, the taxpayer is being asked to fork out more money to care for many of these patients as their conditions worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact there have been some disturbing reports of pensioners awaiting cataract surgery for as long as three years. Last year the case was reported of a 79-year-old pensioner in Western Australia paying $440 in private hospital bills for a cataract operation. This patient had been assessed for public treatment two years before but was unable to wait longer because of a need to care for a disabled wife. This is yet another example of where those who can least afford to pay are being asked to do so. In July it was reported that the New South Wales State Government was tackling this problem by encouraging the greater use of private hospitals and restoring the situation so that at least two-thirds of privately insured patients are treated in public hospitals. This really emphasises the point that the consequence of the continuing use of Medicare has been the underuse of private hospitals because private insurance is priced out of the reach of more and more Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases public hospitals encourage private patients. There have been examples of Victorian public hospital administrators actively seeking to increase the number of private patients because of the greater remuneration received. That is indicative of the whole system. The public hospitals simply are not getting enough funding and therefore they have to go out and pinch the private patients to ensure that they get that funding. Between January 1986 and December 1987 the proportion of privately insured patients in public hospitals rose from 19 per cent to an unofficial figure of 28 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What in the meantime is happening to all those public patients who are on the waiting list? We all know that they are either dying or their conditions are becoming further exacerbated by the wait. It hardly needs to be said that this extra pressure on the public hospital system is detrimental to those who cannot afford private insurance but who, as Senator Peter Baume pointed out at the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science Conference in July, are more likely to suffer serious illness. </PARA>
<PARA> We should all be concerned at the fact that the pressure on Australian public hospitals, with the lack of elective surgery that this has created, is having a serious effect on the capacity of teaching hospitals to fulfil this part of their function. Trainee surgeons may see plenty of road accident victims, but what else are they seeing? One may say that they are not now getting exposure to even the basics, down to varicose veins. As a result, the time needed to qualify as a specialist has lengthened with surgical specialities being the worst affected. The qualification time for the Royal Australian College of Surgeons faculty of anaesthetists has increased from four to five years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, inevitable that when Australians are paying 1 1/4 per cent of their income as a Medicare levy, many younger people in particular will be tempted to drop private health insurance and risk not getting ill. On top of this, the Labor Government has taken deliberate actions in the name of cost cutting that have the end result of pricing yet more Australians out of private health insurance and out of the private hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has reduced its contribution to the reinsurance pool of the health funds covering the chronically ill by 99 per cent. It has removed the day bed subsidy of $140m for private hospitals. It has cut the Medicare rebate for private hospital treatment to 75 per cent of the schedule fee. So while the levy is going up, the returns are coming down. The effect of this, of course, is to make premiums more expensive or increase direct patient costs. For example, earlier this year the cost of advanced surgery with a private room at Perth's major private hospital, the St John of God Hospital in Subiaco, was $383 a day of which $35 was not covered by the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, for the sake of total health care, should throw away its ideological blinkers and its ingrained idea that private insurance is just for the rich and recognise that private hospitals and private insurance play an essential role in keeping the health system afloat. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was talking about the Medicare fiasco and the Medicare monster in part of the debate on these taxation Bills. I just wish to continue on some of the concerns that I have about this. They are, namely, that in 1986-87 it was estimated that the total cost of health care in Australia was met by the Medicare levy contributing 16 per cent; by Federal Government general taxation giving 38 per cent; by State Government revenues, a further 34 per cent; while the remaining 12 per cent was met by the health funds. As I say, this is just a monster that is getting out of all control. It should worry this Government that between December 1985 and March 1988 the proportion of Australians with private cover fell from 49 per cent to 47 per cent. While that might not sound a big reduction, it is in fact quite an enormous reduction which simply means that more and more people are in the position of relying on the public sector. We should all take heed of the warning by the chief executive of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association, Mr Russell Schneider: that if all those contributors over 65 years of age left the private funds and relied wholly and solely on Medicare, not only would they be foolish, but then the Australian taxpayer would have to find another $1 billion for the health bill. These older Australians represent 10 per cent of contributors to private funds, but comprise 40 per cent of beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The health insurance industry cannot keep, in effect, supplementing Federal Government health spending, unless a sizeable proportion of younger and healthier Australians maintain private cover. But where is the incentive for them to do so? The incentive just simply is not there and this Government refuses to provide incentives. Week by week almost we are finding that the private health insurance companies are being forced by this Government to put up their rates and, therefore, putting them out of the reach of so many more young Australians. It would seem to be an unwritten rule in this Labor Government that when in doubt over health matters, bash doctors. For months and months we have heard not only the Minister, Dr non-medical Blewett, but also the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, bash doctors ad infinitum. I would like to see the day when they need one. </PARA>
<PARA> Doctors are constantly reviled for daring to exceed the scheduled fee, and the recent proposal by the Australian Medical Association for a new fee schedule based on content rather than time was given a public bucketing by the Minister. That is how much he cares about the content and the quality of health care. The doctors do care about it; it is just a great shame that the Minister does not care about it. Even if the Department is now prepared to consider seriously a well reasoned proposal, it is sad that the Minister reacted critically, almost as a reflex action, instead of first considering the proposal and then reacting. If the general practitioner is to act as a `gatekeeper' in deciding to refer patients to more expensive treatments, he should have every inducement to provide quality rather than quantity in consulting procedure. This is what the patients want and expect and this is what the doctors want to provide without interference from a Minister who could not care less. Continually we get from the Government the propagation of the myth of the rich doctor, with a total lack of concern and comprehension of the problems that are faced by the medical profession. There are very few rich and wealthy general practitioners. They are simply trying to do a job for their patients. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party ignores the fact that since 1984 the schedule fee has increased by 14 per cent compared with an inflation cumulative increase of 36 per cent; yet it still wants to bash doctors and say that they are all wealthy. In New South Wales, for example, an out of hours home visit by a doctor costs $50, compared with $140 for a senior ambulance officer or a plumber, and $260 for an air-conditioning service man. While I find that the services provided by ambulance officers, plumbers and so forth are very valuable, I would not consider that most of them are given in life-threatening situations-other than the ambulance officer, of course. But it is interesting that the ambulance officer does get paid a darn sight more than the doctor. A GP earns $14 per hour less than a primary teacher or deck hand, $3 less than a college of advanced education teacher, and $6 less than a mining engineer. The cost of staff overheads can reduce a doctor's earnings from $153,000 to less than $63,000-before tax, not after tax. A survey of 200 GPs early in 1987 showed that one-third received less than $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA> My time is fast running out. I just conclude by saying that Medicare may be popular with those Australians fortunate enough to avoid serious illness in their family, but that is as far as it goes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before the Senate tonight in a cognate debate include the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988, Income Tax Amendment Bill 1988 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1988. These pieces of legislation cover a range of things of varying complexity, but I think that what is probably most important about them is not so much what they contain, but what they fail to contain as far as increasing equity with regard to tax payment and services received by the community are concerned and, secondly, what they do by way of presumably unintended consequences. I notice that not only will we be looking at some clauses for amendment in these Bills, but so will the Opposition. I see on my desk today that the Government itself is amending part of its legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Income Tax Amendment Bill 1988 amends the Income Tax Act of 1986 to formally impose at the rates declared by the Income Tax (Rates) Act of 1986 the tax payable for the coming financial year. It does so with regard to individuals and trustees generally, trustees of superannuation funds and ineligible approved deposit funds in particular, and also relates to companies, registered organisations, corporate unit trusts, public trading trusts and certain other trusts. However, nowhere in any of this year's tax legislation do we find cuts in tax for ordinary Australians despite cuts to company tax and despite a drop of over 20 per cent in the disposable income for those people who earn average weekly earnings or less over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record, for all it talks about the need for equity, is not a good one in the taxation area. As we have seen in the tax Bills debate last week, the Government has seen fit to increase taxes over the last few years on items bought by ordinary Australian families on a regular basis. Milk and fruit juice, for example, were taxed in previous Budgets. Take-away food containers, Glad Wrap, thick shake mixers and flavoured soy milk have been taxed in this Budget, all with the support of an Opposition which claims that it does not want to interfere with the Labor Government's Budget by amending this legislation in any way at all, but has in the past indicated that it is perfectly happy to do things such as opposing capital gains tax and fringe benefits taxes which, of course, only assisted the wealthier taxpayers to pay less tax, or the failure to have those things in place meant that those groups were able to pay less tax than many in the community on less incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Government in its early years in this place did move in that area of inequity. I acknowledge too that contrary to its concerns about impeding government's budgetary processes and revenue raising measures in the early years the Liberal-National Party Opposition was prepared to oppose or attempt to amend those pieces of legislation-namely, on the fringe benefits tax and on the capital gains tax. But things have changed considerably since then and, quite frankly, a lot of people are fed up with listening to Senator Walsh say that Australia cannot afford tax cuts-that is, ordinary Australian wage and salary earners cannot afford tax cuts-because, he says, we have to dampen consumption expenditure, which places the burden on ordinary Australian families and individuals in that area, and this despite the fact that it is the wealthiest Australians, surely, who have the greatest tendency to spend money on luxury imports. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government is not prepared to cut taxation to individuals, it certainly has been happy to cut back taxation to companies. The only taxpayers who received any significant sort of tax cuts were those on top pay as you earn tax. In 1987 the highest marginal tax rates were reduced from 60c to 49c in the dollar. That was overdue. It is ridiculous when people in this country can lose over half the money that they earn at the top end of their earnings. We need to remember that it is at the top end of their earnings; that marginal tax rates apply at the margins. Perhaps that is not too well understood in the community. People used to complain that they were paying 60c in the dollar as if they paid it from dollar one. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I have vivid memories of being interviewed by a journalist for an Adelaide newspaper who wanted to talk about tax reform generally. When I discussed things such as the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax legislation in terms of general tax reform pointing out that if the Government raised more revenue it would, one hoped-at least in those days-raise the tax free threshold and drop the marginal tax rates. The journalist came back with the extraordinary question of what did I mean by tax free threshold marginal tax rates. Here was a man in his middle twenties who presumably had been earning money from which tax had been deducted for five or six years but did not have the faintest idea how the tax system worked and was writing a major feature piece on tax reform for an Australian newspaper. That ignorance in some sections of the community about exactly where there are tax inequities and where there are not filters through to, or back from-I am not quite sure of the direction of the arrows-the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many very large companies in Australia which pay little or no tax while pensioners lose their tax rebates once their combined income of pension and other earnings is, I think, a little over $10,000. Ordinary Australian families on average weekly earnings and less are certainly paying far more than many Australian companies. Yet this fact is also not known. The Australian Financial Review might run a story about Alan Bond's company earning $354m in 1987-88 and paying no tax because of use of tax havens, negative gearing, transfer pricing and so on, but certainly the average Australians are not being told that. They are therefore not in a position to make any sort of comparison between what they earn and pay tax on and what companies earn and pay tax on. I might add that I do not shed tears of blood or even salt water for people such as Alan Bond who owns the Bond group of companies when they claim that they pay rates and charges of one sort or another and are contributing that way. There is not an Australian family in this country which does not also pay rates and taxes at State and local government level. For that inequity to persist under this Labor Government is one of the greatest indictments that can be directed at it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say very little of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1988 at the moment. It simply imposes the Medicare levy for the financial year commencing 1 July 1988. More importantly, it will increase the level of the income threshold below which the levy is not payable. This will increase from $8,980 to $9,560. The income thresholds above which the Medicare levy becomes payable are higher now than in the previous financial year. The only point I want to raise is to question exactly how the new recommended Australian Medical Association (AMA) fee charges will impact on Australian families. I do not doubt at all that there are some fairly significant inequities in the schedule fee system, but whether what the AMA is proposing will rectify these or just introduce another series of anomalies is anybody's guess. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that there is a serious financial incentive propelling members of the medical profession to see as many patients per day as they can because there is no financial benefit in spending time with patients. A recent study has indicated that many female doctors are significantly worse off than their male colleagues because it is to female general practitioners that many women are now taking themselves and their children for health care. As most people are aware, it is not possible to deal with stress related illnesses or the general health care of a family, particularly children, in a five or 10-minute consultation. Female doctors, who are more prepared it seems than their male colleagues to see women and their children for those 25-minute visits that are necessary, find that they are significantly financially worse off. Certainly, the Government needs to do something other than simply charge by time but I am not sure that the AMA's idea of having the doctor assess the complexity or difficulty of the problem and charge accordingly is the right way to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has some of the greatest complexities of the legislation before us tonight. It also has a number of either unintended consequences or omissions. It extends roll-over relief; that is, there is a deferral of tax liability on capital gains tax on certain transactions including assets transferred from one spouse to another following a marriage breakdown. Therein lies a problem because there is a sort of gap in the middle of all this with rules applying to breakdowns of marriage prior to one period and following another period but not applying in the middle. I will say something more about this later. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments include changes to the substantiation laws and further concessions to the fringe benefits tax legislation. I do not want to go into those. They are fairly straightforward. However, the problems that I want to deal with relate to those roll-over provisions. By and large this legislation indicates that the Government did not get its capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax right in the first place. It needs to do what the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) was castigating me for suggesting we do in the sales tax legislation the other day, namely tinker around the edges. We have before us an acknowledgment by the government essentially that the original legislation was sloppy or at least not properly thought through. There is no doubt at all in my mind that an injustice has resulted. That injustice needs to be corrected. This legislation certainly does not go far enough with regard to assets transferred from one spouse to another following divorce. The roll-over relief arguably should have been available from 20 September 1985. To put this in perspective, I would like to quote from a letter that was sent to me and, I presume, to a number of other honourable senators from a lady who was caught up in this. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA> When capital gains were first included in taxable income in 1985, rollover provisions were enacted for direct transfer of assets from one spouse to another spouse in a marriage breakdown where the transfers were made pursuant to an order of a Family Court or pursuant to a maintenance agreement approved by that Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The rollover provision did not however extend to assets owned indirectly by the `transferor' spouse by means of a trust or company, even though these assets were the subject of many transfer agreements and court orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by clause 46 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Bill before us tonight-</PARA>
<PARA>will apply to indirect asset transfers of this type which occur after 28 January 1988. The effect of the rollover relief to be provided by this clause, is that if the transferred asset was acquired by the company or trustee before 20 September 1985, the spouse receiving the asset will also be treated as if he or she had acquired the asset before that date. </PARA>
<PARA>She says then:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to seek your help to persuade the Government to apply the amendment proposed by clause 46 of the No. 3 Bill to indirect assets transfers of this type resulting from marriage breakdowns, not merely to such transfers after 28 January 1988 but to all transfers of this kind after 20 September 1985, the date when the capital gains tax was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>If clause 46 is enacted in its present form, she says-and I agree with her-it will be clearly discriminatory. This will be the case because a number of good Australian citizens, including the lady who wrote this letter, who pay their fair share of Australian taxes just happen to have acquired assets from these kinds of indirect transfers of property resulting from the unfortunate breakdown of their marriages between 20 September 1985 and 28 January 1988. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We, the unfortunate citizens, will be subject to a capital gains tax in the event if we now decide to, essentially for family or personal reasons, sell the assets acquired. However, those fortunate citizens whose marriage breakdown occur after the 28 January 1988 will enjoy a tax free gain in the same circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>As she points out, there is absolutely no justification for this gap in the middle of people being picked up and treated in the way in which groups both prior to that date in 1985 and subsequent to the date in 1988 are being treated. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further problem with regard to roll-over relief from capital gains for land converted from a Crown lease to freehold, and the particular case that has been drawn to my attention relates to E. L. Yencken Pty Ltd and results from some negotiations over land in South Melbourne currently being leased from the Crown and the fact that the Victorian Government is not offering the whole site that the company currently occupies under a Crown lease but part of it and an adjoining piece of land in substitution. We believe there should be an amendment to this system which does not compel the Commissioner of Taxation to exempt from capital gains tax a roll-over of Crown lease land converted to freehold when there is a substantial difference between the land leased and the land subsequently bought, but gives the Commissioner the option of granting the exemption from capital gains tax. This could be done by including in the legislation other relevant circumstances that the Commissioner in exercising his or her discretion must have regard to.</PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), a sort of hotchpotch of whatever the Government left out of previous legislation in this area. It gives effect to concessional changes to the application of fringe benefits tax with regard to remote area housing, and a number of proposals announced in the May economic statement of this year are put into effect in this Bill. These include changes to depreciation, prepaid expenses, termination of section 26aaa and the pensioner rebate. The Bill also gives effect to a number of issues relating to non-cash business benefits, and this is where the major problem occurs. The Government issued a press release on 4 February 1985 announcing that it would tax non-cash benefits that are in the nature of income. The Government got around to introducing the legislation which is now before the Senate in November of 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats and, I think, other members on this side of the House have warned the Government before about this increasing tendency to legislate by press release. Every time it happens we say, `This is appalling. It should not happen this way. It is causing confusion in the industries concerned'. The last lot related to the insurance industry, which was in total confusion for months on end. Each time we say, `Don't do it again'. This time we on this side of the House have just about had it. </PARA>
<PARA> Three and a half years later the Government gets around to putting into legislation something it promised would come into effect by way of non-cash business benefits. When I saw that provision I thought that perhaps it was a complicated piece of legislation; maybe the gurus up there in the drafting office or the Treasurer's office or the Taxation Office or wherever it is these things are done have really had to extend their little grey cells at some length to come up with this proposal. But that is not the case. The provision covers about a page and a half in the Bill and can hardly be justified as being excessively complex to draft. Incidentally, the gobbledegook that goes with the Bill by way of what is laughingly called an explanatory memorandum is of no help at all. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, as the Leader of the Australian Democrats I recently sent letters to both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about this problem of legislating by press release and made suggestions as to the guidelines. What we did, unashamedly, was to pick up the guidelines issued by the Law Council of Australia, changing them in only one respect, and that was recommending that a maximum of three months may elapse between the press release and the legislation if the Government wants support from the Australian Democrats for future pieces of legislation by press release. The Law Council of Australia suggested one month but in this case more than 3 1/2 years have elapsed. In that time the Government has undertaken tax reform of an extensive and complex type; introduced a fringe benefit tax operative from 1 July 1986, which did not cover this issue, despite the press release of 5 February 1985; and fiddled around at the margins in other areas. So we recommended that the Government have a close look at the letter from the Law Council of Australia and the recommendations, bearing in mind that we-the Australian Democrats and, I hope, the Opposition-support those guidelines. We are prepared to give the Government three months after the date of the announcement for introducing the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally unrealistic to expect all sorts of people, not just major companies who can afford the services of lawyers and accountants, to fight their way through this legislation and the explanatory memorandum. Ordinary Australians are often picked up by this provision, and indeed, one of the groups of people that have been most concerned, if not actually frightened out of their wits by this legislation, are the women who sell Avon, Nutrimetics, presumably Tupperware and similar products, they will quite possibly be picked up by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said a minute ago, as if it were not bad enough that this has taken 3 1/2 years to get to us, there are very real problems of understanding the gobbledegook in the explanatory memorandum. Page 41 of the explanatory memorandum deals with some of the most important areas of clause 13, the non-cash business benefits clause. We then get to the question of arm's length value. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>By paragraph 21a (2) (a) the amount to be included as assessable income is the arm's length value of the non-cash benefit less any amount contributed by the recipient in acquiring the benefit. In calculating the arm's length value of a benefit, paragraph 21A (2) (b) operates to disregard any conditions or limitations that might otherwise preclude the placing of a monetary value on the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> arms length value', in relation to a non-cash business benefit, is defined to mean the amount the recipient of the benefit would have paid to the provider for the benefit in a relationship where the recipient and provider were strangers to each other and who bore no special duty, obligation or relation to each other. In cases where a value cannot be placed on the benefit by the use of this test, the Commissioner is entitled to assign a reasonable amount as being the arm's length value of the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> `non-cash business benefit' is defined to mean benefits provided after 4 February 1985 in the form of property or services in any business relationship. As the new section 21a only applies to benefits that are income according to ordinary concepts, benefits received in a personal or private capacity would not constitute non-cash benefits for purposes of this section. A Christmas gift by a retailer to a customer would be an example of a private benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate to ask why. The answer to that rhetorical question is that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation said so. Presumably, Easter bonuses get picked up, but Christmas ones do not. </PARA>

Although the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), as a lawyer, probably does, I, as a mere ordinary member of Parliament do not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken almost four years from the date of the announcement to come up with not only the legislation but also this explanation of the legislation which will affect, among others, about 25,000 Avon sales agents, 98 per cent of whom are women and 98 per cent of whom earn below $5,100 which, as I am sure everybody in the chamber, including Senator Tate, realises, is the tax free threshold. What exactly are they going to be asked to pay tax on-salt and pepper shakers and whatever other bonuses are provided to them? How are Avon representatives-I do not mean this in any demeaning way, because I suspect that it applies even to company directors or they would not employ tax accountants and tax lawyers-and ordinary people engaged in these activities going to know or understand the contents of a press release issued in February 1985 and know their obligations under it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Senator Messner asks how they will value salt and pepper shakers. One wonders exactly who will make that assessment. I get very angry about this sort of thing. We are hitting ordinary people trying to stretch family budgets that have been hard hit by government actions in other areas. The disposable income of ordinary Australian families has dropped by 20 per cent in real terms. So we have women who believe that they should be at home when their children are at home and, once they are at school, they use the daytime hours to go out there working for Nutrimetics, Avon, Tupperware or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, companies such as the Bond Corporation-the twenty-fifth largest company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, with interests in brewing, property resources and the media-are paying no tax this year or next year. In fact, next year we will probably give that company something back by way of a little present for being able to find the most ingenious ways of getting out of paying company tax. That is not the only company which is limiting its contribution to Consolidated Revenue and, in the meantime, using transfer pricing, negative gearing, foreign-financed takeovers in particular, South Pacific tax havens and so on. We are depleting, through the actions of such companies, Consolidated Revenue to such an extent that we have governments seriously cutting back on expenditure in health, housing and education. Qintex Australia Ltd pays 0.11 per cent in tax and the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd pays 0.43 per cent. The Bond Corporation was listed as paying 0.97 per cent, but I saw in an article in the Australian Financial Review that it will not pay anything at all. That hardly justifies Senator Messner's assertion that this is a high taxing government. It certainly is not in the area of company taxation. Until the Government does something about negative gearing, this situation will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office has to come to terms with transfer pricing and negative gearing, particularly when it is associated with foreign-financed loans. Maybe that way we will get around to some sort of equity. (Extension of time granted) What all of this amounts to is that the Government has some very strange priorities. On the one hand, it allows some companies to get away year after year with paying less than a cent in the dollar tax and, on the other hand, it chases after Avon ladies on very small incomes, asking them to accept that the Government, in the interests of equity, has to tax token awards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other areas where it appears that the Government is getting carried away by its own enthusiasm and in the wrong direction. I understand that the Tax Office is currently considering taxing the Australian Federation of University Women-South Australia Inc., on its earnings from hiring out academic wear, despite the fact that the proceeds of these earnings are used to award bursaries and prizes to men and women. It is not a large money making concern and the Tax Office admits that it is a borderline case. But these women are very worried that they will lose a lot of the capacity to provide the sorts of scholarships to men and women wanting to go on with university study that they have provided in the past. They keep a stock of academic wear which they hire to graduates and graduands at reasonable rates for formal ceremonies. The money they have raised so far during 1988 has been about $1,400. It is invested and the interest earned is used for awards. I would have thought that that was the sort of thing from which the Government should not be taking an incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise deals with the treatment of prepaid expenses which extend over 13 months from the date of payment. An accountant has written to us-and I presume to the Government and probably the Opposition-because he believes that the change will adversely affect his clients; namely, those truckies who are members of the Transport Workers Union of Australia. He argues that the problem occurs when a prime mover or trailer is traded in on a new prime mover and the sale consideration of the old equipment is used as an up-front rental payment on the new prime mover lease. Under the present legislation capital gains tax is payable on the profit on sale of the old prime mover, but a tax deduction is allowed in full on the up-front rental payment derived from the sale of the old equipment at the time of the commencement of the lease. The proposed legislation will tax the capital gains at the time of the trade in and allow only the proportion of the up-front rental as relates to the expired period of the lease, divided by the full term in any one year, less the amount already claimed on the lease in previous years. In other words, instead of paying little or no capital gains tax on the sale of the old prime mover, the owner-driver will now have to pay a substantial amount of capital gains tax because he-it is almost always a man-cannot get the full deduction for the up-front rental payment in the same year. Many owner-drivers, therefore, will not be able to afford to upgrade into new trucks. This will make the industry less efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> That is just another example of governments changing tax laws and increasing problems. Sometimes, with the best intentions in the world, there are unintended consequences. I ask the Government to consider either amending its own legislation or supporting amendments moved on this side of the House in order to correct some of the worst anomalies and the more damaging unintended consequences and, in particular, to consider low income earners who are supplementing family incomes, universities that are trying to provide a benefit to potential students, owner-drivers and people who divorced in the period between 1985 and 1988 and to make the system far more equitable for them. </PARA>

<PARA> I wish particularly to address the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) this evening. This Bill seeks to put into effect proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act. These amending Bills will add to the existing encyclopaedia of tax laws in this country that have undoubtedly tired the most diligent of accountants and tax lawyers. To see the tax Act today really makes a lie of the very boastful claim of this Government that it has streamlined and simplified the tax laws of this country because it is forever changing them and bringing in amendments to this House to cover up its utter incompetence in this field, and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) knows it. I can see him smirking. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an example of one of those amendments this evening in the amendments to non-cash business benefits. This Bill seeks to implement a proposal-as all the other speakers have said in this House-that was announced on 4 February 1985-some 3 1/2 years ago. The Government's administrative incompetence has now reached the stage where it is making a mockery of the law. That accusation is backed up by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. A report of that Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee again questions how a person may be expected to know the content of a law when the terms of that law are not publicly available, but may only be ascertained from a reading of Ministerial media announcements, or, in this case, a draft bill which was modified in content before its presentation to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee drew subclause 53 (19) of the Bill to the attention of the Senate as, due to its retrospective effect, it `may be considered to unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties'. Is the Minister concerned about that report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee? I also ask the Minister to take strong heed of the Law Council of Australia's condemnation of this legislation by press release. The Law Council, like the Committee, has repeatedly urged the Government, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to stop using media releases to usurp the legislative role of Parliament in a way that makes a mockery of the rule of law. To this end the Opposition has moved an amendment that backs up the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Law Council of Australia. That amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>condemns the Government for its practice of `government by press release' which can cause otherwise legitimate legislation to be called into question because of the unacceptable retrospectivity thus introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Honestly, how can any business possibly operate under this type of administration? We have already witnessed the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) bringing into the Parliament a shemozzle under the name of corporations package. So bumbling was it that it needed up to 280 amendments only four months after it was introduced into this House. So poor was the drafting of that package of legislation, so uneasy did the Senate feel about, that it shunted it off to a committee even after the 280 amendments had been dealt with. The Attorney-General's announcement of his pending retirement from politics really means that he has dropped his bundle, all at the expense of the taxpayers. Now the business community must endure another incompetent drafting exercise by this Government, because that press release in 1985 did not provide sufficient details on what the make-up of the legislation might contain, and it left business absolutely in the lurch. Clearly the Opposition is saying that the legislation should not be retrospective but should apply only to the benefits provided on or after the day of its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting that one of the most significant amendments before the Senate discriminates against the productive and enterprising sector of small business, that is, the termination of the general accelerated depreciation concessions allowing write-off of most plant and equipment over three or five years, and the special five year depreciation arrangements for storage facilities for hay, grain, fodder and for primary production plant and equipment. This change to the depreciation provisions comes on top of the abolition of the investment allowance only some 12 months ago. The Government's feeble argument is that these changes are due simply to the fact that it is levelling the playing field and that it has offset these changes against the reduction in the company tax from 49c in the dollar to 39c. But the facts are that unincorporated small businesses, which make up half of small business, are not included in this levelling of the playing field because they do not pay those company rates. They are not incorporated so they cannot take advantage of the 39 per cent company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, does the Government really believe that the family farmers, who contribute so much to the welfare of this nation and who are going to lose from the abolition of this so-called depreciation concession, pay a company tax rate of 39c in the dollar? Obviously the Government's argument has no legs to it at all. What it is doing, and what we have seen it do over the last six years, is once again hitting out at that sector, the farmers and the small business people, because they do not fit into its corporate state strategy. Yet ironically it is this sector that is holding up the economy today, that keeps the economy afloat. </PARA>
<PARA> So I utterly reject the claim that we hear so much from the other side of the House, that the Government is continually levelling the playing field. What it does not realise-although it might-is that it has flattened the main players, the small business people and the farmers. The oft asked question is: Why does the Government hate the farmers? It never bothers to answer that, and I think that is because the farmers do not vote for them and nor does the small business sector of the economy. To this end the Opposition has moved an amendment, which reads. </PARA>
<PARA>notes that this Government's so-called tax reforms invariably involve simply offsetting tax reductions in one area by tax increases in others, as witnessed in this Bill by the termination of the 5/3 depreciation arrangement to offset a reduction in the corporate tax rate;</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's attack on this sector, which I have outlined, continues by its increasing of the provisional tax uplift factor from 11 per cent to 12 per cent. The uplift factor is probably best known to those who are provisional taxpayers. It sets a percentage increase for the basis of calculating provisional tax by taxpayers who do not self-assess by seeking a variation of provisional tax on the basis of an estimate of income for the relevant years. The real point is that this tax increase was not mentioned in the Budget, that the Government has simply brought this tax amendments in to raise what is calculated to be an extra $100m. So in fact it is just another tax raising effort by stealth. The Opposition's amendment condemns outright this method of tax raising, and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>notes that the Government continues its propensity for taxation by stealth by again unaccountably raising the provisional tax uplift factor;</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment Bill proposed by the Government and the style in which it has been introduced are all part of the Government's great tax grab, so aptly put by Herald journalist, Terry McCrann. This Government from its first day in office has been cheating and mugging the farmers, small business people and the householders of Australia. The Opposition's amendment has spelt out this position quite clearly. It notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly that is the way in which this Government will go down in history. Is it any wonder that the Government is so sensitive to the McCrann articles? Certainly the Government is very sensitive when seeking to explain its taxation laws and polices because it simply cannot defend them. These policies are hurting the PAYE taxpayer. For example, in 1983 a single income family on average weekly earnings had a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent. Today, that same family's marginal tax rate is 40 per cent. Another way of looking at the Government's tax record is that the income tax on individuals shows a 63.7 per cent increase, while inflation has risen by 43.5 per cent. They are both staggering figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the first day of this Government's wretched existence it has dragged an extra $8 billion per annum from ordinary taxpayers by way of bracket creep. Over two million taxpayers have been pushed into the top tax brackets, and it is estimated that a million more taxpayers will be pushed into the top tax bracket. That is how this Government has been funding its much-touted budget surplus-not through the proper discipline of cutting its own expenditure, but by increased taxes. Yet the Treasurer, working on the principle of `Tell them anything and they'll believe it', said on 11 October to the British-Australian Chamber of Commerce in London that the:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . move into surplus was not achieved as a result of revenue increases. It has come entirely from outlays reduction. </PARA>
<PARA>Just judging by the words uttered by the Treasurer, Australians have every right to be concerned that their much promised and much needed tax cuts will not be delivered. All we get from this Government is falsehoods. The people of Australia have further reason to doubt that tax cuts will ever be delivered when they hear the words of the Leader of the Senate, Senator Button, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Some people have talked enormous figures in terms of tax cuts. I don't think they are affordable. I mean, we are really not in a position where we can indulge ourselves too much at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button and his colleagues on the Government benches have been indulging themselves with Australian taxpayers money for the past six years. Sadly, the much promised and much needed tax cuts, as we see from the words of Senator Button and the Treasurer, are in grave doubt because of this Government's incompetence in managing the economy and its utter unwillingness to cut its own expenditure. It has been unwilling to drop off its hangers-on who have leached the Budget and the Government and the Government has not the guts to drop them. We know from Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, that at least 200 programs could be eliminated without any worry. Why does the Government not do something for the Australian taxpayer, for the householder, for the family man? I know that Senator Tate is a decent Minister who cares for the family, but he never stands up and defends it. He is always being squashed and being put under the thumb of the left wing of the Labor Party; he is too frightened to stick up his head. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflation rate clearly shows the vulnerability into which the economy has lurched. The inflation rate which was estimated in the Budget to be 4.5 per cent is now running at 7.3 per cent and rising undoubtedly. Interest rates are well above what the Government wants or estimated and 90-day bills are running at 14 per cent or thereabouts, which is certainly too high. Home loan interest certainly has shot over the 14 to 15 per cent mark and the current account deficit is running at an annual rate of $13 billion-way above the Government's estimate of $9.5 billion, and adding to the foreign debt of $115 billion. Without doubt, all these events have placed the tax cuts in doubt. Certainly the $56 week needed to restore the ordinary Australian standard of living to what it was six years ago will never be achieved. Of course, people would have to have been pretty gullible to believe that they would ever get tax cuts, but as those cuts were promised, people had their hopes. However, those cuts are certainly now on the back burner. I feel very sad and sorry for the ordinary Australian taxpayer who has put his faith in this Government in one or two elections only to find that they have been let down each time. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . notes that the Treasurer has failed to meet his responsibilities in respect to the administration of the taxation system and has hidden behind the rhetoric of the Commissioner of Taxation and encouraged the undermining of the rule of law in taxation matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious amendment and it has a serious intent. There is a growing perception in the business community, and indeed in the general community, that the Australian Taxation Office has become utterly uncaring and lacks compassion towards very genuine cases. Senator Haines has outlined to the Senate several genuine cases, but the Taxation Office is carrying out a planned and directed agenda for and on behalf of this Government, and in particular a political agenda on behalf of Paul Keating. That perception is widespread and is backed by the Australian Society of Chartered Accountants, and indeed the Australian Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has always been accused of redrawing the line between the executive arm of government and its Public Service, which is entrenched in the Westminster system. It is fair to say that this Government has often been accused of making several political appointments. Politicising the Public Service is of no great concern to some members of the Government and does not worry them. This grave concern by the community towards the Taxation Office has been highlighted of late by the raid upon institutions such as Citicorp. Senate Estimates Committee C, of which I am a member, took the opportunity to question the Tax Commissioner extensively on the Citicorp raid. The Commissioner woefully failed to dispel community concern. Indeed, his attitude was oblivious to the community feeling. He did not seem to know what that attitude was. He had no perception of what I was saying. That Estimates Committee seemed a very fitting place for the Commissioner to make such a statement, to dispel such a perception. Instead, we saw the Commissioner lose his cool and throw a tantrum. The Government cannot ignore this feeling in the community, and it is felt it has broken an important Westminster tradition. A major repair job is needed. The Commissioner has taken the Taxation Office to is lowest ebb and has lost the confidence of many people in the community. The country is being weighed down not only by an array of new taxes, but also by the complexities of the tax laws. Hardworking Australians do not deserve this type of treatment and are reacting strongly against the tax system and to the Treasurer's method of apportioning taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last four years the overwhelming volume of legislation adversely affecting the everyday lives of the majority of Australians has been a plethora of legislation increasing the level of taxation, both direct and indirect. Apart from legislative tax increases, we continue to see the destructive effects of bracket creep, which I will refer to later. The Government has made great play about the domestic Budget surplus. The question is: How is it achieved? It has been achieved this year by a reduction in payments to the States and by selling off a few assets, but by far the most significant means has been increased taxation. The Government has a preoccupation with tax gathering, and the effect is that we have in Australia, of necessity, an attitude that we must protect our savings at all costs. Malcolm Fraser in 1983 was derided by the Australian Labor Party and by the press for saying that if Labor were elected people should hide their savings under the bed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan will remember that. How prophetic those words have proven to be. In other countries which suffer from instability or risk the loss of the accumulation of possessions, there is a flight to gold. We have all seen it over the years in politically disturbed countries, because it is seen that gold holds its value and can be used as a universal currency. Since Labor has been in power Australians have developed a similar mentality, hence the rush to invest in real estate. This flight to preserve savings, coupled with high interest rates and inflation, is the major reason for the rise in real estate values. I think it is important to make that parallel between people's attitudes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only sensible tax measure introduced by this Government has been dividend imputation, which removed the disincentive of double taxation, although I might say that I believe it was done in reverse. I believe that what is needed in this country is an investment attitude and not a consumption spending attitude. If this Government had had political guts, which it did not, it would not-as Senator Walsh would know-have gone the way it did in regard to dividend imputation but would have taxed in the hands of the taxpayer. Notwithstanding dividend imputation and the reduction of company tax to 39 per cent, the perception of the average Australian, very regrettably, is that his savings are safer in real estate than in wealth and thus job creating business investment. Hence we see all the investment by financial institutions and by those in the private sector in buildings in our major capital cities but not in the real wealth creating and job creating manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire-I note he is the only Labor speaker in this debate, apart from the Minister, who has no option-studiously avoided mentioning the incredible and unacceptable tax rip-off by the highest taxing government in Australia's peacetime history. The Budget figures indicate that by June 1989, after six years of hard Labor, inflation in Australia will have increased by 51 per cent. So much for the accord. The real figure is probably higher than the one I have given because I have used the low estimate of 4.5 per cent in the 1988-89 Budget figures. Inflation in Japan over the same period was of the order of 6.5 per cent. So inflation in Australia has increased by 51 per cent and in Japan by 6.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax on individuals will have increased from $23 billion to $48 billion-a massive 108 per cent on personal income tax. Tax on companies, including the fringe benefits tax, will have increased from $5 billion to $11 billion-a massive 120 per cent. So much for the remarks of Senator Haines, who has a habit of coming in here and saying that companies are not taxed. She never defines what she means. She never describes the basis for that statement. If companies are paying tax on their taxable income they will have been paying it at 49 per cent and this year at 39 per cent, because that is what the tax rate is. Senator Haines talks about negative gearing and overseas borrowing. What she says in that regard is quite true, particularly as it relates to overseas borrowing. She never queries why people borrow overseas. It is because, if the interest rate here is 16, 17 or 18 per cent and people can borrow overseas at 6 or 7 per cent and make some sort of a payment to cover the exchange risk, it is worth it. Our interest rate is too high. Sales tax collections have increased from $3.5 billion to $8.6 billion since the Labor Party came to power-a massive 145 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> The standard of living of Australians, particularly families, has been destroyed by this Government, yet Senator Maguire in this debate has made quite misleading statements about the Government boosting living standards. He might be fooling himself and his colleagues but he is not fooling the public. This Government does not realise just how out of touch it has become. People such as Senator Maguire can talk until they are blue in the face, but average Australians know when they make their mortgage payments, when they go to the supermarkets and when they pay their taxes that they are a lot worse off now than they have ever been in their lives, and they know the reasons. They know that it is because of the action of a rapacious, out of touch Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently returned from a visit to South Korea, as part of a parliamentary delegation. In a short period of 15 years that country has moved from being a Third World country to being an industrial giant in South-East Asia and the world. It has come from nothing to be the world's third largest steel producer and third largest manufacturer of microchips. After a debate here the other day a comment was made to me by one of the Labor Ministers. He said, `They are lucky because they have just come into the industry. They are able to start afresh'. I would have thought that the opposite was true. If we have been making steel in this country for 80 to 90 years, with all the raw materials we have-iron ore, coal, manganese and so on-why on earth are we not far ahead of the rest of the world? It is a good question. Korea does not have the natural resource wealth of Australia and, in fact, is a large importer of our raw materials. On an industrialised basis, compared with that country Australia is a Third World country, and we have to wake up to that fact. For instance, Korea's net foreign debt is around $30 billion and decreasing at the rate of $1 billion a month. Australia's net foreign debt is of the order of $90 billion and increasing at the rate of $1 billion a month. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day I returned to this country the leader in the newspaper in my home State of Queensland was a headline story stating that, under the legislation we are now debating, Avon and Tupperware ladies who had received a prize of a trip to some holiday resort any time after 4 February 1985 would be taxed on the value of that prize. What sort of priority is that? Instead of concentrating urgently on the major defects-our lack of productivity, restrictive work practices, industrial anarchy, lack of incentive to invest, inflation and level interest rates-the Government goes after the Avon and Tupperware ladies, shop attendants and baby-sitters. The areas I referred to are those which must be addressed to prevent our heading down the path of further decline in our standards of living for generations. Senator Walsh, who is the Minister on duty, talked about the Argentinean road. He was right. We must get our priorities right. </PARA>
<PARA> I was taken by the recent remarks of a reporter on the Philippine Star. We know of the difficulties in that country. It is worth quoting what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to export more, import less, improve our productivity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It sounds familiar, does it not? He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>and yet all we get is talk, talk and committees. We must be the greatest saliva slingers on the planet. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter, Max Saliven, was talking about the Philippines. He could just as easily have been talking about this Labor Government in Australia. I could not see any difference. We have heard it all before. I repeat what he said: Export more, import less, become more productive; yet all we hear is talk. </PARA>
<PARA> The industries which keep this country afloat are mining, primary industry and, more recently, tourism. That is all we have. All these industries are heavily dependent on a fickle international market. Yet the vast majority of tax legislation brought in by this Government has adversely affected those very industries. It says, `Do not worry about the inefficient ones. Let us go for the efficient ones and make them inefficient'. Fringe benefits tax is a good example. It was introduced to catch people in capital cities receiving payment in kind instead of wages. I do not disapprove of that. But whom does it hit? Quite unjustly, it hits-in another unintended consequence, I presume-mining, primary industry and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill goes some way to rectifying the effect of fringe benefits tax on mining and primary industry. But to highlight the complexity of the tax system it should be noted that simply to vary the amortisation of the taxable value of fringe benefits relating to remote area home ownership schemes requires nine pages of amending legislation. I believe that I would touch a core of sympathy in the heart of Senator Walsh on this matter. The other day I heard him talking in this place about the total complexity of legislation and the way it is drafted. It is incredible that it takes nine pages to amend a tax which should never have been imposed in these areas in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an amendment to the depreciation provisions in respect of mining plant and equipment which will add another element of risk and uncertainty to any decision to invest in a mining project. Plant and equipment can now be depreciated over only seven years instead of, for example, the life of the mine. Again I remind honourable senators that if it were not for the mining industry I have no idea what state this country would be in. If we go back in history we will find that it was the mining industry that kicked this country off. We must move into capital intensive development not only in new mineral projects but, hopefully, also in further processing. </PARA>
<PARA> The North West Shelf is a good example of billions of dollars invested in a project which will make a great contribution to this country. Its export price for gas is linked to the oil price. The oil price has collapsed and it is anyone's guess when it will recover. Whether it will be next year or five or 10 years down the track, I do not know. Under this legislation a lack of profit in its early years of operation will mean that it will not be able to depreciate its plant and equipment against future profits. I would be surprised if even this Government intended that that should occur. I ask it to restore the depreciation provisions to mining in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of this speech I mentioned that I would talk about bracket creep. The section of the community which bears most of the brunt of the tax burden is the one-income family. I think it is worth referring to the various reports on the effects that this Government has had in recent years on the one-income family. In today's Daily Telegraph I noted that Margaret Gibson, a tax expert with Price Waterhouse, drew attention to that. She spelt it out very clearly in a way that people listening to this debate not only would understand but also would relate to because they have had that experience. She quoted the example of John Citizen, who in 1981-82, with a wife and a two-year-old child, had the average yearly salary of $17,472. She assumed that the wife had a deposit in a building society. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 John Citizen's primary tax would have been $4,249, with his top marginal rate of tax being 32 per cent. Through available rebates, including a spouse rebate of $830, a concessional expenditure rebate of $131 and the health insurance rebate, his tax bill would have been reduced to $3,128. In other words, his average tax rate in 1981-82, just before this Government came into power, was 18 per cent. There we have it: the average wage earner with a wife and a two-year-old child had an average tax rate of 18 per cent. Margaret Gibson contrasted that with his income tax liability for 1988, which would have risen to $6,859 simply because his salary in 1981-82 kept up with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> This taxpayer would be liable to a Medicare levy of $339, being 1.25 per cent of his taxable income. As a consequence, his tax bill for 1988 would be $6,207. His salary has risen from $17,000 to $27,000. His tax bill has risen from $3,128 to $6,207; it has doubled. While his income has gone up by some 50 per cent--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have quoted actual figures then and now. The important point is that, while his average tax rate in 1981-82 was 18 per cent, in 1987-88 it is 23 per cent. That is for the average weekly earner. It is interesting to note that, while his wage increase has been in keeping with inflation, the Government is now taking 23 per cent of an average taxpayer's income, compared with 18 per cent in 1982. That is what is commonly called tax bracket creep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice from an article in today's Melbourne Herald that the Federal Government's own advisory group has revealed how the Keating tax system is hurting badly the majority of ordinary wage and salary earners, especially families on average and below average incomes. The sorts of figures that I have just referred to prove this point. The study undertaken by the Economic Planning Advisory Council shows that the average family's tax has leapt more than 20 per cent in real terms since the election of the Hawke Government. These are the people who are crying out for help. These are the people who are voting against the Labor Government at elections such as the Oxley by-election. They do so because they are hurting. They are the people who cannot save and who have difficulty in making ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> A few months ago the Catholic Leader, a weekly newspaper in Queensland, which I believe has nationwide coverage, ran a series of stories on various families. Most of those families have three children, the wife does not work outside the home and the family income is around $500 to $600 a week. In fact, the example I took note of was a Telecom employee whose gross salary was $600 a week. That family had difficulties in making ends meet because of inflation, interest rates and bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> The families detailed their weekly expenses and how their income was eked out to pay for food, transport, rates, electricity et cetera. Some claimed that they did not have enough to buy steak every week. But they all had the same message for this Government. The comments made by these families included: `The family has borne the brunt of economic change'; `We'd like to see assistance through tax measures to people with dependants'; `There is no assistance now in tax deductions, which there used to be years ago'; `There is no recognition at all of the best resource we have, our people'. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to support in particular the amendment to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which was moved by my colleague Senator Messner. That amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) this is the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right. We put them on and the Government is cutting them off. We provided the incentives but the Government is cutting them off. Hopefully, some incentives will be kept so that some of the foreign income can be earned to enable the Government to pay off its bills. As I said, this Government is hell-bent on removing incentives. By doing so, the Government is denying primary industries the opportunity to keep up with technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where a farmer could write off over three or five years a machine producing assessable income, such as a tractor or a combine harvester, whether it was built in Australia or it was a costly import, now, of course, we are to return to the practice of writing it off over a period defined in a schedule by the Commissioner of Taxation. This write-off schedule is more in keeping with the 1950s. I believe that the schedule was written at a time when there was less area under cultivation which resulted in less use of machines. This meant, of course, that the machines had a longer life. As I said, the schedule was probably drawn up in the 1950s or even the 1940s and, as far as I know, it has not been updated. </PARA>
<PARA> With increasing acreages being used to grow crops and with more land being cleared and harvested during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the life of machines has declined. But, at the same time, the Government is increasing the write-off period. A major consequence of this is not only the removal of the incentive to purchase new plant and keep up with technology, but also a decrease in the supply of good used machinery for farmers who are not in a position to buy new machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators do not believe what I am saying, one has only to look at several cases in Western Australia where many machinery dealers are importing good used American machines. This may make good business sense to them, it may provide the cheaper version of the machines that farmers are looking for but, of course, there are inherent dangers. One of those dangers is the importation of noxious weeds from America that probably are not in Australia if the imported machines are not cleaned properly. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, the biggest tragedy is the loss of jobs in Australia both in the retailing of the less than new machines and the servicing of those machines as well. Machinery used by the mining and exploration industry has suffered the same fate with the removal of certain write-off conditions. One of the most farcical situations is the removal of the right to write off over five years storage facilities for hay, grain and fodder. We are talking about an agricultural sector that has gone through droughts and all sorts of ups and downs and disasters in the last 12 months. The Government has had to dip in and provide carry-on finance and even social welfare to build up income. Here we have this same government which encourages, and rightly so, the conservation of fodder and water, and it takes away the incentive for the farmers and pastoral owners to help themselves through the conservation of fodder, et cetera. The same goes for the storage of grain, especially in the eastern States. More and more grain is being kept on farms, especially in New South Wales. Because of the run down railway systems and the wheat handling that we had under the Unsworth Government, I suppose it is a logical practice. But it hardly seems logical to remove the incentive to build those facilities by the sorts of incentives that we had through depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the amazing side effects of the write-off provisions is the fact that each taxpayer has to elect, on a year by year basis, which of the two depreciation methods-prime cost or diminishing value-is to apply to that year. The method elected will continue to apply for the life of the plant throughout its depreciation life in the hands of that taxpayer. There is nothing wrong with that, but why must that basis of depreciation remain for the whole year? In other words, if one buys extra machines, in addition to one's first, unless I am wrong, I presume that every item of plant one buys that year has to be written off on the same basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I was waiting for a comment from the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh)-but obviously I shall not get one-as to whether I was right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the financial impact of this change in depreciation, one will see that there will be a revenue saving of $190m in 1989-90, $450m in 1990-91, $1,030m in 1991-92, and $1,650m in 1992-93. These may be admirable savings, but it will be at the expense of many jobs in Australia and the use of better machines, thus we shall miss out on technology that keeps us up with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week Senator Maguire told us that these provisions for write-off and depreciation will be more than made up by the cut in the corporate tax from 49c in the dollar. I do not know where Senator Maguire gets his figures from but if a census were done of the agricultural sector throughout Australia, it would be found that very few people-this was pointed out by a previous speaker-work under an incorporated company system. A farmer is likely to buy more plant in a boom year when he is paying tax at a rate of 49c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the elimination of section 26aaa. I commend the Government on this move because it will remove an anomaly. I spoke on this anomaly last year, when, during the market boom, many quick gains were made in some share deals, and many were lost on others. But the trouble was that under section 26aaa whereas share gains were taxed, share losses were not able to be written off against that. The only way that a share trader could claim losses at the time was to claim them against capital gains in other areas and in the future-and they may or may not be around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he is classified as a share trader-that is right. The fear I hold is that many taxpayers are locked into the law as it stood last year-in other words, after the crash and until this section 26aaa alteration. I think we will find taxpayers who are locked into that situation as the elimination of section 26aaa came into effect on 25 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said earlier that I gave an example in this chamber last year of how a taxpayer could have finished the year with no profit or, indeed, a loss in share trading if it had gone as I have said. I hope that the Government is looking at this problem. This shift from taxing under section 26aaa and taxing under capital gains provisions will cost revenue income a mere $5m in 1988-89 and $30m in 1989-90. This is the extent to which the Treasury would have ripped off those taxpayers if that provision had not been changed. I commend the Government. To show that I knew what I was talking about on 21 April 1988, I have an extract of what I said then in a debate on matters of public interest and I seek leave to have that extract of my speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The extract read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to move onto a different matter, that is, the taxing of share profits under section 26aaa of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I will quote a brief passage in a letter to me from the Taxpayers Association of Western Australia. I will quote straight from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA> The Perth office have indicated that they are sympathetic to the view that short term speculative losses should be allowed as a deduction however, although they have had continuous liaison with Canberra, their efforts have been unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the Taxation Office are shortly to issue assessments to taxpayers whereby profits on disposal of property within 12 months are assessed under Section 26aaa and losses on disposal of property-</PARA>
<PARA>which includes shares-</PARA>
<PARA>within 12 months are treated as a capital loss. Take the simple example of a person on fairly average wages-a clerk somewhere, or a truck driver, a miner or something like that-on around $25,000. Under the pay as you earn (PAYE) system he is up for $6,682. But what if he made a $30,000 profit on one share transaction. Let us say he had a couple of thousand dollars to invest just before the share boom last year. A lot of people working at the mines or in solicitors and accountants' offices, got the bug and if they got on to a good issue they could quite easily have made such a profit-and I know some who did, although I am using the figure of $30,000 to make it easier. So this person bought these shares and then made a $30,000 profit. Then, of course, got the bug a bit more and decided to carry on in the market-and then lost that $30,000 in another share transaction. His effective balance after the dealings was nil. In other words, he made no money and he lost no money, so one would expect that at the end of the year when his tax bill came he would only need to pay tax according to his PAYE figure. But it does not work that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 26aaa the Australian Taxation Office simply takes the $30,000 and adds it to his PAYE income, which makes a total of $55,000. The tax on that would be $19,801, using today's rates. We must add $687.50 for Medicare and $16,081 for provisional tax, giving a total of $36,569. If we deduct what he has already paid in PAYE tax, we are left with a net liability of $29,887.50. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, not having any share profits as at 31 March next year-I would say that he would be scared right out of the market, thinking `I will stay on wages for the rest of my life; I am not going to do that any more'-he can then ask for a provisional readjustment and that provisional tax will be wiped off. In other words, his total tax bill, after having wiped out that $16,081, will; be $18,806. That is the bill he will be getting, and he will be getting that bill even though he made no profit on his transactions. One way or another, like it or not, he will have to foot the bill. I know that he has capital losses to wipe off against his capital gains, but a fellow of modest means, on $25,000 year or whatever, with a family, having been scared off after his first time in business or share trading will probably not be game to try anything like that again. He will never, unless he gets a capital gain somewhere by selling one of Grandma's paintings or something like that, get a chance to wipe that capital loss off, so he is left with this $18,806 tax bill to pay. Worse still, he might have borrowed $2,000 to buy those shares in the first place. I stress that he could be a very ordinary wage earner, such as a truck driver, an office worker or whatever you like. It could happen to anyone. As I said he could even have borrowed the money. So, I put that scenario forward as a very simple example of the problems people face, and on about 31 March next year dozens and dozens of these cases will crop up right around Australia. I implore the Government to take this matter on board and see that something is done. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I turn to the subject of mains electricity supply. Since 1980 the cost for extension of electricity supply to farm stations, remote areas, or whatever, used to be able to be written off in the first year of incurring that expense. This has been changed in the May mini-Budget. I find this totally unacceptable because I consider that electricity on a farm, station or whatever is the barest of necessities. Electricity is something that is certainly taken for granted in the cities. Why should country areas put up with less? As I said, that write off provision is to be done away with. I remind the Senate that it is no small cost to connect to the electricity grid supply anywhere in Australia, I presume. I know that one does not have to be very far away from the mains-probably only one kilometre to two kilometres-to have a bill of $7,000; any further away and the cost will soon increase to $15,000, and bills of $20,000 are quite common. Honourable senators should compare that with the city areas that get connected for next to nothing and people expect it for less cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This move is irresponsible and, as I have said, falls only on the people who live in remote areas. They are people, in the main, that this Government does not worry too much about because of the low population density. I remind the Senate that the 9 per cent of the Australian population who live in those areas produce 85 per cent of Australia's export income. One has to remember that once electricity mains are connected, though they may add value to the property, they are not realisable, they are not salable; in other words, they cannot be turned into cash tomorrow and be used as a tax rort. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to fringe benefits tax as applied in remote areas. Here we have the Government finally getting the message of the special needs of remote areas. We told the Minister for Finance time and time again in the old place last year that people in remote areas had a special need. The Government was told how damaging the fringe benefit taxing provisions were to remote areas. It has finally seen some light; that is, that no-one goes into remote areas just because of the fringe benefits-for example, cheap housing. People go out there for the rewards that may come from working on mines or on farms, and so on. If an employer needs to fill a job in a remote area, he has got to supply housing. For that the employer was saddled with 49c in the dollar as the fringe benefit tax, although that was reduced by 0.6 per cent at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully admit that when fringe benefits do not relate to the job, they should be taxed. There is no excuse. Let us consider school fees. If one lives in the city, whatever an employer may care to pay on behalf of his employee should be taxed. But when the benefit is job related, then I maintain that it should not gather any sort of tax. Of course, when we are in government we will address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators such as those who spoke last week and who do not believe that these problems exist in those remote areas should go out into these areas and see the situation for themselves. This Bill addresses some of the injustices but some of the damage is irreparable. When this fringe benefits tax finally hit, many mining towns removed to the city the personnel who were not needed on the site on a continuous basis. They were then flown into and out of the site. That of course led to other problems in relation to the social fabric of those towns. Mostly the towns were left with men without their wives and, on the other side, women were left without their husbands. Eventually these social problems turned to problems for the Department of Social Security. The final injustice is that now many of the mining companies will not build remote area towns. Right from the word go, they will fly the workers, in and out, as happens with the diamond mine and some of the new gold mines. They will build only single men's quarters. As I have already said, this has social implications. In other words, the damage is already done. When we get into government we will do something about this. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the point of the uplifting of the add-on percentage for provisional tax. This Bill seeks to increase that added on figure from 11 per cent to 12 per cent. Eleven per cent was hefty enough even when inflation was running high. But this Government now claims that inflation is down to 7.3 per cent. This is nothing but a further hike to extract money out of the business community and into the Treasury ahead of time to fund its ever increasing social security bill which it has not had the courage to address. I will just give honourable senators inflation figures: In 1983-84 inflation it was at 6.9 per cent; in 1984-85 it was 4.3 per cent; in 1985-86 it was 8.4 per cent; in 1986-87 it was 9.3 per cent; and last year it was 7.3 per cent. In that period the add-on provision has been 11 per cent. Even with that downturn in inflation, the Government has sought to increase it. I know that I will be told that the Government expects business to increase, but it does not always do so. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in the last couple of years they have gone up but before that they were going down. I know that we expect an increase every year in our turnover and, hopefully, our profit, but I think that is going slightly too high. On top of this we also have the quarterly payment system of provisional tax. This has been with us for quite a few years. That money is gradually going into the Treasury quicker and quicker. I maintain that the Government has absolutely no defence for increasing this provisional uplift. The financial impact of this section is an uplift in revenue of $105m in 1989. This is the amount of government grab but honourable senators should remember that this amount is taken out of the future. In other words the Government gets it ahead of time-even ahead of provisional tax. It then spends it and has to find another way of raising more money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ultimate in this Bill must be the latest saga in legislation by press release. This saga is bringing down legislation to cover a press release of three years ago. It has been pointed out by previous speakers what press release is about-it is the taxing of non-cash benefits. In other words, it accrues when one receives a benefit rather than cash. The Government decided to start taxing this from 1985 but it has taken three years to put the legislation into place. I do not understand why it has taken so long. Without having gone too deeply into the matter I believe that there was a certain amount of change along the line. I think that the Treasury was going for the ones who received either cash or kind but then, somewhere along the line, I am pretty sure it was changed. In other words, when a person won a trip to Japan, the people who gave that trip away as an incentive drive or something may have said that the trip could not be cashed. But since 1985 the Government has decided that if it is deemed to have cost a certain amount, tax is payable on it. Perhaps one may not even have taken the trip. I do not know how that would go. I would like to be told. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn briefly to the Taxation Amendment Bill (No. 3). A lot of work has been done on roll-over relief for leases, licences such as fishing licences, taxis, involuntary disposals, and assets transferred on the breakdown of marriage. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may remember how many time honourable senators from this side of the House have spoken on the matter of leases-pastoral or otherwise-which expired, and licences such as fishing licences that expired after September 1985, when the capital gains tax came in. Time and time again it was mentioned. Finally the Government had the good sense to take the advice which, as I said, mostly releated to pastoral leases and fishing licences. I presume taxi licences were included in that. The Government has decided that where there has not been a change of ownership since September 1985, when capital gains tax came in, it will be deemed not to have changed hands and will therefore be free of capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also extended this to the breakdown of marriage. There is a very interesting case from Western Australia where a marriage broke up after 40 years and property was transferred from a trust. This property was not owned by the husband in his own right but went from the trust to the wife. The wife was not really interested-even by paying her husband back-in breaking up the business by demanding money out of it so she agreed to take property from a trust to herself. She did this instead of taking money out of that business which could have probably put the business on the rocks. Unfortunately, her marriage broke up between 20 September 1985 and 20 January or thereabouts of 1988-the date to which the Government said it would backdate these provisions. I understand that any property transferred from joint names or from the husband's name to the wife at any time after 1985 kept the status of non-capital gains. But when the income came from outside, in other words from a trust to the wife, the capital gains were lost. I cannot understand why the Government has not backdated it to 20 September 1985. I have heard of plenty of things used as taxation rorts but I have certainly never heard of a marriage breakup used as a taxation rort. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, I point out the fiasco that must exist in the Department because the Attorney-General has brought in 280 amendments to his corporations package only 12 months or so after it was introduced. That is a sign either that the Government is arrogant and out of touch or that the Department is inefficient. I do not know where to lay the blame, but someone might help me in that regard. It may be an increasing incompetence in the way in which the Government watches how legislation is drafted. I do not know, it is the Government's responsibility. More and more amendments are being moved when a Bill has only just been passed. Unintended consequences are being dealt with by amendments time after time. Some contentious Bills have brought about this situation, mainly those dealing with fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax. Bills of such consequence have not been around for the past 10 or 15 years, and maybe their advent has been the reason for this situation. The Government decided to bring them in, and the Government is certainly responsible for the fiasco that exists there. If this situation continues we will still be sitting at Christmas time. </PARA>
<PARA> I support all the amendments that are to be moved by the coalition, especially those I have pointed out dealing with roll-over relief on the expiration of licences and pastoral leases, mining leases, et cetera.

<PARA> I wish to deal with the question of retrospectivity-or perhaps more correctly, in this case, legislation by media release which the Government has raised, I might say as no compliment, to an art form in the introduction of taxation legislation. Indeed, the practice has more recently infiltrated other areas of legislation introduced by the Labor Government. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1986 and last year's Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill are two which come immediately to mind as having been introduced retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's eleventh and twelfth reports of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills draw the attention of honourable senators to subclause 53 (19) of the No. 4 Bill, which seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to impose certain additional tax upon taxpayers from 20 June 1988. The Standing Committee notes that this was the date upon which a press release announcing the changes, together with a draft Bill, were released by the Treasurer. The Committee goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . consistently argued over a period of several years that legislation made retrospective to the date of a Ministerial announcement is undesirable . . . The Committee note that, in the present case, the alteration to the law will be retrospective to the date of the issue of a media release which also coincided with the release of a draft Bill. The Committee observes that, despite the consultation process which has been followed by the Treasurer in preparing this Bill for submission to Parliament, time will pass (and has passed in the present case) between an announcement and a Bill's introduction.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has quite properly criticised the use by this Government of legislation by media release. Further, it is quite simply no answer to this charge for the Treasurer to respond that a draft Bill outlining the changes has been issued. As all honourable senators will be aware, draft Bills presented are rarely finally introduced into Parliament in their original form. Such Bills are often modified as a result of scrutiny by the Government, by industry, by the Opposition, and ultimately by Parliament. Accordingly the final Bill may have provisions of quite material content which have been substantially altered from the original draft. So it is quite wrong for any government to say that it presented a draft Bill and that gave some clear direction, some clear detail, some clear indication as to the purpose, intent and effect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the recently introduced National Companies and Securities Commission Amendment Bill 1988, in which an enormous number of amendments have been made and upon which if anybody sensibly tried to make judgments as to their commercial arrangements they would have found themselves in grave difficulty. It is absurd that the Government should put that as an argument, and it should be condemned for continuing to use announcements, whatever form they take, as the operative date for often very important and complex legislation; and taxation legislation particularly, which is of fundamental importance to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of some comments I made in this Senate when speaking on the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Bill at the end of May 1986. I was moved to say then:</PARA>
<PARA>After an absolutely disgraceful display we now have before us legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>and I was referring then to the fringe benefits tax measure-</PARA>
<PARA>which will impose a tax which was first announced by the Treasurer on 19 September 1985-some eight months ago. The Treasurer has had eight months to prepare this legislation which is now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will impose a tax which is to apply from 1 July 1986-but seven weeks away. The Treasurer apparently believes that it is reasonable for him to take eight months to prepare this legislation but he then takes the view that taxpayers need only seven weeks to see the legislation before they begin to incur the liability, to be able to understand this complex legislation and to be in a position to pay the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed since then. As I said then, the fringe benefits tax was introduced some eight months after Mr Keating's announcement of September 1985. Of course, the arrogance, disdain and disregard for ordinary citizens in that case pales into insignificance when we compare it with clauses 12 and 13 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). Those clauses propose to introduce a new section 21a into the Income Tax Assessment Act dealing with non-cash business benefits, the definition of which is given in proposed subsection 3. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would think that it is another first for this Government. I think that it is a record for this Government. However, given the mercurial heights to which it is able to ascend, I have no doubt that it will break that record in the near future. Basically, the non-cash business benefit definition means that property or services provided in a business relationship after 4 February 1985 will be taxed. That date, as Senator Messner pointed out, is almost four years ago. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill confirms this at page 14. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The new section will apply to non-cash benefits provided after 4 February 1985 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Immediately following that sentence, as if it is some sort of justification, moral explanation or virtue in nice cute brackets it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>(the date of announcement). </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, that is some sort of vindication. Almost four years after the date of announcement of changes to legislation the Bill to implement those changes was finally introduced into the Parliament. It seems that the Government decided that it needed this provision after the 1980 decision of the Full Federal Court in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Cooke and Sherden. In that case a sales incentive scheme providing non-transferable, non-convertible, overseas trips to soft drink vendors was held to be not subject to tax. On that occasion the court, quite properly within the confines and interpretation of the law at that time, decided that non-cash benefits could be taxable only if they were converted to cash. </PARA>
<PARA> For the moment, I make no judgment as to the wisdom of the legislation itself. However, I pass judgment on the gross unfairness and the high-handedness displayed by this Government in expecting taxpayers to plan their employment and businesses around legislation that will not be introduced for four years. One can ask, reasonably: Is it proper, is it morally acceptable, in today's society that governments can issue, by way of decree, bland pronouncements when, implicit in those pronouncements, as we now know, is the caveat that legislation will not be introduced for four years? Should individual taxpayers be expected to know the full force and effect upon them of such legislation? They are expected to be able to equip themselves, to adapt and, in some way, so arrange their affairs in compliance with legislation to be introduced in four years time, which will carry with it-almost without exception, given this Government-an additional tax liability. How is a taxpayer expected to know the content of a proposed law from some vague ministerial announcement which gives no details except that at some time in the future legislation will be introduced? Surely, during this time the Australian Taxation Office has been duly assessing the tax returns of taxpayers who, notwithstanding the February 1985 announcement, have been receiving non-cash business benefits from their principal suppliers or manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not inquired of the Taxation Office, but I assume that it has been assessing on the law as it stands now and not on some pontificating pronouncement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) as to what he intends in the event that Parliament agrees to his legislative process. I assume that as a result of this legislation, many thousands of tax returns previously assessed in accordance with the prevailing law will have to be re-assessed to take account of the new-found presumptions of cash convertibility to which non-cash business benefits have become subject. </PARA>
<PARA> So one can assume that those who received an annual non-cash benefit as a result of their endeavours will now have to calculate a cashed-out value for that benefit and pay tax on it for four years. Accordingly, those taxpayers who previously paid their taxes quite properly will be subject in the near future to debit assessments for tax which suddenly they find themselves owing. Surely even the Government can see the unfairness of that. I see that Senator Reynolds nods in agreement. Nobody could disagree with that principle. Nobody could argue that there is anything fair about giving somebody, four years later, a tax assessment based on a provision which at the time of the return was not in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Surely Senator McKiernan, as a man of fairness, would have stood up in the Caucus and objected to that. We ask of the Australian people that they pay their share of taxation but, prior to this Government, there used to be fundamental principles in taxation law in this country-that is, the principles of fairness, equity and clarity. The average taxpayer, the average John Citizen in the community, should be able reasonably to understand what his liability is. We now have a government with capricious disregard for taxpayers. It is hell-bent in its pursuit of collecting every cent of tax it can, in whatever way it can, totally ignoring decency and fairness which it cries for itself when it introduces diabolical taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many taxpayers may not even have been aware that the non-cash business benefits they were receiving for work performed over the last four years were eventually to become subject to income tax. This is because in many cases ministerial announcements do not seep through to such people. I would think that the average car salesman who has won a trip to Hawaii because he sold more cars than anybody else in the neighbourhood, Western Australia or wherever, would be hardly likely to scan the financial pages every day to see whether there is some new pro- nouncement by the Treasurer of which he ought to be aware and conscious and to take that into consideration when he sits down to do his taxation return. I hardly imagine that such people read business digests so they can be quite certain that nothing is going to come along, unsuspecting as they are, and knock them over four years later. I am sure that those people do not set aside contingency amounts in the event that the Treasurer will retrospectively introduce new legislation four years later. Yet this Government expects taxpayers to show enthusiasm for its tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I would go further and suggest that it is not unreasonable to expect that those taxpayers who were aware of the proposed changes might have imagined and perhaps quite reasonably concluded, after the expiration of four years, when there is no statute on the books and they have not heard from their corner accountant that they are likely to owe tax at a new level, that this was one of these statements or promises from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which has diminished and disappeared in the mirage of confused politics and that the Government has not proceeded with its proposal. It is these sorts of actions and this sort of conduct by the Hawke Government which has made a mockery of both the parliamentary process and the rule of law itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has similarly been concerned over the last five or so years-it is interesting that it has been concerned for so long-about what has been seen as the practice of the Australian Taxation Office of resorting to legislation by media release as a matter of course when making changes to the taxation laws. The Committee commented extensively on this question of retrospective legislation in its 1986-87 annual report. The Committee considered that except in one or perhaps two very restricted circumstances, legislation by media release should not be used by the Government when enacting laws. At page 12 of the report the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the practice of `legislation by press release' carries with it the assumption that citizens should arrange their affairs in accordance with announcements made by the Executive rather than in accordance with the laws. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is almost as if Mr Keating thinks he is a pope and he is making some ex cathedra statement that suddenly becomes law. The Committee went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It treats the passage of the necessary retrospective legislation `ratifying' the announcement as a pure formality. It places the Parliament in the invidious position of either agreeing to the legislation without significant amendment or bearing the odium of overturning the arrangements which many people may have made in reliance on the ministerial announcement. Moreover, quite apart from the debilitating effect of the practice of the Parliament, it leaves the law in a state of uncertainty. Persons such as lawyers and accountants who must advise their clients on the law are compelled to study the terms of the press release in an attempt to ascertain what the law is. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that a reasonable way of doing business? Is that the way one would buy a motor car, a house or a refrigerator? Of course it is not. This Government puts itself above the law when it deals with other people's taxation. As the Committee quite properly notes, the legislation may differ significantly from the terms of the announcement, or the Senate may refuse to pass the legislation. In respect of the latter, I can only imagine some cute scenario in the future where the Australian Democrats, by dint of some rare aberration, agree with the Opposition and choose to amend or reject legislation. It is also the case that on almost all occasions where the Government adopts the modus operandi of government by media release, that the retrospectivity acts in favour of the Government and to the detriment of the taxpayer. On my calculations, over the last 5 1/2 years the Government, particularly in respect of tax legislation, has introduced respective legislation on at least 17 occasions that I am aware of. I have no doubt that on a more diligent examination, somebody could find other occasions. These Bills comprise the major pieces of taxation legislation introduced by the Government, such as the bottom of the harbour legislation, the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and dividend imputation legislation, which retrospectively denied the inter-corporate dividend rebate in certain circumstances. But they are all fundamental pieces of legislation which have significantly changed the individual's taxation responsibilities. On all but two of those 17 occasions, of which I am aware, the legislation has operated exclusively for the pecuniary benefit of the Government. On the other two occasions where there was some retrospective benefit for the community, it also operated in favour of the Government. For the record, they were the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1983 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1983. Of course, this reinforces the public perception of the Hawke Government running a record revenue raising operation, a government which enacts retrospective legislation to squeeze as much money out of predominantly middle class Australia as it possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard honourable senators may have received correspondence from constituents concerning clause 46 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988. This clause will extend the roll-over relief from the capital gains tax to assets transferred by a company or a trust pursuant to a Family Court order or a maintenance agreement. Previously, such relief applied only to the direct transfer of assets between spouses. Consequently, since 20 September 1985, the indirect transfer of assets to a beneficial spouse has been subject to a capital gains tax upon sale. The constituents who have contacted me have requested that action be taken to have this provision backdated so as to operate from 20 September 1985-not, I would have thought, an unreasonable proposition. Obviously these constituents perceive discrimination. The Government will introduce retrospective legislation to raise revenue, but, of course, it will refrain from backdating legislation where it means a benefit to taxpayers and some cost, however modest it might be, to revenue. In the instant case there is perhaps a valid reason why clause 46 is not backdated. In the cases before the Family Court between September 1985 and 20 January 1988, it is to be hoped that in determining what is fair and equitable in terms of a settlement between the parties, the courts took into account that the transferee of this class of assets would be subject to a future capital gains tax liability, and that would have been accommodated in terms of the court's deliberations. Nonetheless, I suggest that the public perception of this Government is quite properly one of an unfair revenue raiser, and that perception is well justified. </PARA>
<PARA> I have commented many times in this place on the record tax grab perpetrated by this Government on the Australian taxpayer and, further, that this Government undertakes legislation by media release as a matter of administrative course. In most cases there have been no extenuating circumstances. Revenue would not have been lost if such a course had not been taken. It is simply a matter of norm and form for this Government now to conduct itself the way it does. I would suggest that the unfairness of this Government is no more starkly shown than in the length of time it has taken to cure the anomaly contained in section 26aaa. Honourable senators would be aware that this section provides that short term sales, that is, within 12 months, of assets other than trading stock, are to be included in assessable income. Of course, this includes the sale of property being the principal place of residence for a taxpayer unless, for example, the sale was caused by the taxpayer changing employment. Despite the advent of the capital gains tax legislation since September 1985, for some reason, known only to this Government, section 26aaa has continued to apply for the short term sales of a taxpayer's home. Finally, it was announced in conjunction with this year's May economic statement that section 26aaa would no longer apply to the sale of property or an interest in property occurring after 25 May 1988. Accordingly, any sale within 12 months is now to be subject to the capital gains tax rules. Under the capital gains tax, of course, an exemption exists for a sale of a taxpayer's principal place of residence. Taxpayers are entitled, however, to ask why it has taken so long to correct this anomaly. Why has this Government been so slow?</PARA>
<PARA> A purchaser of a home to be used as the principal place of residence may, for any number of reasons, need to sell that dwelling prior to the expiration of 12 months. Yet if the taxpayer does so, he is immediately put to disadvantage compared to the person who is able to hold a residence for more than 12 months. A change in family circumstances, financial hardship or even dissatisfaction with the purchase may necessitate a sale of the home within the 12-month period. Owing to the unwarranted effects of section 26aaa, however, the taxpayer has been unable to do so without facing the penalty of taxation. It has taken this Government three years to rectify that fault. It is interesting how with a wave of the wand and by the issue of a press statement this Government can find a way of closing what it perceives to be tax loopholes, but when it comes to correcting a wrong, an anomaly, a difficulty or disadvantage to a taxpayer it takes the Government a great deal of time to act. I suspect that is a result of the priorities of this Government and the agenda it has set for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> On a final note, I refer to a matter upon which I have previously touched in this place. It concerns the effect of inflation and its taxation implications for the depreciation of plant and equipment. I interpose that the underlying problem of Australia's economy is the distortion in terms of capital investment and savings compared with consumption. If one looks at the levels of consumption in Australia compared with the rest of the Western world, at the levels of capital investment and capital savings compared with countries such as Japan and Korea, one can see why we are at such a significant disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) will terminate the general accelerated depreciation provisions which have previously allowed plant to be written off over five or three years. The problem arises when the company accounts for the depreciation allowances in its books. Under the current accounting practice companies are required to record assets in their books at the prices for which they were purchased-hence the term historic cost. A deduction is allowed for depreciation of the asset so that, in theory, by the time the asset has come to the end of its usable life the company will have been able to put away sufficient funds to maintain the intitial value of the capital intact. Of course, anything earned by the company after deduction of expenses and depreciation is a profit and quite rightly taxable. The effect of inflation, however, is completely ignored so that at the end of the depreciation period-say, 10 years-it may cost the company an extra 60 per cent to purchase the same piece of equipment. Accordingly, with no allowance for inflation, the actual profit received by the company is far less than that which is shown. Indeed, a loss may in fact be made. I see that my time has run out in this debate, but I want to conclude by saying that the great tragedy for this country, for the community and for individuals is this Government's total lack of regard for taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few remaining minutes of debate tonight on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), I shall commence my contribution on these further taxation amendment Bills which have been introduced by the Government. We are debating these Bills during a period of massive tax increases. Thus, the first Opposition amendment is in terms that the Senate notes that</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . this is the highest taxing government in the post-war history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We are further debating these Bills in an environment of increased inequality and increased injustice within our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was a student of taxation law it used to be said that a good tax system could be tested against whether it is simple, equitable and efficient. No-one would say that our taxation system in this country is simple, it having had literally thousands of pages of additional tax law added since the Hawke Government came to power. The test of whether it is equitable-in other words, whether those who can afford to pay more do and those who can afford to pay less pay less-has similarly fallen down, as I shall demonstrate in a moment or two. The third question as to whether the system is efficient, whether one is not disadvantaged by the type of tax entity one becomes, has also, I regret, failed the test. I intend to look at a few of these tax facts of life into which these Bills are to be set. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that since 1980-81 tax paid by Australian people has more than doubled. In 1981 it was just over $40 billion; in 1987-88 it was $92 billion-a massive increase going far beyond inflation. The personal tax rate in some instances is now higher than the corporate rate. That in itself introduces distortions, with inducements to taxpayers to alter their taxation vehicle to attain the advantages that are provided to it by government in that form. The gap between average weekly earnings and the highest marginal rate of tax is ever decreasing. In other words, more average weekly earners are paying the highest marginal rates of tax. The number of taxpayers in the 40 per cent income tax bracket is now over 2.9 million. In other words, 40.6 per cent of Australians in the pay as you earn category are now into that 40 per cent income tax bracket. Income tax as a percentage of average weekly earnings has increased from 17.6 per cent in February 1983 to 21 per cent in February 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> I put this matter to the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, on the day before the Budget. I asked him whether he was aware of the fact that when his Government came to power the taxpayer on average weekly earnings was paying 17.6 per cent in tax and is now paying 21 per cent, an increase of 3.4 per cent. The Minister was not prepared to answer that question, so presumably he was unaware. I asked the Minister whether he was also aware that a taxpayer on five times average weekly earnings was paying 48.5 per cent and is now paying 43.7 per cent, a drop of 4.8 per cent. In other words, a taxpayer on high earnings is now paying a lesser percentage of his income in taxation. Again, the Minister was not prepared to answer that question. Since the Hawke Government came to power those who are not as well off are paying more tax, whereas those who are better off in the community, the well off in the community, are paying less tax. That is a matter of which the community should be aware. </PARA>
<PARA> A further setting in which we must put these taxation Bills, and which is related to the matters I have just mentioned, is the incredible effect of bracket creep on taxation revenue. It is now said by accountants and economists that each year there is now about $8 billion extra in revenue as a result simply of bracket creep-individuals' taxation rates moving into higher brackets purely through the effects of inflation. This was put vividly to the Australian people in a series of articles written by the well known financial journalist Terry McCrann and published in the Melbourne Herald. Those articles commenced on 17 October this year, a very short time ago. Terry McCrann clearly brought to the attention of the Australian people how they were suffering at the expense of this Government's policy of allowing bracket creep more and more to affect what is left over after the payment of tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, is certainly an enthusiast for tax reform, and as a professional he carries out his duties with vigour, integrity and enthusiasm. However, it is a role of an opposition to point out areas where the Australian Taxation Office should heed community and practitioners' concerns in applying the administration of taxation law. In the process of reviewing the Office, I for one, who frequently speak on tax issues, rely on articles in business and professional journals as well as comments from informed registered tax agents. One such article, in Australian Business of 28 June 1988, on page 19, appeared to me to attribute to one of Mr Boucher's deputy commissioners, Mr Conwell, the words, `The Australian Taxation Office is keen to determine just how far full and free access can be taken'. These words stunned a number of people and I have used them on several occasions in this chamber and in Senate Estimate committee hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This testing of the extent of full and free access has support from another area-in fact, from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in paragraph 3.21 of its taxation rulings of November 1987, in which it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also recognises, as was noted earlier, that the Commissioner is entitled to test the law where he regards it as in doubt, where the Commissioner considers that this is desirable in order to protect the revenue. Arguably, the Commissioner has a duty to do so. Rulings which some taxpayers regard as ill-founded may represent no more than a signalling by the Commissioner of his intention to assert, on doubtful points, the view that best protects the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>I was wrong in attributing that quotation to Deputy Commissioner Conwell, and for the record I report on Mr Boucher's response to Estimates Committee C, as recorded on page C167 of Hansard. I asked for the reason behind the statement, `The Australian Taxation Office is keen to determine just how full and free access can be taken'. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>The question is understood to relate to an article appearing on page 19 of the Australian Business magazine of 28 June 1988. A reading of that article reveals that the quotation is not in fact attributable to the ATO's Mr Conwell (Deputy Commissioner, Melbourne), but is an assertion of the journalists themselves. Mr Conwell wishes to advise that he has never held the view asserted by the journalists, and accordingly could not have been the source of that portion of the article. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that was the source that I took my comment from. It appears to be an error, and I apologise to Mr Boucher and his Deputy Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me at the outset apologise to the Government for not letting it know that I was going to speak on the adjournment. It was not my intention to do so earlier. The matter that I want to raise, with the indulgence of the Senate, relates to the Olympic Games that have just passed. I chose not to say anything at the time not because it was not material but out of taste. I want to touch on the matter of Zola Budd, and at least to record what happened to her as distinct from other athletes from around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 20 June 1987, Zola Budd, a British citizen with a British passport, returned to her birthplace of South Africa. During her period in that country she visited a cross-country course Brakpan, a small South African mining town in the Transvaal. In the course of that cross-country race, Zola Budd, in a tracksuit and wearing joggers, trotted not on but across the course, not in the race but alongside competing athletes to give them some encouragement and heart. That conduct was followed by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) Board ordering the British Amateur Athletic Board to suspend her. Lawyers for the British Amateur Athletic Board advised the Board that if Miss Budd took the Board to court the case would be overturned, she would be reinstated and there would be very considerable costs to the Board. However, as a result of black African pressure and threats of other English athletes being precluded from the world cross-country championships in New Zealand later that year, Zola Budd generously withdrew to ensure that in no way would those athletes be prejudiced. I might say that the New Zealand Government's conduct was absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> When the International Amateur Athletic Federation met in mid-April this year, 11 members favoured Budd's suspension and only Britain, the United States of America and Germany opposed it. The proposal was that she be suspended for 12 months. The effect of that would have been to preclude her from the world cross-country championships in New Zealand and also from the Seoul Olympics. The hypocrisy of this debate is to be demonstrated by Australia's different standards. The South Australian Labor Government, for example, with the warm and smiling approval of the Federal Government, embraced all the drivers competing in the world formula one motor racing grand prix fresh from their circuits in South Africa, welcoming them to Adelaide. There was no suggestion that any of those drivers would be banned or criticised or condemned; they were welcomed into Adelaide. Alan Jones came to Adelaide for his first race as a national hero, fresh from victories in South Africa. There was no criticism of Alan Jones or of any of the other drivers. </PARA>
<PARA> When Pat Cash required some points to get himself up the scale to compete in the grand prix tennis tournament he went to South Africa to compete. All he needed was a few points. He was not there for the glory or for the money; he simply needed the grand prix points to get himself into the championships, the final, the big stakes. What was said and what was done? Bob Hawke said of his mate-he loves to call all these winners `mate'-that he was disappointed with him. What has been said of Greg Norman? What has been said of any other Australian athlete who has gone to South Africa? Absolutely nothing. Zola Budd's sin, of course, is that she is white and she was born in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the hypocrisy which pervades sport administration overseas. One of the prime movers to have Zola Budd banned from athletics was a Dr Primo Nebiolo, the 64-year-old President of both the International Amateur Athletic Federation and the Italian Athletics Federation. Dr Nebiolo aspires to be elected to the International Olympic Committee. He understands that that takes the black vote. We hear much rage and indignation from Dr Nebiolo about Zola Budd, yet at home in the Rome world championships there was a conspiracy by Italian officials, who abused their privileged positions of adjudication. It resulted in cheating. This cheating obtained a medal for Giovanni Evangelista with a fictitious registered jump. I believe that there is no greater sin in sport than to cheat, except to be an official who allows the cheating. An official is given the trust of all the competitors and all the other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> While the IAAF, of which Dr Nebiolo is President, found nothing untoward in its investigation of the incident, it finally led to the resignation of the Italian federation secretary, Mr Barra. Not a word was said when the same Mr Barra, in his role as assistant to the International Amateur Athletic Federation, took his seat in the council meeting in London to discuss the Budd disqualification. I would have thought that by any measure Mr Barra and Dr Nebiolo should have resigned. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I ought to conclude on Dr Nebiolo by recalling that in 1973, in the European Cup semi-final in Oslo, Britain displaced Italy for a place. On that day the start of the 800 metres was held up for over an hour when Italian officials and athletes angrily invaded the track following the disqualification of their runner for two false starts. After what has been described in the media as undignified scuffles, Mr Barra and others were led by police from the track. Later in the day Dr Nebiolo was scheduled to make a medal presentation. However, still sulking and still enraged by the disqualification of an athlete for two false starts, he refused to present the medal. The Italian athletes boycotted the official banquet that evening. </PARA>
<PARA> We might ask ourselves: who was the Italian athlete about whom there was such an uproar? It was Mr Marcello Fiasconaro. It was his European 400 metres silver medal which he won in August 1971 that brought tears of joy to Dr Nebiolo, even though he had never set foot in Italy earlier than a month prior to the race. In fact, he could not speak a word of Italian. That was natural enough because he was born, grew up, trained, was coached and still lived in South Africa. Zola Budd's sin is that she was born white and she was born in South Africa. Non-whites from South Africa are able to compete overseas, where whites are not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that those of us who take an interest in sport would know of Sydney Maree, the coloured South African who is now a United States citizen, who frequently visits South Africa, has coaching clinics in South Africa, presents trophies in South Africa, receives trophies in South Africa and who, by definition of the charge laid against Zola Budd, participates in South Africa. Yet there has not been a word of criticism; not a moment of utterance. As one journalist put it, `Zola Budd has been psychologically necklaced for being a 17-year-old spindly little girl who was born in the Transvaal and not somewhere else'. The ignominious indifference, sacrificing the innocent to satisfy the guilty, is an expedient that has fluttered fitfully throughout human history and has now been elevated, as one journalist said recently, `to an art form'. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask: what has this girl done to deserve what she got? How has she sinned more than those athletes from Romania, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Nicaragua? One could go through all the left wing, undemocratic dictatorships. We see no objection, for instance, to those beautiful little gymnasts from Bulgaria, Romania or the Soviet Union who display their ability and their talents at the Olympic Games. Yet, if we see the way that there is discrimination in those countries-some of it has been raised in the last day or two by Senator Baden Teague-and we see what has happened in Afghanistan, we then ask: what is the moral incompatibility which allows us to discriminate against one athlete and not others? It seems to me that black Africans have had enormous influence. Yet if we go through the list of black African countries that participate in the Olympic Games we find that there are very few which are democracies. </PARA>
<PARA> This poor little girl has been hounded out of the love of her life, not because she has broken any rules, not because of her political views, not for her sins, not that in any way she is responsible for any misconduct, the breaking of rules or whatever. She has been penalised, discriminated against and driven out of her sport, which has cost enormous amounts of money, simply because she is a white South African. She has now retired and gone back to live in South Africa, I understand. If one looked at her recent performances one would see how her times started to extend and her competitive spirit was obviously snuffed out. We as a Parliament and we as a country did not stand by her; we supported that conduct and allowed it to happen. I think that is an indictment upon all of us. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) It would not be possible to provide an accurate response to this question without examining each establishment variation in detail. The number would, however, be very small as it is Departmental practice to reclassify positions under section 29a of the Public Service Act rather than create and abolish positions with similar functions.</PARA>
<PARA> There were 62 positions reclassified to a higher level during 1987-88. Each reclassification was in accordance with the strict tests set down for reclassification including adherence to National Wage Case Principles.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="2169" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 October (Hansard, page 1649), Senator Puplick asked me as Minister representing the Prime Minister a question without notice about a Bicentennial exhibition of Macedonian antiquities. I undertook to obtain answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has supplied the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 Greek authorities offered an exhibition of antiquities, including some treasures from the tombs of King Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, to Australia as a Bicentennial gesture.</PARA>
<PARA> The offer was welcomed by Australian authorities both because it reflected the importance the Government of Greece attached to Greek-Australian relations, a view reciprocated by the Australian Government, and because the exhibition itself was seen as culturally significant.</PARA>
<PARA> There was never at any time an attempt to ``derail'' the exhibition. Indeed the exhibition has been warmly welcomed by the Government. Nor did the Government insist that the term Macedonia not be used in connection with the exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with a Government decision taken in 1986 about bicentennial projects proposed by other Governments and having significance for bi-lateral relations, my Department on my instructions asked the Bicentennial Authority on 10 October to provide funds to support the exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority's Chairman, Mr Kirk, immediately agreed to provide $950,000, exercising his authority to commit up to $1m without consulting his board.</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that Australians generally will welcome this magnificent exhibition as a generous gesture from the Government of Greece and am surprised that the Opposition is now apparently opposed to it.</PARA>
<PARA> The funds contributed by the Authority will not be taken away from the proposed Bicentennial Youth Foundation, details of and funding for which have yet to be settled.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Australian Bicentennial Authority that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra applied on 2 September 1986 for funding for its tour of North America. The Authority's decision not to fund the Orchestra was taken in the normal way after considering other, competing, requests. The Orchestra was advised of the Authority's decision on 15 October 1986. The Government was not involved in that decision.</PARA>
