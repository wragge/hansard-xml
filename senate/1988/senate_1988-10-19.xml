<PARA> The gold mining industry is a vibrant expanding industry which provides employment for many Australians;</PARA>
<PARA> The gold mining industry provides valuable export income which contributes to a stronger balance of trade and Australian dollar, and thus a higher standard of living for all Australians;</PARA>

<TITLE>National Identification Numbering System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The adoption of the upgraded Tax-File Number proposal, to compel every person to quote the number for many ordinary business dealings, would be an intrusion on the traditional liberty we have enjoyed under the Common Law and the Parliamentary Federation in our Constitutional Monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) The databanks and surveillance methods that would increase under this proposal would tend to provide a constant unwarranted threat to the privacy of citizens, residents, and perhaps visitors and tourists.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) There are other parallel threats to our privacy and liberties, such as the move to give police in Australia and overseas access to our Income Tax File details, and to provide computer-based information to an international bureau in Brussels, plus the proposal that State police be empowered to listen in to private telephone conversations.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners pray that the Government withdraw any bill, or repeal any Act, to establish the Tax-File Number proposal, and that Members of Parliament, without regard for party, unanimously reject any such moves as being contrary to our personal liberties, our privacy, and the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that in future the Federal Government discharges its responsibilities in relation to visits by foreign warships. As senators will by now be fully aware, last weekend, on the occasion of the Bicentennial Naval Salute in Melbourne, the Seamen's Union of Australia, endorsed by the Trades Hall Council, adopted a resolution to ban tugs from assisting United States and British ships because of the believed nuclear capacity of the ships. As a result of such action, the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal and its supply ship Fort Grange were prevented from berthing in Melbourne, whilst the USS Ingersoll, having docked under its own steam, was unable to leave Melbourne without assistance because of bad weather. All of this and not a word of apology from the Victorian State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the Federal Government needs to be reminded of just how important the visits to Australian ports by foreign warships are to Australia's international relations, and of the obvious and vital implications such visits have for our national defence and security. Apparently the Government also needs to be reminded that it is their responsibility, not the states', to maintain Australia's defence and international arrangements. For not only did the events of last weekend reveal the Government's weakness in kow-towing to the extremist Victorian unions. After all, weakness is nothing new for this Government. More importantly, the whole episode revealed a dangerous willingness on the part of the Government to sacrifice the defence and security of all Australians in favour of the dictates of an extremist minority. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is, after all, an island, and the sea is therefore one of our first lines of defence. And when we consider the current political and military instability of our closer neighbours-Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia for example, as well as our own limited naval capability to defend our shores and sea lanes, such treatment as our Western Allies received last weekend is nothing short of irresponsible. The friendship and military support of our Western Allies is a vital necessity for the defence of this nation. To try that friendship is to tamper with Australia's defence. Such an episode must never happen again. To this end, in addition to reminding the Government of its responsibilities and powers in the area of visiting foreign warships, the Bill will make provision in formal terms for the authorising, on behalf of Australia, of entry to our waters by foreign warships where such entry is desired, and it will provide a legal framework for appropriate action to be taken to safeguard approved visits from obstruction and interference. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the policy of foreign governments to `neither confirm nor deny' the carriage of nuclear arms aboard their warships, surely the Government recognizes a necessity for these countries to safeguard against the disclosure of valuable information to potential enemies about the military capabilities of the particular ship, and of the country itself? Against this background I turn to the terms of the Bill. As I have already mentioned, the Bill includes an objects clause stating that it is intended to establish procedures for the discharge by the Commonwealth of its constitutional responsibilities and powers. The clause also declares the intention that in furthering the object of the Act the cooperation and assistance of the States and their authorities be sought and utilised, so far as it is appropriate and practicable to do so, in facilitating access to Australian ports for warships visiting Australia. However, the Bill is expressed to operate to the exclusion of any State or Territory laws that would prevent or obstruct any act or thing that a warship or person is empowered or permitted to do by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the operation of the legislation is the power given to the Minister for Defence to grant approval for a specified foreign warship, or class of foreign warships, to have access during a specified period to Australian ports or to specified Australian ports. Such an approval may be made subject to conditions. It is envisaged that, in practice, all such approvals will be subject to compliance with conditions relating to navigation and safety, health, quarantine, customs and immigration requirements. Provision is also made for the Minister to give directions to the commander of a foreign warship in respect of which an approval is in force. Directions may be given about the movement of the ship or its crew or about the loading or unloading of goods. Directions of this nature would essentially be supplementary to the conditions attached to an approval, and could be necessitated by circumstances arising after an approval is given. Where an approval is in force, a foreign warship covered by the approval will be entitled to enter, remain in and depart from an Australian port covered by the approval. In addition, goods may be loaded onto or unloaded from the ship and services may be supplied to the ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 9 of the Bill, the Minister for Defence is empowered to give directions to facilitate access by a foreign warship to an Australian port, where a relevant approval is in force. These powers would be exercised only as a last resort where access by a foreign warship was being frustrated or significantly hindered by a refusal or failure to provide the goods, services or facilities normally required for that purpose. These might include the provision of pilotage or tug services, the availability or berthing facilities, or the supply of services such as water or electricity. Clause 9 provides that a direction may be given only where the Minister is satisified that giving the direction is necessary to secure the entry, stay or departure of the ship, or the safety of the ship, its crew or other persons, or is necessary or convenient for the effective operation of the ship. Provision is made for the compensation for loss or damage sustained as a result of compliance with a direction. Provision is also made for payment for the provision of goods, services or facilities, or other things, pursuant to a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will establish offences of preventing, hindering or obstructing the entry of a ship to, the berthing of a ship at, or the departure of a ship from, an Australian port in respect of which a relevant approval is in force. Other offences are provided relating to failure to comply with a direction by the Minister for Defence under clause 9, and of preventing, hindering or obstructing other specified activities relating to a ship. As I have already said, the Opposition believes that visits to Australian ports by the warships of our friends and allies have the overwhelming support of the Australian people. The Opposition is also confident that this legislation, prompted by threat to the continuance of such visits, will have similar support. Even now, these visiting warships, here at the invitation of the Federal Government to help us celebrate our Bicentenary, are waiting to visit further Australian ports. The Government is lacking the leadership and the determination to enable these visits to take place. It is urgent that this legislation be considered by this Parliament. I therefore commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX ASSESSMENT (No. 1) AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the sale value provisions of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) so that where a manufacturer sells goods only by retail, after 8 p.m. on Tuesday 23 August 1988 the sale value for tax purposes will be based on the manufacturer's own costs and profit. At present, where a manufacturer sells goods only by retail the sale value is based on the price charged by another manufacturer selling identical goods by wholesale. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has announced, as part of the 1988-89 Budget, a number of changes to the scope of the present wholesale sales tax system. This Bill, and one other I will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to those changes. The changes will, with one exception, come into effect after 8 p.m. on Tuesday 23 August 1988. The exception is the announcement concerning the imposition of sales tax on beer, which will come into effect on 24 August 1988. Given the comments already made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech and the details contained in Statement No. 4 of Budget Paper No. 1 and the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable senators, I will do no more than outline briefly the changes proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, as part of the announced reforms to the beer excise, currently exempt beer with an alcohol content of more than 1.15 per cent by volume is to be taxed at the rate of 20 per cent. Secondly, the Bill will correct as follows a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the various schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. All plastic envelopes, courier type bags and all goods used by retailers to wrap or secure goods for marketing or delivery, which are currently exempt from tax, will become taxable at the rate of 20 per cent. The tax payable on wrapping materials marketed for household use will increase from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The following exempt goods will become taxable at the 10 per cent rate. All containers, spoons, serviettes and accessories used by retailers in marketing take-away foodstuffs; mixes marketed for use in the manufacture of thick shakes and ice cream; and museli bars and other health food bars. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of tax on toiletries, perfumes and cosmetics, and on photographs and photographic materials, will be reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. All aircraft except gliders are to be exempt from tax. Food for fish and crustaceans farmed for commercial purposes, which is currently taxable at the 20 per cent rate, is to be exempt from tax. Soy milk which is currently taxable at the 20 per cent rate is to be exempt if it does not contain flavouring, and taxable at the 10 per cent rate if flavoured. Finally, the Bill will confirm the scope of the law in relation to the taxation of flavoured milk drinks and bathroom fittings and sanitary ware. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday of this week we were debating whether there should be a cognate debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and the Australian Democrats' notice of motion for the establishment of a Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. Mr President, if I may, I will give a brief resume of where we got to at the time. This Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 seeks to introduce uniform registrations in the use and registration of veterinary and agricultural chemicals throughout Australia. A motion was moved by the Australian Democrats to debate the Bill cognately with a notice of motion for the establishment of an inquiry into the use of all agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Mr President, I believe that if two Bills or, in this case, a Bill and a notice of motion are to be debated cognately, they should have a certain amount of common purpose. I do believe, and I certainly maintain, that there is not very much common purpose about these two questions that are before honourable senators at present. If they are not in total unison, at least they should have something in common. I can find nothing they have in common. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should give a brief resume of the objects of the Bill. The objectives of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill are to protect and enhance trade and commerce in agricultural produce and livestock; to assist in the conduct of agricultural and veterinary operations in all or any of the States or Territories; to minimise any undue hazard-this is the important one-to the public, the environment, users and agricultural produce and livestock from the application of chemical products in accordance with recommendations for their use; to minimise the need for separate evaluation of chemical products by registering authorities of States and Territories; to ensure that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are effective in respect of the use for which they are cleared; and, lastly, the Bill seeks to ensure that evaluation of chemical products is carried out in a timely and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> But when one looks at the objectives of the Democrats' motion, it will be found that they are poles apart from those of the Bill. They are not only poles apart; they are vin- dictive. I will also briefly summarise point by point what the objectives of the proposed Committee are as set out in the notice of motion given by the Democrats:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the adequacy of arrangements under the legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and coordination system for agricultural and veterinary chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you, Mr President, that with the speedy passage of the main Bill itself, there is no need to carry out an immediate inquiry. That inquiry will not be so immediate either because it is stated in the terms of reference that a final report be brought out by the last sitting day of 1989 which is a long way down the track. It is also stated that a report is required by the first sitting day of 1989, which means, on that score, that the Select Committee would not have been in action. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a big inquiry by the Australian Agricultural Council on the need for such legislation. That has been done and has certainly been reflected in the legislation in front of honourable senators at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second of the Democrats' objectives, which is the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems. This is exactly where we see the ideology of the Australian Democrats coming through in their notice of motion. The other night I called this a witch-hunt. Having read their objectives properly and seeing some of their intended amendments to the Bill, I am more strongly convinced that this is nothing but a witch-hunt when compared with the solid basis of the legislation at hand. I spoke to one of the Australian Democrats last week about a special type of wheat which they want Australian wheat growers to produce without using any chemicals. That might be viable if one could get about $800 per tonne for it. Once again their ideology comes through on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' last point is the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. That is nothing but a doubling up because, as I informed the Senate the other night, the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) is about to lodge the report of its inquiry into this matter. That report is due by the end of the year and, as I said previously, it will be the result of experts looking properly and objectively into the problems that may or may not arise from the need for and the use of these chemicals in Australia. That report is being put together by Australia's most eminent agricultural scientists and there is no way in the world that we need another wide-ranging inquiry before we see the results of that one. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the ASTEC report been with us and in the unlikely event that it had not addressed the problem or the issue, I could have excused this call for another inquiry. But we are attempting here to set up another inquiry immediately without waiting for ASTEC's findings. On the other hand, the legislation before us is very definite and it could be made operative as soon as it passes through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The other evening and again this morning I described the Democrats' proposal as `a vindictive witch-hunt' compared with the legislation's intentions. I will give just one example of how I think it is a vindictive witch-hunt. I just happened to cast my eyes over the Democrats' proposed amendments to the Bill. Had they had any nous, they would have left them, together with their proposal for an inquiry, in their hidden agenda. The Democrats have told us that they intend to move certain amendments to clause 20 of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. The Bill proposes a penalty of $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both, for a person who releases confidential information-in other words, patent information or anything concerning a manufacturer. As I said--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The matter of an amendment to one of the Bills is hardly relevant to whether the two matters should be debated cognately, which is what we should be discussing now.

Significantly different issues are raised by the notice of motion and the legislation. Senator Panizza is pointing out the differences which exist between the two and why, therefore, a cognate debate would not be helpful. With greatest respect to the point of order which has been raised, in my view Senator Panizza should be allowed to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I shall continue. There is a clause in the Bill which is designed to prevent disclosure of confidential and commercial information. The Democrats seek to cut the term of imprisonment for that offence from 12 months to one month, thereby allowing, under the ruse of the Senate select committee, a few spies, perhaps, to get information and not pay the penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A penalty also applies for letting out further information. I will not go into it too deeply, except to say that the Democrats again seek to reduce the term of imprisonment from 12 months to one month. Where a chemical company is involved, or people dealing in chemicals, the Democrats turn completely about, which shows their ideology. They wish to treat these people differently from the fellow who is giving out commercial information. For the person who does not give demanded information to the council regarding his chemicals, whereas the Bill provides for a penalty of $10,000 or imprisonment for five years or both, the Democrats seek to increase the fine to $100,000 and, in the case of a body corporate, from $50,000 to $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of certain certificates not being complied with, the Bill provides for a $5,000 penalty which the Democrats want increased to $40,000 and, in the case of a body corporate, from $25,000 to $200,000. So the true feelings and objectives of the Democrats are coming out. The Bill also provides for a penalty for the provision of false information by a company or persons. The Democrats seek to increase that penalty as it applies to a person from $10,000 to $100,000 and, in the case of a body corporate, from $50,000 to $500,000. So much for the Democrats' intentions! The Democrats seek to get the penalty down to a month's imprisonment for anyone who goes along with their line of thinking but they wish to make anyone else pay dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time draws to an end I would like to theorise for a moment on why the Government is backing this notice of motion. As I said the other night, there is at least one person on the Government benches who is familiar with agriculture and the use of agricultural chemicals. Is the Government letting this notice of motion go through with an agricultural chemicals Bill that we really need, using as an excuse the fact that it is important legislation and that the Democrats would give it their support only if the Government allowed them to institute this wide-ranging witch-hunt? As I said the other night, we will certainly be opposing the Democrats' notice of motion, but we will be supporting the legislation before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, for your ruling a few moments ago when I sought to take a point of order on Senator Panizza. He sought to raise the matter of the amendments which I have foreshadowed to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988. I remind the Opposition that when I moved precisely the same amendments to the Bill, which is now an Act, which created the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority and for precisely the same misdemeanours-namely, the revelation of information which had been provided in that case on the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority and in this case on the foreshadowed council which will establish the mechanisms for registering and regulating pesticides-the Opposition supported them. Those penalties are now written into law. Not only did the Opposition support the amendments but two Opposition speakers also spoke eloquently in support both of the principle which I was enunciating and of precisely those penalties. For Senator Panizza now to turn around and deny those arguments is to deny the very arguments which two members of his Party strongly supported on a previous occasion, as a consequence of which my amendments are now a part of the law of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is relevant, of course, to this very narrow matter which is before the Senate; that is, whether these two matters-namely, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 and the motion which Senator Powell has proposed for a wide-ranging inquiry-should be dealt with cognately. Of course they should be dealt with cognately because they deal with different aspects of precisely the same problem which faces us. We are indeed dealing with a very serious problem: the registration and regulation of agricultural chemicals and pesticides which can cause and have caused very significant damage to the environment, to the health of farmers and to our agricultural export industry. They are very important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the Bill deals with the mechanisms by which agricultural and other chemicals should be registered and regulated; namely, by the creation of a Federal authority to replace the State authorities-a proposal with which we totally agree. On the other hand, the motion deals with the adequacy of those mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now with the importance of investigating the adequacy of those mechanisms to show how important that element is in relation to the operation of the foreshadowed body. I will deal with the way in which the new body will be totally dependent upon information which will come from the chemical industry. It is information on which that new body will decide to register a chemical or not, modify its terms of application and the conditions it will lay down for the use of that chemical. Let us look at a couple of examples. We have extensive literature that shows that chemical companies in the past have suppressed, filtered, distorted and invented information which has been given to the bodies not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. On the basis of that information government authorities have registered chemicals and those chemicals have come into widespread use and have had a very significant impact on people's health. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the example of dibromochloropropane (DBCP). In 1960 it was developed by the Dow Chemical company in the United States. Dow obtained evidence in its experimental work that DBCP caused sterility in male rats. DBCP got onto the market because that information was not revealed to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, which have the responsibility for registering such chemicals. The procedure in the United States is precisely the same as the procedure which has obtained in Australia up to the moment. That procedure will also obtain under the new legislation, because the new legislation does not envisage the establishment of laboratories or alternative sources of information for the registering authority. </PARA>
<PARA> DBCP was supplied to a number of formulators. It was supplied to the Occidental Chemical Corporation in California. In 1974, 14 years later, a group of workers sitting around and comparing notes in the lunch room at the Occidental Chemical factory suddenly realised that none of the men working in that factory had had any children for quite some time. Investigations then revealed that all those men were sterile. It took from 1974 to 1976 for DBCP to be withdrawn from the American market, and it took until 1979 for recommendations that DBCP, which had come into widespread use in Australia, particularly in vineyards, be withdrawn to be put through the individual State bodies in Australia. That was almost 20 years after Dow obtained information which indicated that DBCP caused sterility in male rats-information which was not given to the registering authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of the registering authority which is anticipated by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill is not in itself a sufficient protection to prevent very hazardous chemicals getting onto the market, because at the time when attempts are being made to get new chemicals onto the market the developing companies are very often either the principal or sole source of information relating to the hazards of those chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with an article which appeared in the journal Nature. When I mentioned Nature on one previous occasion, some members of the Opposition joked and said, `Is that something to do with skin flick photographs?'. I remind members of the Opposition who do not know what Nature is that it is probably the second most widely read science journal in the world. It was found that information provided to the United States FDA in relation to a drug had been very highly filtered. The journal states:</PARA>
<PARA>FDA regulation drugs and food additives is based largely on safety data submitted by the manufacturer of proposed new products. Thus, if manufacturer's test reports are unreliable, for any reason, much of the basis for FDA's regulatory actions could be open to doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>Exactly the same applies to the new body now proposed in the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . animal tests, it should be noted, are particularly important since they provide the chief means of identifying whether or not new products may have potential long-term problems such as carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity problems which don't show up in clinical trials on humans. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that teratogenicity and mutagenicity do not show up until later generations, and carcinogenistic problems do not show up for 15, 20 or 30 years. It is very important that we properly get information to the body which is now being set up so that that body will make a proper assessment. The article in Nature-the report of an FDA Commissioner, Mr Alexander Schmidt, in relation to a specific substance that was put before the FDA in the United States-goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The deficiencies . . . were uncovered during inspections of `major pharmaceutical firms, inspections of several private contract testing facilities, and internal reviews of toxicity studies of color additives conducted by FDA. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems included the following:</PARA>
<PARA> `Pathology reports submitted to the agency were inconsistent with the original autopsy records',</PARA>
<PARA> Microscopic tissue slides were conducted by more than one pathologist, each of whom came to different conclusions yet only the conclusions favourable to the drug were submitted to the agency',</PARA>
<PARA> No records were kept for any individual animal in one long-term feeding study, `despite the fact that the records were required for proper analysis of the study and were represented to the agency to exist'. </PARA>
<PARA>All these problems indicate potential defects in the structure the legislation would set up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I refer Senator Brownhill again to the point I am making, because I am not sure he was listening when I introduced this section of my remarks. We are really looking at two sides of the same problem. They are as close as two sides of a single coin. On the one side is the establishment of an authority to register and regulate agricultural pesticides and on the other side, through this proposed committee, is the consideration of the adequacy of that proposal. I am attempting to show here that the proposal in itself, as indicated by the legislation, is not adequate and it requires this Senate committee inquiry to look at some of these aspects. I am indicating some of those aspects which may come out and which will necessarily lead to improvements in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I continue in relation to the way in which chemical companies, and in this case a pharmaceutical company, have repeatedly distorted the information they have given to regulatory authorities, one of which is exactly comparable to the one this legislation intends to set up, in such a way that dangerous chemicals, including dangerous drugs, have got onto the market and posed a significant hazard. I made the point that despite the fact that records were required for proper analysis of the study and were represented to the agency-in this case the FDA in the United States-to exist, they did not exist. Animals were recorded as normal for a variety of factors, including awareness, appearance, appetite and thirst, when in fact the animals were dead. Drugs were administered to animals in a manner which made it impossible to determine how much, if any, of the required dosage was actually ingested by the animals. In one toxicity study gross changes of tissue began to appear yet management was not made aware of these alarming changes for approximately four to eight months. In a study done by an independent testing laboratory the Food and Drug Administration was told that animal tissue samples had been examined, when a review of laboratory records indicated that the tissue samples had never been collected. That is just a sample of what some of the chemical and drug companies have done in relation to the submitting of information on new substances which they have sought to register and have regulated, both in the United States and in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply conclude, because I do not believe this part of the debate should continue for too long, that the proposed committee and the legislation should be debated cognately. They are intimately related; they deal with two aspects of precisely the same problem and, quite contrary to what Senator Panizza was saying-that the setting up of this committee was a witch-hunt and that a committee would be likely to lead to damning revelations in relation to Australia's agricultural produce-the setting up of a better system and eradicating these evident defects, these gross distortions in the system, would ensure that Australia will have a better food supply for its own people and certainly will be able to establish that it has a much cleaner food supply so that we will be in a better export position. I can only suppose that those members of the Opposition who have spoken are not really concerned about farmers; they are really concerned about the welfare of the chemical industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few points as to why we should not debate cognately the motion to establish a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988. Firstly, the proposal of the Australian Democrats, with whom the Government is lying in bed, will duplicate the study by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), which is due to present a draft report early in December. It will also duplicate the work that has been undertaken by task groups formed by the Australian Agricultural Council. The issues that would be covered by such a committee are completely different from the issues in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, which we were debating the other day. Due to the duplication, the cost of the proposed inquiry, in my opinion, cannot be justified. It will be just a fishing expedition, as Senator Panizza has remarked, and it will reveal he Democrats' prejudices and obsessions about chemicals. Fringe groups will cause problems and their accusations will do a great deal of damage to this country's trade in the future. This will threaten the reputation of Australia's agricultural produce as being of safe and premium quality. We must always remember agriculture's importance to Australia: some 37 per cent of our exports in 1987-88 were made up of agricultural exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that in 1987 Australia was thrown by a pesticide scare initiated by United States testing authorities. The process of screening imported beef from Australia in turn painted Australian beef producers as irresponsible and chemical happy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think that the select committee that the Democrats are mooting will throw that scare back amongst the Australian people and our trading partners. I do not think that the Federal Government has done much to highlight the fact that the American authorities test only between 1,000 and 2,000 samples from their own entire domestic beef herd of 100 million cattle. At the same time they take some 4,000 samples from Australian beef imports. In other words, they were looking 6,000 per cent more closely at Australian beef than at their own. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian beef producers have looked at the chemical residue problem and have put their money where their mouth is. They have cleaned up the accusations that were made about the industry. So why have another select committee of inquiry to look at the problem? The consumer, I believe, is satisfied with the level of advice and protection that is currently being provided. The Australian Science and Technology Council, as I have already said, is just one body that the Government has set up to gauge and, in turn, set guidelines and to provide particular advice to bridge such areas of responsibility between governments and departments to make sure that we do not have those problems again. ASTEC, as I have said, will report in December. The duplication of expenditure is definitely not warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTEC contributes effectively to the development of government policies by maintaining links in the area of science and technology with the State advisory bodies and working with the appropriate government departments. The select committee, if it is set up, will duplicate those areas already being covered. In addition to its numerous published reports, the Council has provided other written advice on particular issues to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Government trusts ASTEC to provide accurate strategic advice on such critical issues as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer, yet the Democrats say that ASTEC is not good enough to do an inquiry, which it will come down with in December, into the agricultural industries. To debate these two issues cognately will cloud the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, which is to provide legislation for the clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The Democrats should be saying, `We trust ASTEC to look at such critical issues as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer, and we are also happy for ASTEC to look at the use of chemicals in agriculture'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my objection to the devious practice which is sought to be foisted upon us by a conspiracy between the Australian Democrats and the Government to cognately debate the virtues of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 and the notice of motion given by the Democrats to establish a Senate select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. Normally, cognate debates take place on the basis of some commonality in the two issues and the contemporaneous nature of the two issues. The proposal for a select committee has been lying around dormant-appropriately dormant, I might say-for 10 months; and begging no earlier attention, I might say. The legislation before us flows directly from the pesticide problems which afflicted the rural sector and our economy generally in 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed committee had its genesis in a proposition put to the Government by the coalition parties. Our proposal for a standing committee was launched on the basis of concern we had for the rural sector. We were seeking to identify the causes, the problems, and the effects of the unfortunate application of pesticides in certain farming areas. We were concerned to see whether there was some justification for compensation. We spoke to the Government on the basis of getting goodwill, uniformity and commonsense in respect to the problems confronting the rural sector. However, notwithstanding an initial wink and nod, the Democrats, in their normal plagiaristic, second-hand, old-fashioned way, learnt of our intentions and endeavours and themselves penned a notice of motion to set up a committee. The only difference is that our committee was designed to give succour and support to the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats' proposal is designed to drag this committee across the body of the rural sector-and at the expense of the rural sector. The one part of the economy which will suffer as a result of this bizarre inquiry will be the rural sector-the very group that we were concerned about when we initiated our first proposal for a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the proposed terms of reference (a), (b) and (c), which do not bear repeating, we see that, without exception, not one of them relates in any way to concern for the rural sector. This proposed committee is designed to attract all the fringe lunatic groups that attach themselves like some plague to the body politic of the Democrats. This committee will do nothing to enhance the rural sector, to preserve it, protect it, or provide it with assistance. It can only damage it. The Democrats know that. But where were they when the Government introduced legislation imposing on the farmers an additional $1.8m in one year, or an all up cost of $11.3m, for the cost of the national residue survey? Where were they when Senator Austin Lewis moved his motion for disallowance and we voted against imposing a further cost burden upon the rural sector? The Democrats voted with the Government to load yet another cost on to the rural sector. That is their concern for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just remember the events that took place in 1987 that caused this legislation and that prompted our standing committee proposal which has sadly ended up in this shambles of a committee thanks to the Democrats having done some deal, the manifestation of which we have not yet seen-or perhaps we have. One way or another we will see it on the floor of this chamber in a vote. I am reminded of the deal that the Democrats did with the Government on its resource rent tax. They opposed it the first time and agreed to it the second time. And at what price? The Government set aside a miserable $5m to investigate wind power as a source of energy to satisfy 16 million consumers in Australia. That was the deal the Democrats did with the Government to pass the resource rent tax-another cost burden on the energy consumers of Australia. We have this proposal at a time when the Government has loaded the rural sector with $11.3m of extra costs to put right the national residue survey, which was a disaster and which lead in the first place to the crisis into which the rural sector was plunged. The farmers have had an extra $11.3m inflicted upon them, with the support of the Democrats, on the basis that the Government could not afford to pay it. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the Government attempting to set up a committee at enormous cost to inquire into the effects of pesticides, not on the rural sector, but allegedly on the consumers. I ask: Who was affected at the time of that pesticide problem? Was there a consumer in Australia who ate one piece of contaminated beef, lamb or pork? Of course there was not! The only persons affected were the farmers who, having sold their contaminated beef, thanks to the incompetence of the Commonwealth Government, had to buy the beef back from the American purchasers. This proposal has no virtue and it certainly has no place in being debated cognately with this Bill. I see Senator McKiernan nodding his head in agreement. Let me just remind the Senate of what the Bill before us proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) protecting and enhancing trade and commerce in agricultural produce and livestock:</PARA>
<PARA>It is all about helping the rural sector. The Bill also proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) assisting in the conduct of agricultural and veterinary operations in the Territories;</PARA>
<PARA>Again this shows concern for the agricultural sector. It proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) minimising any undue hazard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the general public;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the environment;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) users of such products and other workers exposed to such products or to residues of such products; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) agricultural produce and livestock; arising from the application of such products;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) minimising the need for separate evaluation of such products by the registering authorities of States and Territories . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (e) ensuring that such products are effective in respect of uses for which they are cleared; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) ensuring that evaluation of such products is carried out in a timely and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA>All these matters are identified as ensuring the ongoing efficiency and protection of the rural sector and are in no way related to this bizarre and outlandish proposal that we have before us. As I have said, the Democrats' proposal in no way relates to the rural sector. It is a motion which, in its manifestations, can only do enormous harm to the rural sector of Australia. Given its emotive terms of reference and the Democrats' emotive style of presentation, it will attract prejudices, obsessions, distortions and untruths which are guaranteed to give an impression to the community that something is gravely wrong in the rural sector in respect of the application of pesticides. Of course, it is not. Our proposal was for a standing committee to examine the effects of these pesticide problems on the rural economy generally and on farmers-in particular those 1,130-odd farmers who had their farms quarantined; in the case of Western Australia, 183 farmers-and the 85,000 hectares of rich land that have been locked up and denied from further productivity as a result of the mismanagement of successive governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these farmers were on the verge of bankruptcy. The Federal Government's response was, `Let them agist at $2.50 a beast per week', in a dry season when there is no agistment and no $2.50 a week to pay for it. The Government's attitude was, `Transport them somewhere else at $13 or $14 a head', if I remember, for a trip of a couple of hundred kilometres, or, `Pay $80 a tonne for fodder', which is both unavailable and unaffordable to the average--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told by Senator Panizza that in some cases it would have cost $150 a tonne, and those farmers neither had access to the fodder nor had the funds to buy it. Those were our concerns and our anxieties. Those were the matters to which we were directing our attention. We were not using that crisis or the unfortunate, depressed, rural economy as a stepping stone or as a ladder to try to foist a committee upon the rural sector and the community as a whole, as the Democrats are trying to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposed committee has absolutely no virtue whatsoever and the Democrats know it. I repeat that, in my view, it will have the purposeful and acknowledged effect of attracting unwanted, unnecessary and certainly undesirable publicity, of a distorted nature, to Australia which, no doubt, will colour the judgments of the purchasers and consumers of our rural products. It is with some sadness that I note that this proposal is not dissimilar to other proposals we have had from the Democrats who are prepared, at any political price, to sell out Australia and the Australian economy in pursuit of political expediency. For reasons which are obvious to some of us and obscure perhaps to others, the Australian Democrats have chosen to ignore that the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) is presently inquiring into, in a proper, careful and disciplined way, all the matters, all the aspects that are raised in this bizarre proposal of the Australian Democrats. I understand the ASTEC committee will be reporting some time later this year. If there were any commonsense to be found in the Australian Democrats' proposal, they would wait until the findings of ASTEC were available and then determine whether or not a further inquiry was necessary. To do that, of course, would take from them the political points they think they can win. There is something altruistic about that. There is something reasonable about that-not matters in which the Democrats have a great deal of interest or the hallmarks of their political conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Liberal Party and the National Party as a coalition are totally opposed to the proposition of having an inquiry which has no virtue; it has no merit; it has no intrinsic commonsense; but it has a rotten smell of political expediency about it. Perhaps it is the hallmark of contemporary politics in Australia to see yet another grotty, behind the door deal done with the legitimate far Left of the Labor Party in this Parliament and the Government of the day. We have become used to it. The community is becoming used to it. No doubt as it is further revealed in the time ahead, people will turn away with distaste at the vulgarity of the Australian Democrats in their pursuit of a grab bag of votes in the desperate hope that they might retain their seats in the Senate for a moment longer. </PARA>

I believe this motion will be passed and it would be very disappointing if we had a re-run of those same speeches once the motion has been carried. As you have correctly identified, Mr Deputy President, I moved a motion that Senator Powell be able to move a motion which would allow a cognate debate on a Bill and a motion to set up a Senate inquiry into the general issue of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The only issues relevant, I think, are whether that is a good idea or not. I have not heard anything from the Opposition which argues whether it is a good idea to have a cognate debate.

No speaker in this Opposition has argued about lack of efficiency or lack of an opportunity to canvass their views.

Of course, in addition, we are now debating cognately the notice of motion to establish a Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. It is an absolute and utter disgrace that the vote that has just been taken in the Senate was actually supported by this Government. It was for the most inane proposition by the Australian Democrats, which is fairly usual, to establish a committee that will duplicate a study that has already been conducted by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), a study that is very comprehensive and goes right to the crux of the issue as opposed to the problems that are going to be created by the Committee that the Democrats and the Government have now established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The costs of this Committee will be extortionate and this inquiry simply cannot be justified under any circumstances. I find that it is even more fascinating to know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, only grudgingly supported the Australian Democrats push for this Senate inquiry. Of course, as my colleague Senator Lewis mentioned the day before yesterday, it makes one wonder what it is that the Government has offered the Democrats for this dirty little deal if the Minister has only grudgingly supported it, because there is nothing in it for the Government which will alleviate the residue problems that arose last year associated with chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Committee will be just an expedition revealing the Democrat prejudices and obsessions about chemical companies. Honourable senators know they have those types of obsessions. Senator Coulter has sat through most of this debate and stands up there for the greenies. So we know full well that the greenies will be brought in by the truck load for this Committee. We know full well that the chemical companies are going to be right under the hammer. There is no getting away from it; there are very valuable chemicals that are needed in the agricultural industry and yet these silly nitwit Democrats want to go about not only destroying the chemical industry but also creating increased difficulties for the rural sector in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA> This Committee will also have the potential to threaten our trading markets and our reputation. That, to me, is of great importance because how can we possibly have a committee that will start going about its business of trying to condemn the chemical companies without getting worldwide publicity that is in fact going to threaten our industry? The whole of the world is going to know that these Democrats, in their lack of wisdom, have decided that they are going to make the industry a laughing stock. Those honourable senators could not care less about the industry. We have heard Senator Powell rabbit on in here for days and days with the most inane contribution that anyone could ever wish to hear and without any understanding of anything that has happened out in the rural sector. It distresses me that there are people in this place who I guarantee have never been on a farm in their lives, much less gone out and talked to the people who have been affected by this chemical problem, the people who have been quarantined, the thousand plus farmers who have been quarantined as a result of this problem that the Democrats are now going to exacerbate further, and quite willingly further exacerbate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrat proposal does not recognise the need for speedy resolution of the problems of compensation and assistance to quarantined farmers. The Democrats could not care less about compensation and assistance. As I said last Friday, I do not believe that governments must rush to the aid of any section of the community simply because there is a problem but I think when it is a problem that is affecting so many people and affecting us as a nation then we must look at areas of compensation. This mob do not even want to look at compensation. All they want to do is create further difficulties for the rural sector. As I said before, the inquiry will just end up being this witch-hunt against all the 55 chemical manufacturers. The Democrats have not one jot of interest in or consideration for what the private sector groups think in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> If they were really concerned about the issue, they would probably listen to organisations such as the National Farmers Federation. They would probably listen to organisations such as the Cattle Council of Australia, the Wool Council of Australia, the Australian Horticultural Growers Council and the Australian Council of Egg Producers. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia, they would not listen to. However, one would think they might also listen to the Confederation of Australian Industry. Therefore out of those seven organisations which are opposed to this ratbag idea, there is only one that one would think, with commonsense, they would not listen to because they do not like the chemical companies. One would think that they would probably listen to the other seven, but no, they do not. Their attitude is, `Let's just shoot the farmers in the foot again'. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying the other day, Mr Deputy President, I am very concerned about the fact that the Government has been dragging the chain on this legislation. It is legislation that is needed and the damage that has occurred to the primary producers is largely because the chemicals that were used in Australian agriculture years after they were banned in agriculture in the United States were not considered by this Government to be undesirable. The organochlorins that were banned in the United States in the 1970s--</PARA>

Unfortunately for us, I think she is next on the list of speakers but she does not seem to be able to control her tongue at the moment. Nevertheless, I will try to carry on while she is rabbiting on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that my time is running out so I will conclude by saying that we must look at the problems of the farmers. As I have said, there are still more than 1,000 farms quarantined. These farmers have every reason to complain that the assistance they have received from the Federal Government is totally inadequate. The Liberal Party of Australia actually recommended a committee of inquiry that would look at compensation, but the Government would not come at that committee. That is how we have ended up with another stupid committee to assess:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the adequacy of arrangements under the legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and co-ordination systems for agricultural and veterinary chemicals; . . . the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems; and . . . the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Committee is looking at. Just imagine what will happen in relation to the last of those objectives:</PARA>
<PARA>the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats will wheel in the greenies on that point just to try to prove that the chemical companies are doing all the wrong things. Our proposal would have included the investigation of the use of such chemicals by government instrumentalities and the question of compensation and assistance to producers. Therein lies the difference. The Democrats want a witch-hunt against the chemical companies; we are trying to assist the producer. Clearly it suited the Government to divert the purpose of the committee from those matters that might embarrass it, especially in regard to assistance and compensation. It has refused to acknowledge the fact that beef producers were bearing the cost of a national problem which they did not cause. Instead the Government and the Democrats are trying to launch this inquiry which will do nothing to assist producers. In fact, our agricultural exports may actually be damaged if this inquiry provides a platform for those snake oil merchants who make wild statements about the harmful effects of chemicals which are essential to primary production and which pose no threat to health at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot hear the rabbiting on so there is no point in my responding to interjections. Probably they are inane, so I am lucky that I cannot hear them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will not look at the simple fact of life: there are chemicals which are essential to primary production and which pose no threat to health at all-none whatsoever. The Democrats will not look at that; they do not have the capacity to do so. Instead of looking at ways to assist the producers, the Democrats bring forward a proposal which could easily degenerate into a witch-hunt against the chemical industry. Yet the fact that we are debating this Bill to institute effective clearance shows that problems arise through lack of proper regulation, not the misdeeds of chemical producers. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the Bill but certainly opposing the inquiry, I foreshadow my support for our Opposition amendments which will ensure that the legislation does not create injustices or unnecessary problems for manufacturers. In particular I support the inclusion of the word `significant' in clause 22, regarding the obligation of companies to supply information to the Council. Without this qualification a company would be faced with heavy penalties for failing to report very minor and inevitable variations in testing. The Opposition is hopeful that the Government, having indicated acceptance of some of the Opposition's amendments, will maintain a very open mind to constructive alterations. I cannot finish without again further expressing my great concern at the decision that has been taken by this Senate, only a matter of minutes ago, to set up an inquiry that can only be dangerous to our exports and to our rural sector generally. </PARA>

<PARA>I will respond to some of the debate which occurred previously on whether this committee proposal in my notice of motion and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 ought to be cognately debated. I noted with interest Senator Crichton-Browne's comments that cognate debates are always about issues which are related. I vividly remember in my first Budget session as a senator being involved in a cognate debate of some eight or nine Bills. I had responsibility for three of them. One was on wool, one was on eggs and the other was on nursing homes. I tried very hard and with some difficulty to find out why those three Bills were cognately debated. The rest of the Bills were tariff and customs Bills. I really think that Senator Crichton-Browne needs to search his memory for some other examples. These two issues are closely related and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 is a very welcome move by the Government and one which has the support of the Australian Democrats. For more than a decade now, contrary to Opposition claims that this legislation is before us only because of the beef crisis late last year, the issue of national--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the Opposition senators said that-just check the Hansard. For more than a decade this issue of a national assessment scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals and industrial chemicals has been discussed. It has been recognised that a scheme that ensures uniform standards of registration and uniform methods of handling chemicals is necessary. I am pleased to see recent reports which indicate that the Government will introduce similar legislation relating to industrial chemicals later this year. The Democrats will support that move as well. With respect to agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the system that has operated over the past 20 years has involved State and Federal governments in cooperating on a voluntary basis to assess and clear agricultural and veterinary chemicals prior to their registration in each State under separate State legislation. I understand that at present there are more than 100 different pieces of legislation in the different States to cover a variety of aspects of chemical registration, sale and use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats agree with the Government that legislation providing for national assessment and clearance of these chemicals will improve and streamline the administration and the regulatory framework for the clearance and registration. We are pleased that the work carried out over a number of years has resulted in this legislation and that this has been achieved by the cooperation of Federal, State and Territory governments. A national and uniform approach was also supported by the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Council, which is established by this legislation, will be responsible for coordinating the elevation of chemicals proposed for registration in Australia and the granting of certificates of clearance for those chemicals which satisfy the assessment procedures. Membership of the Council will comprise representatives of the participating States, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Environment Council, the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers, and the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are aware of some concerns in the community that membership of the Council should expand to include other interests such as farmers, industry, consumers and environmentalists. Certainly the Democrats believe that all interested parties should have the opportunity of participating in various ways in such committees and councils. I note that in this case the legislation grants the power to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council to establish one or a number of committees to assist and facilitate its operations. I note from the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that he expects consultative committees with industry, consumer and environmental groups now operating under the Australian Agricultural Council's subcommittee system to be re-established under this Council. The Australian Democrats will encourage the establishment of such consultative committees, which will allow and enable greater input from the wider community in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other concerns have been put to us by industry and consumers which relate to the export of chemical products and to proprietary rights. We believe that our proposed Senate select committee, which we are now cognately debating with this Bill, whose terms of reference include reviewing the adequacy of arrangements under this Bill, will provide an appropriate forum for investigating those problems and any other problems with the implementation of this legislation. Again I stress that this is one of the positive aspects of the proposed committee. As I said, the Democrats are supporting the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address some remarks specifically to the proposed select committee, notice of which has been given by me on two occasions: in December 1987 and in April of this year. In the 10 months since I first raised with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, the possibility of establishing a Senate select committee, all the indications have been that such a committee is needed now even more than we had earlier believed. It is obvious that few people have forgotten the chemical residual crisis of last year, particularly in the beef industry. Few in the community would not have seen, heard of or read of other chemical related problems concerning a variety of agricultural products. In the last two years in particular Australia's farm leaders, agriculture Ministers, consumer groups and many farmers as individuals have called on Australia to lead the world in producing clean, unpolluted and residue free produce. The former President of the National Farmers Federation, Ian McLachlan, in May of last year outlined the concern in Europe and Asia over the levels of chemicals in foodstuffs as an example of an opportunity for Australian farmers-something said by an eminent farmer representative and rural politician which seems to have been utterly ignored by members of the Opposition in this debate so far. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1987, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Mr Evan Walker, stated that in his view Australia could become the world leader in selling clean food to international markets. He was quoted in the Sun of Thursday, 1 October 1987, as saying that there was a growing demand in Europe, Japan and the United States for uncontaminated food. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> With a little extra effort Australia, and Victoria, can become world leaders in supplying these kinds of commodities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Senate is about to add to the extra effort that the Hon. Evan Walker has called for, in establishing this committee, which will assist in Australia's rural industries picking up on that opportunity. Senator Haines, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, saw that opportunity for herself on a recent trip to Europe and brought it to the attention of the Senate in Question Time last week, subsequent to her return. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent Country Women's Association of Australia Youth of the Year, Mr Rod Knight from Coonabarabran-a farmer; a young farm leader of the future, I would suggest-said in an article published in the Land on 18 February this year that a big no-no for Australia is to follow the United States down the path of the heavy use of drugs and chemicals. Mr Knight said that, apart from the high costs and small margins involved, there was rising consumer demand for safe food free of chemical residues. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> With the alarming figures being bandied around in the United States of 20,000 cancer deaths a year being traced back to chemical residues, consumer demand and concern must be our major concern. </PARA>
<PARA>This young farm leader is one of the farmers who, we have been told by the Opposition, are not interested. </PARA>

Mr Knight also recommended the banning of growth hormones. That is another major issue. Growth hormones are being banned in Europe. That decision will impact on Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The South Australian Minister of Agriculture, Mr Kim Mayes, announced the formation of an advisory committee on agricultural chemicals in February this year, a committee which, I draw to the attention of the Senate, includes representatives from a wide range of interest groups, including farmers, environmentalists, unionists, organic farmers, chemical companies and various health advisers, including toxicologists and allergists in particular. Mr Mayes said in his press release:</PARA>
<PARA>When I decided that there was a need for such a committee-</PARA>
<PARA>this is another eminent member of the community who, it is said by the Opposition, does not believe that we need to do work in this area-</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted a group of people representing the wider community who would be able to look at the issue of chemicals in agriculture from a broader perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the view the Democrats have taken. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I looked for people skilled not only in the effects of chemicals on pests and on the quality of produce, but also on people on the soil and on the natural environment. I also believe that it is timely to look closely at alternatives to chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA>The wide range of issues which the Democrats have put before the Senate as needing to be investigated by the proposed committee is totally agreed with at the South Australian State level by the South Australian Minister of Agriculture in establishing his committee. Even chemical company representatives themselves have, rightly and responsibly, expressed concern. The managing director of the world's third largest chemical company, Rhone-Poulenc, as reported in March of this year, called on chemical companies to take `more responsibility and put ethics before profits and lead other companies and develop products with less environmental impact'. That is from a leading member of the chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that chemical companies are concerned about possible harmful effects of chemicals on individuals, the community and the environment. As I said earlier in the debate, Mr Alan Morley, the executive director of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association (AVCA), has kept me in touch with a number of initiatives the industry has taken. I have welcomed that. It includes having brought to our attention the updating of information. AVCA has taken a number of initiatives in the interim period of 10 months since we first raised this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that there is a misunderstanding in that organisation, Mr Morley being overseas, concerning what I said in the Parliament the last time I spoke on this issue, which was on Monday. I have checked the Hansard. I have not suggested at any time that Mr Morley would support this inquiry. I have merely said that he has kept me informed. I will be sending a copy of the relevant Hansard to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association. I do now what I did then, and commend any initiative which is taken or which might be taken by any section of the chemical industry, and certainly by an organisation representing the industry on this issue. I have in the chamber with me today an information kit which I believe is an advance. As I have said, I will continue to support initiatives the industry might take. I will quote from a draft document which Mr Morley brought to me. It describes one particularly useful and advanced way of expressing the problem which has come from the chemical industry. The document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before using any home, garden or pet care product, there are a number of important questions you have to ask yourself-and be able to answer. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Have I done everything I should and can do to keep my garden free of pests and diseases, my pets healthy and free of parasites, my yard free of weeds and my house free of vermin?</PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to list a range of-dare I say it in Senator Lewis's presence?-alternatives. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association is suggesting to people that there might be alternatives. I applaud it for doing that. The committee we propose intends to provide more information about alternatives. They may be alternative practices, alternative products, alternative processes or integrated systems of some chemical use and some use of alternatives. This is being cried out for in primary industry, as it is in the community. As I said, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association has put this suggestion in its own document. I commend it for doing so, although that is not to say that I think its record is perfect, by any means. However, I do not want it to be said that I have misrepresented AVCA's case. </PARA>
<PARA> These responsible initiatives are welcomed, as is the tightening of government legislation and regulations, an example of which we have before us today. The Australian Democrats and many people in the community recognise that many fundamental issues relating to chemicals and the future of Australian agriculture still need to be addressed. The Democrats see the establishment of a Senate select committee as providing a forum which can address these fundamental issues at a national level. At this point it is important that I quote some extracts from a recent paper by Professor John Lovett, Professor of Agronomy at the University of New England. I have referred to Professor Lovett's comments earlier in the debate, which has been going on for some days. Professor Lovett sets out in his paper, which we received just this year, some of the issues which need attention and hopefully resolution. Professor Lovett says:</PARA>
<PARA> The continuing pesticide controversy provides a classic example of the modern day malaise. No-one wants to take responsibility for pesticide-related problems-</PARA>
<PARA>if honourable senators care to read the Hansard of the last two or three days they will find that that certainly includes the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>and everyone would like to lay the blame at someone else's door. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the Opposition wanted to do. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In reality, of course, neither manufacturer, adviser, contractor, farmer nor anyone else involved with the use of chemicals in plant production is exclusively responsible for the complex problems which presently exist. It could be argued that they should have been foreseen, but this does not help to solve them. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant protection chemicals have been widely adopted because they appeared to offer simple answers to pest-related problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking beyond the immediate symptom of the problems some observers noted the impact of the intensive pasture improvement of the 1950's and 1960's. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to this intensive pasture improvement, Dr Lovett's thesis goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . increased the length of the growing season, increased total productivity, permitted higher stocking rates and induced greater agricultural productivity . . . However, in many areas where intensification took place the ring-barking of former times had left a tree population of uniform age. These trees were ageing and ill-equipped to withstand stresses. </PARA>
<PARA>But greater agricultural production and increased stock imposed further stress. This stress included compaction of soil around those few remaining trees, which damaged roots and prevented the establishment of new seedlings. The insect population boomed with the exotic pasture species being introduced and drought added to all of those environmental stresses. Professor Lovett concludes in this section of his paper:</PARA>
<PARA>Eucalypt dieback was the net result. The true cause was not the beetles-the obvious and simple answer-it was gross disturbance to the ecology of the region as a result of agricultural activity, a complex problem which could never be corrected by the short term, simple application of insecticides. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday's release of the coalition's environment policy actually gave me some heart, even in the middle of all of this ridiculous debate, when I read in that policy:</PARA>
<PARA> The degradation of land also results from the inappropriate use of agricultural chemicals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition in its environment policy contradicts everything that has been said in this debate and supports what Professor Lovett has said. I wonder whether the coalition in government will be about as good as this Government. In other words, are we to have a policy document that says something good but a government which does not implement it? If what Opposition senators have been saying is any indication that is a distinct likelihood. I did not find much in that environment policy to commend but I certainly commend that particular phrase. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer a little more to Professor Lovett's information especially as I have read to Opposition senators their own policy on this issue. Professor Lovett points out that, globally, agriculture has a history of about 10,000 years. Chemical agriculture has a history of barely half a century. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Buoyant post-war economic conditions permitted the rapid development of the major chemical industry with which we are familiar. Thus, although we regard chemical plant protection as the norm, it has a relatively brief history. </PARA>
<PARA> World sales of pesticides will exceed $US15 billion by the year 1990 . . . This amount is somewhat greater than the gross value of all agricultural commodities produced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics last year. When we look at the context of chemical agriculture and listen to what the Opposition has said about cranks, nuts and people who are interested in and earning a living involving themselves in non-chemical or minimum chemical agriculture we wonder what Opposition senators know about agriculture in its full historical context. Professor Lovett goes on in his very important paper-I have already offered to give copies to any Opposition senator who is genuinely interested in this issue-to talk about encouraging developments in integrated pest and weed management systems which combine various farming practices: biological control and chemicals. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a complex response to a complex problem, with herbicide used as one part of their management scheme. Had pesticides been employed in this way over their relatively brief history, the problems with which they are presently associated may never have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Opposition to listen to what Professor Lovett has said. I have listened to him. He has sent me this material since we proposed this committee. Obviously there are other people who are thinking straight on this issue. Professor Lovett is not a nut. He is not saying, `Kill the chemical companies. We cannot live with chemicals in any way'. He is not the only person around this country of some note who is saying those things. We are saying in support of this committee that this information needs to be brought together, that farmers in this country need some support and sense of direction to be able to move down this track, instead of having to do it on an ad hoc basis, as is the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> We all ought to be aware of the fast and ever-changing society we live in largely brought about by technology. We are also experiencing significant attitudinal changes. Certainly, as I have said before, the attitude in the area of agricultural and veterinary chemicals has been changing rapidly and recently in both urban and rural areas. This has been reflected in the rural press. In recent months it has been very hard to find a rural newspaper which has not been involved in the debate about the hazards of chemicals in each addition. The National Farmer editorial of 26 August this year, to which I referred the other day, faces up to the realities of these changing times in a way which the Opposition seems unable to do. It points out that `clean' food has become an international trade issue and will become more of an issue as this century comes to a close. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia is in a prime position to take advantage of it because of our remoteness from the ``dirty'' environment of the Northern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA> But to do so, we must demonstrate how ``clean'' we are again and again. Part of that demonstration is jumping on any problem-publicly and openly-</PARA>
<PARA>even, dare I say it, by way of a Senate inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>as soon as it appears, rather than waiting until we are told we have transgressed. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the assumption that the National Farmer editorialist in this case even believes we should be involved in some preventive measures. </PARA>
<PARA> In proposing this committee the Democrats were acutely aware of the signals coming from Europe, the United States of America and within Australia on this issue. As I said earlier, the European Community is implementing a ban on the use of hormonal growth promotents from 1989. In addition, it is undertaking reform of the common agricultural policy and the development of rural alternatives to promote farming systems which are not dependent on the use of fertilisers, chemicals and high energy inputs. In some regions in West Germany and Denmark incentives are being given to farmers to switch to organic systems. The New Zealand Government is similarly supporting, promoting and legislating for organic agriculture. Right now in the United States there is legislation before Congress which, if approved, will require all imports of raw agricultural products to be accompanied by a list of all pesticides used in production. This will impact on Australia. In addition, at local and State level in the United States community pressure has resulted in `right to know' clauses being included in all kinds of legislation. In relation to chemicals, such legislation recognises the rights of workers, consumers, farmers and residents to know the contents of the food they consume or work with and the regulations for neighbourhood spraying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats recognise that chemical fertilisers and pesticides have played a significant role in increasing food production in the past 40 years. At the same time we recognise that their use has increased 32-fold in the last 35 years, bringing with it documented evidence of lower productivity as soil quality declines, which is recognised in the coalition's environment policy; water pollution; danger to other species; and harmful effects to human health through long term exposure to chemical residues in food, water and air. In addition, the number of pesticide resistant insects and pests has increased, with many resisting even the newest chemicals on the market. These issues are profoundly important for Australia's domestic and international economy. </PARA>
<PARA> An issue about which great concern has been expressed in words in the Senate recently-particularly on the Opposition side, and very much so in the case of the Democrats-is the reduction in funding for research generally, but particularly rural research in my case. Dare I suggest that the process of gathering this information, putting it before a Senate committee and having such a committee report to the Senate might actually improve our chances of ensuring that the Government funds the sort of research that is necessary into such issues as pesticide resistance, integrated pest management and the other issues to which I have already referred. These issues, as I said, are profoundly important for our whole nation and our whole economy-our agricultural resource base and the health of our people. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report from the World Commission on Environment and Development entitled Our Common Future states:</PARA>
<PARA>Ecology and economy are becoming ever more interwoven-locally, regionally, nationally and globally-into a seamless net of causes and effects. </PARA>
<PARA>I strongly resent the suggestions made earlier by Opposition senators that the Democrats have only recently become concerned about this issue. They do not like our being concerned, and they accuse us of coming to that concern only recently. Improvements in this area were among the very first objectives of this Party when it was formed in 1977, and many of the people who have joined the Party, including my colleague Senator Coulter, have a fine history of activism, work and knowledge in this area and have an understanding of the concern expressed in the international report from the World Commission on Environment and Development. The report, in its sections on agriculture, says that there is no doubt that nations must `promote ecologically sound farming practices' in order to ensure sustainable agriculture for the people of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia increasing numbers of farmers want to learn about more ecologically alert farming practices, perhaps the most spectacular example being the recent field day held in Senator Bjelke-Petersen's home State of Queensland by Graham and Sandra McNally, when 1,300 people came to see the farming practices that those people use. But individual farmers and organisations cannot and should not be expected any longer to undertake the information sharing and promotional processes involved. Dr Kate Short from the Total Environment Centre said recently:</PARA>
<PARA>A decrease in the use of pesticides is a question of transition. They do play a role in agriculture at this time. However, we are also in the position of being able to look at the alternatives. The problem has been that the people who have had this expertise do not have the resources and monetary backing to communicate these methods and ideas to others. </PARA>
<PARA>They certainly have a struggle communicating them to the Opposition. Governments have a responsibility to the Australian people to play their part in ensuring and promoting purity in our agricultural products; maintaining and expanding our markets; and ensuring the health of our community, our agricultural resource base and our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that Australia must take stock of where chemical dependence could lead us and of the alternative options that are open to us; hence our move to establish a Senate select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the terms of reference of which emphasise future directions and strategies so that as a nation we can address the problems and challenges for agriculture with foresight and in a responsible way. My colleague Senator Coulter will make some further remarks. We will be moving amendments in committee simply on the question of penalties. I commend the Bill, as an enlightened piece of legislation, and the establishment of such a committee, to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity of participating in the debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988. In doing so, I state that the Opposition generally supports this legislation. However, we are debating cognately with this Bill General Business notice of motion No. 70 brought forward by Senator Powell on behalf of the Australian Democrats-aided and abetted by the Government-to establish a Senate committee of inquiry to investigate the wide-ranging use of farm chemicals in Australia. The Liberal and National parties are opposed to the establishment of the committee proposed by Senator Powell, as was obvious from the vote in the Senate earlier today. I believe that the establishment of such a committee is an entirely different matter from the Bill that we are debating. The committee proposed by Senator Powell would give people the opportunity to come before it and allege that chemicals being used by primary producers in Australia are poisoning our food and primary produce. This would be to the detriment of the sale of our primary produce on world markets-but, then, I do not think the Labor Government or the Democrats worry too much about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt there are some in the community who question the use of chemicals in food production, but most people would agree with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Kerin, that the controlled use of chemicals in food production has been justified. The Senate must realise that the Democrats' proposal would duplicate the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) study of chemical residues in agricultural products, the draft report on which is expected in early December. The Democrats' proposal for a committee of inquiry would also duplicate the work undertaken by task groups formed by the Australian Agricultural Council. I believe that, because of these duplications, the costs of the proposed inquiry cannot be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Democrats' proposal reveals their prejudices and obsessions about chemical companies. Senator Powell's motion does not recognise the need for a speedy resolution of the problems of compensation and assistance for quarantined farmers. The National and Liberal parties were aware of the effect of the residue problems on the rural sector and, particularly in Western Australia, have moved to have something done. I believe that the inquiry proposed by the Democrats could develop into a witch-hunt aimed at Australia's 55 chemical manufacturers. In my opinion it is stupid even to consider moving for a Senate inquiry, as proposed by the Democrats and supported by the Government, when the ASTEC study of chemical residues in agricultural products is not complete and the report on which, as I said earlier, is not due until early December. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the Bill before the Senate. It should be noted that the agricultural and veterinary chemicals industry and the widespread and safe use of chemicals, particularly in the advanced agricultural economies of the world-Australia being one-have transformed agricultural production. The productivity of farmers and the ability to store food products safely have been transformed. Without these tremendous developments in chemicals, the world would now be starving-regrettably, there are many starving people in the world-and even here in Australia we would not have the ability to sustain our large and growing population. Australia would be a far poorer country without the widespread use by farmers of these chemicals, thus enabling us to feed ourselves and to export desperately needed products so that we may maintain our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of all the incentives and advantages given by government to the manufacturing and other non-primary industries of this country, agriculture today provides a net 50 per cent of our total exports, produced by about 5 per cent of our population. I believe that that is a tremendous achievement. Those who criticise the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are often themselves beneficiaries. They enjoy the standard of living that we all enjoy but have the hypocrisy to criticise the use of those very chemicals. Chemical companies, farmers and State departments of agriculture in Australia have a very good record in the use of these chemicals. I was interested to read in the Australian last week a report of comments by Mr Alan Morley, Executive Director of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>He urged pesticide regulators to adopt a higher profile to reassure consumers that present laws and regulations on chemicals were sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> It was important the public received reassurance from an independent `referee'. </PARA>
<PARA> `It is not enough that consumers are being protected. They must be told and reassured,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1950s my husband, through our aerial spraying company, did a lot of work in western Queensland spraying brigalow. The fact that brigalow was killed by such spraying enabled vast areas of western and central Queensland to be developed and grassed and naturally gave the opportunity for graziers to run many more sheep and cattle on such country. It is obvious to me that agricultural chemicals have played a part in development and production in Australia. Even at present on our property at Kingaroy we are growing kiwifruit and avocadoes, all of which have to be sprayed with chemicals to stop fruit-fly. Of course the same spraying has to be carried out wherever fruit is grown. I think of the apples and grapes in the Granite Belt in Queensland, of all the fruit in the orchards of New South Wales and of Victoria, which you represent, Madam Acting Deputy President, as well as in Tasmania and South Australia-indeed, wherever there are orchards throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However not only is the consumer, by consumer choice, largely protected from any sort of hazard by the use of modern chemicals, but also there has been a real effort to ensure that the chemicals applied to crops are applied in a form and at a concentration that will not put the ultimate consumer at risk. As a nation we are dependent on the use of farm chemicals. Indeed, a good deal of the food produced across the globe disappears because it is consumed by some form of pest or disease. There is no doubt that we will have an increasing dependence on chemicals if we are to continue to help a hungry world. There is no doubt that chemicals rank with mechanisation in providing us with the opportunity to increase our agricultural production. It is interesting to note that 100 years ago one farmer produced enough food to feed six people. Today, that farmer produces enough food for 70 people. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out in addition that there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of land available for tillage thanks largely to chemicals. We often think of pesticides as being the only chemicals used to get our fruit, vegetables and grain crops to us in a consumable form, but we forget that weedicide use has been one of the major inputs required to increase agricultural production. These weedicides, rather than being chemicals that we ought to fear or that people say are in some way destroying our environment, have been a key in allowing us to secure much of the environment that machinery would formerly have destroyed. However, we do have to remember that aggressive use of agricultural land does have its problems. Landholders must be aware of them and balance the use of chemicals and their safe containment against the benefits of increased and cheaper production of food and, indeed, clothing. Another problem that must be recognised is the runoff of agricultural chemicals into streams and oceans, and also the problem of the rising watertable and hence salinity. However, rural people are responsible people who want to do the right thing by the environment, by the land and by the population at large. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate proposes the establishment of an Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council which will enhance the uniformity of agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation across the States. It is to be hoped that the legislation will ensure that those chemicals work well, while lessening the hazard they might pose to the environment, and allow us to reassure those who buy our products on the export market that what we are providing to them is the sort of foodstuff that they can consume safely. It is proposed that chemicals currently in use in Australia should be regarded by the proposed council as cleared for use, while new products will be evaluated to ensure that they can be used safely. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate will allow exporters and consumers to be assured that the chemicals applied to the fruit and vegetables they sell or eat will not put anyone at risk. However, the Senate should note that the Queensland Government does not want to go ahead with the arrangements in the Bill as it stands at present. The Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, the Hon. Neville Harper, has written to Mr Kerin saying that Queensland does not like the agreement it is being asked to enter into, and has suggested an alternative agreement. As at Friday the Federal Government had not replied to Mr Harper's alternative agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Before completing my remarks I do wish to mention a number of private sector groups that are opposed to the Australian Democrats proposal to set up a committee. I refer to the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Wool Council of Australia, the Australian Horticultural Growers Council, the Australian Council of Egg Producers, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia Ltd and the Confederation of Australian Industry. I note, too, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy himself has said he only grudgingly supports the establishment of the committee proposed by the Democrats. I do not know why the Minister did not organise Labor members and say he would not have it at all, because it is not necessary in view of the Australian Science and Technology Council study on chemical residues of agricultural products under way at present. I believe it would be much more sensible for the Senate not to waste its time setting up a committee until after the results of the ASTEC study are known, and if there are then any issues outstanding they could be looked at. I certainly support the Bill but I am still not in favour of the committee proposed by Senator Powell on behalf of the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Senate has voted to debate cognately the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and the motion to set up a Senate committee, because as I indicated earlier I believe they are closely related. I want to establish first of all my credentials for speaking on this matter. Certain statements have been made about greenies, with people asking where were they before the beef residue story broke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the early 1970s I had already been concerned for many years, through my association with the environment movement, about the use of organochlorin pesticides in Australia, particularly because of their persistence in the environment and because of their solubility in human body fat so that they tend to accumulate. In the early 1970s I carried out what to my knowledge is still the largest survey of the content of DDT in human body fat that has ever been carried out in this country. I looked at autopsy specimens from over 300 people from a wide range of occupations, estimated their DDT levels, and looked at the occupations they had had during their life, their causes of death, and the illnesses that had been associated with them. Rather interestingly, I found that there was indeed an association between higher levels of DDT in human body fat and those causes of death which came within the broad ambit of malignancy. I am not saying, and I could not say from that epidemiological study, whether DDT was causing an increased incidence of cancer in Australia. For instance, it may be that, because DDT was used on tobacco crops and because smokers have a higher incidence of cancer, so those who smoked had a higher expectation of developing cancer and also had higher levels of DDT. Nonetheless, the association was there. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons I undertook that work was that from the 1960s I had been concerned about the use of these chemicals in Australia and had indeed been attempting for 20 years to head off the use of these very persistent chemicals on such a widespread scale. It is therefore rather distressing to hear people such as Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Brownhill criticise people like myself for not having taken action which much earlier might have headed off the whole problem with the beef industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As long ago as 1963 Rachel Carson wrote the book Silent Spring. As well as being an excellent author, she was a very celebrated marine biologist. She really did know what she was talking about. But nobody took any notice at that stage. To turn around, as Senator Knowles has done, and criticise the greenies for wanting to look at the subject is simply not to recognise that, if the greenies had been taken notice of 20 or more years ago-and I am proud to be called a greenie-Australia would not have a problem with the residues of very persistent chlorinated organic compounds in beef tissues. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one could also draw attention to the fact that by the late 1960s and early 1970s assays of human breast milk were showing evidence that, had it been cows milk and put on the market, it would have been banned. We had that evidence in the late 1960s and we had it well corroborated by the 1970s; yet again as a nation we took no action. It was only other countries becoming concerned about the health of their residents and taking action against our beef exports which caused Australia to take action which should have been taken and would have been taken, if those in the environment movement had been listened to, many years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no intention whatsoever of blaming farmers. Farmers, to a large extent, have been the meat in the sandwich in this whole unfortunate business. As I will develop later, farmers have been exposed to information about chemicals predominantly from chemical manufacturers and departments of agriculture. They have had very little information available to them from other sources which would have allowed them to take a more comprehensive view. That is one of the reasons why this Senate committee is being created-to provide other sources of information. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is just one example of another chemical with which I have had some association in my existence as a medical practitioner. Many years ago I was consulted by a farmer on the west coast of South Australia who had been driving his tractor on his farm, using 2,4-D as a weedicide on his wheat crop. I am not talking about DDT or other organochlorinal chemicals; I am talking about 2,4-D. He had been so overcome by this chemical that he became almost unconscious. He attempted to drive out of his farm gate with the arms on his boom spray still unfolded, with quite catastrophic consequences for both the tractor and the boom. He was not found until some hours afterwards. When he did not turn up at home his wife came out to find him slumped unconscious beside his tractor. It took him some nine months to recover from that episode. He had severe disturbances of his mental processes. He was getting headaches, insomnia, and so on, and was quite incapable of working for quite a long time. We are not in any sense wanting to blame farmers. Through the creation of this committee we are attempting to establish a system which will ensure as far as possible that farmers in the future will get independent sources of information and will not, therefore, be in a position in which their products can be banned, their farms quarantined, and their livelihoods interfered with.</PARA>
<PARA> One factor that convinces me of the need for this committee is that the regulatory bodies in Australia so far, that is, bodies set up under State departments of agriculture, have been extremely conservative with respect to the registration and regulation of chemicals and have more or less taken the view that chemicals are safe until proved unsafe. I will give one current example of why we need to set up this committee. The agent albendazole appeared only during the 1980s. The Australian Agricultural Council, in resolution 7 of its recent report of its 130th meeting, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Council NOTED that authorisation in the United States for albendazole was withdrawn in 1985 because of concerns that it was carcinogenic. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was capable of causing cancer. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has examined the same toxicological data but does not agree that albendazole is carcinogenic. The NHMRC Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Committee has recommended that the maximum residue limit (MRL) for sheep muscle be increased from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg and that the MRL for edible offal of sheep be increased from 0.1 to 3 mg/kg . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a 30-fold increase in Australia, yet in 1985 the Americans banned the use of this agent because they believed it to be cancer causing. Furthermore, it recommended that the 10-day withholding period be deleted. I refer also to the Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology, volume 23, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been some indication of teratogenic effects-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, birth defects-</PARA>
<PARA>with albendazole and cambedazole. </PARA>
<PARA>This indicates that we still have in this country conservative attitudes in relation to the registration and regulation of chemicals and that further down the track we are very likely, if these practices are not changed, to run into further problems similar to the beef residue problem which will impact adversely on farmers and on Australia's trade and which could be avoided if we were to turn this very conservative attitude around and take what I believe to be a more responsible attitude to the use of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly am not in any sense opposed to the use of farm chemicals. The vast bulk of farm chemicals probably are quite safe, but to assume that all farm chemicals are safe and that even ones that are registered and used according to directions will not have adverse effects is simply to put one's head in the sand. But it seems to me that that is what the Opposition is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry, amongst other things, is to look at the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems. Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who spoke just before me, talked about fruit-fly. There are non-chemical ways of addressing the fruit-fly problem. There are biological control mechanisms. The sterile male technique has been particularly successful and I believe was developed around the fruit-fly problem. So there are non-chemical ways of achieving the same sorts of objectives and, to the extent that they are practical and economical, they should certainly be used in preference to chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Another term of reference is:</PARA>
<PARA> the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>In contemplating the use of farm chemicals we are not simply looking at the farm industry in isolation. Senator Bjelke-Petersen said that one farmer now provides food for 70 people. Of course, she happens to be wrong because a lot of the people who support that farmer by way of making the chemicals, transporting them, applying and testing them, making the farm machinery and providing the fuel for all these other things, are also a necessary part of that food production. So it is a bit simplistic to say that one farmer feeds 70 people. I believe that, directly or indirectly, some 25 per cent of the Australian population is linked with the production, the transporting, the processing and so on, and the making of food available to people. </PARA>
<PARA> Conventional agriculture, as practised in Australia in recent years with its broad acre farming and heavy use of chemicals and pesticides, has brought a host of problems. It is distressing to find that the Opposition is taking such a narrow, backward looking view. It is really locked into an economic, exploitative view which should have disappeared many decades ago. We should be taking the view that we have a responsibility not only to this generation but also to generations for a very long time in the future and we should be doing all that we can to preserve the productive capacity of farmland. In many instances, the farming practices that are currently in use have not achieved that. I think the Opposition agreed, when Senator Powell put up a motion recently relating to soil degradation, that there has been massive soil degradation in Australia. Part of that is related to farming practices, some of which relate to the use of chemicals and artificial fertilisers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that degradation, the livelihoods of many farmers have been ruined through the contamination of their farms with pesticides. Figures have already been given in relation to the number of properties that have been quarantined. Moreover, some of the farms have been quarantined not because the farmers deliberately applied these chlorinated organic pesticides to their farms but simply because contaminated material was brought in quite unbeknown to them. For example, one South Australian farmer had his entire herd of 400 pigs shot and buried when his farm was quarantined. It was discovered that the pollution had come from 50 tonnes of feed barley bought from a farmer across the border in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years the senior officer in each State and in the Commonwealth responsible for the registration and regulation of biocides-and I use the term `biocides' quite deliberately because the words `pesticide' and `herbicide' are really euphemisms; we should recognise that these are general biological toxins that we are talking about-with only one exception, came from the agricultural chemical industry. Many of them had had a very long period of employment in the agricultural chemical industry before they became the senior officer responsible for the registration and regulation of these biocides. It is not surprising, therefore, that consistently, over a long period, farmers were being given one type of information from both the chemical companies and the departments of agriculture-namely, that the way to go was to use agricultural chemicals and any suggestion from anywhere that there were alternative ways of producing food were simply rubbished. I put on the record that, in the mid 1970s to the late 1970s I addressed a large number of seminars in universities and colleges of advanced eduction all around Australia and I debated this very question with people like Jack Snelson, the head of the Commonwealth authority. On every occasion I was rubbished for suggesting that there was any problem associated with agricultural chemicals. So I certainly do not blame the farmers, who have been presented with that monolithic source of information, who have accepted that chemicals were suitable and quite safe and who simply went ahead and used those chemicals on their farms with, as we now know, in many instances quite disastrous results. </PARA>
<PARA> At issue here are matters not only of scientific fact but also of judgment and emphasis. As I indicated earlier, I think it is fair to say that Australia is still-I believe quite mistakenly-taking a very lenient view with respect to biocides. I have given the example of albendazole which is banned in one country but which is still available here. I will give another example in the area of household pesticides. The agent dichlorvos was shown in 1973 to cause mutations. In 1979, when on the Four Corners program I showed a product manufactured by Bayer Australia Ltd, that company issued a $10m writ against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The writ was recognised as a stop writ; it stayed in place for 12 months. It was then quietly dropped and was never tested in court. In the meantime, Bayer continued to advertise that product vigorously on television. I believe that subsequent evidence has established that dichlorvos is a cancer-causing agent, yet that product is still widely available on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, within established government committees there is a presumption that chemicals are safe until they are proved guilty. I believe that a more rational and reasonable attitude would be to accept that there is a point when sufficient evidence has been accumulated against a chemical for the onus of proof then to pass to the chemical company to establish that that substance is safe. I believe that we still have on the Australian market a number of substances that have passed that point but which are still in quite widespread use in this country. I emphasise again that that is not a matter of scientific argument or fact; it is a matter of judgment. I simply lay down that my judgment is that the fair, intelligent and more humane way to go would be not to treat chemicals like people charged with criminal offences before the courts-innocent until proved quilty. We should not extend that right to chemicals at all. But when sufficient evidence has accumulated against chemicals and there are serious question marks over them, the onus of proof should shift and, until their safety is established, they should not continue on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers are justifiably bitter because their State departments of agriculture encouraged the use of pesticides for nearly 20 years after those departments should have known of the risks. I have already indicated one of the reasons why that is so. If one were to apportion blame, rather than blame the farmers I would fairly and squarely put the blame very much on the Federal department and the State departments of agriculture. One of the things that the Bill before us does is to establish a central unifying council which will look to the matter of the registration and regulation of chemicals. That is a step in the right direction, provided the attitudes which permeate that council are not as conservative as the attitudes which have permeated individual State departments of agriculture and the Federal department hitherto. </PARA>
<PARA> It is both disturbing and instructive that the actions that have been taken over these farm chemicals have not been taken in response to the oft repeated concerns which I have indicated earlier, which have been raised by the conservation movement-the so-called greenies; a term which the Opposition uses as a pejorative, but which I accept with pride-but have been taken in response to the economic penalties which have been exacted against our produce by foreign countries. Again I think it is worth stressing that the interest in Australia has not been about the health and welfare of Australian people. The concern has been about the damage to our industries. I would suggest that, rather than wait until Americans become concerned about the health of Americans eating Australian produce or the Japanese become concerned about the health of Japanese eating Australian produce, we should long before have been concerned about the health and welfare of Australian people eating Australian produce and taken some action. Had that occurred, there would not be any farms quarantined in Australia at all and farmers would be much better off. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out earlier that 25 years ago Rachel Carson in her book, Silent Spring, alerted the world to the environmental impact of pesticides and herbicides. Yet the agricultural producers, the industry councils and agricultural departments have been amazingly slow to test livestock and produce, to quarantine properties showing unacceptable levels of chemical residues, and reluctant to penalise farmers who circumvent bans-and there have been some farmers who circumvented bans-on the use of certain pesticides or contaminated land. There is still a serious unwillingness on the part of these departments to consider the chemical impact in its broad ecological context. Even if we were to get as far as considering the human impact, we should be taking a much broader view of that and looking at the overall ecological impact-the impact on non-target species and the general sustainability of the environment and its ability to maintain itself indefinitely in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Departments of agriculture, to say the least, have been very shortsighted. Apart from the environmental and health problems caused by the excessive use of pesticides and chemicals on farms, Australia's best opportunity to win, to hold and to expand market shares is to capitalise on the clean environment image we have and to extend that image. To argue, as the Opposition has argued, that somehow the creation of a select committee which will allow all and sundry to come before it and give evidence is going to impugn the safety and the cleanliness of Australia's food supply or Australian exported foods is to argue that we should have no Senate inquiries at all in any area whatsoever in which some nut might come along and give evidence which would damage an industry. I think it is a sad reflection by the Opposition on their fellow senators to impugn that process by suggesting that those senators would not be quite capable of working out those claims which were unsubstantiated, to support those claims which are substantiated and to carry them forward by way of recommendations for changes to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is still an extensive need for changes in the legislation along the paths I have suggested. Last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, said that all State governments apart from Tasmania had allowed an unregulated use of such chemicals as dieldrin and DDT, even though they were aware 15 years ago of the environmental problems associated with them. Looking at dieldrin, I was recently-in fact, literally just before I came into this place as a senator last year-on a South Australian Government committee looking at the problem of contamination of a school with aldrin/dieldrin, where the applicator had grossly applied aldrin to the school building, which had occasioned the whole school being evacuated for one whole term while a massive clean-up was carried out, the cost of which was almost the cost of the school. The South Australian Government was at the point of considering whether it was less expensive to tear the school down and build another school than to try to clean it up. </PARA>
<PARA> So even though again we have the prospect in this Bill that the registration and the regulatory mechanisms will be supervised at the Commonwealth level, nonetheless some overall supervisory role for the Senate in relation to the use of these agents and their alternatives is highly desirable. The Australian Democrats agree with Mr Kerin that the unregulated handling of biocides and chemicals in this country is `an unholy mess'. The Federal Government refused to finance the $30m a year residue testing program imposed on producers after the detection of pesticides in beef shipments to the United States and Japan last year. Research funds are still directed to conventional agriculture. This month the National Farmer reported that the Federal Government's innovative agricultural marketing program had funded-wait for it-a crocodile egg incubator, a mango slicer, aroma hops and research into fish bait. After this debate had begun I noticed in the Advertiser of 8 October that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy was calling for applications for research grants, stating:</PARA>
<PARA>High priority will be given to market-driven projects. These may include aspects market development, transport, post-harvest handling, processing, production. Projects dealing with post-farm gate issues are particularly encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>So we still have the Federal Government orienting itself more towards the downstream end of the industry, rather than the input end where the methods of productivity need to be carefully scrutinised so that agriculture becomes a sustainable activity in the long term which does not cause serious and irreparable damage to the environment. </PARA>

I will be but a moment but I want to say that the last speaker, in the course of his comments, made the observation or allegation that I had complained that the Australian Democrats had not helped the rural industry earlier. That is not what I said. What I said was that they never help the rural industry. I went on to make the point that the proposed committee to inquire into the use of on-farm chemicals could do nothing but damage the rural sector. It was designed to damage the rural sector. It was in no way related to the rural economy. My criticism of the Australian Democrats was not that they were slow in recognising a need for assistance to the rural sector but simply that they were producing a motion which would create a great deal of hardship, damage and financial loss to the rural sector in a very cynical and unpleasant way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a statement to the Senate concerning unparliamentary language. Yesterday during Question Time I required the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, upon an objection being taken by Senator MacGibbon, to withdraw a reference the Minister had made to Senator Crichton-Browne holding goldmining shares. There was some querying by interjection of my ruling. On examination of the transcript of the question and answer, I find that Senator Cook referred to Senator Crichton-Browne as having a vested interest in the issue, and could be taken to impute an improper motive to Senator Crichton-Browne in asking the question. The remarks of Senator Cook were therefore, on balance, such that it was appropriate for them to be withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During an answer yesterday by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, to a question asked by Senator Newman, Senator Chaney took a point of order relating to certain remarks by the Minister, and I ruled that the remarks were not unparliamentary. On examining the transcript of the answer, however, it appears that Senator Richardson was attributing an offensive description of Senator Newman to other persons. As the Privileges Committee indicated in its report in September 1979, and the Standing Orders Committee in its report of March 1980, it should not be permissible for honourable senators to use unparliamentary language by the device of quoting another person, and Senator Richardson was doing that in a rather subtle manner. Senator Richardson could therefore properly have been asked to withdraw his remarks.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will appreciate that it is often difficult to follow remarks made by senators, especially when there are interjections and other distractions in the chamber, and it is only when the transcript is examined that the effect of some remarks can be fully appreciated. I would ask all honourable senators to closely observe standing order 418 and not make offensive or improper references to the other honourable senators or honourable members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware that Dr John Hewson, the Liberal spokesperson on finance, has recently been criticising the Government's monetary policies? In light of Dr Hewson's background and experience in the banking area, is it the Government's intention to take Dr Hewson's criticism seriously and alter monetary policy accordingly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago, I think it was, I saw a long rambling letter in the Australian Financial Review written by Dr Hewson and I have heard reports about some other statements. It is true that Dr Hewson has a background in banking which, combined with his academic qualifications, should suggest that he has some idea of what financial markets are all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, the Macquarie Bank Ltd clearly values him very highly. From 18 July to 25 July last year the bank paid for Dr Hewson to go to Tokyo and visit its clients. From 26 September to 4 October, again last year, it also paid for Dr Hewson to go to the United Kingdom and the United States of America to meet Macquarie Bank clients and to deliver the Macquarie Bank's presentation at the International Monetary Fund-International Bank for Reconstruction and Development meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear whether the Macquarie Bank received advice on monetary policy matters from Dr Hewson. According to Dr Hewson's statement of pecuniary interests, he is neither a director nor an economic consultant to the bank although the bank's 1987 annual report records him as `Director and consulting economist'.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the Macquarie Bank, a Sydney Morning Herald article of 12 October noted that out of nine friendly society investment bonds surveyed, the investment bond managed by the Macquarie Bank was the second worst performer over the financial year 1987-88. This demonstrates that over the course of 1987-88 either the Macquarie Bank was not listening to Dr Hewson's advice or he was not giving it very good advice. I invite him to clarify his current relationship with the bank.</PARA>

The simple point is that it is easy for the Opposition to suggest that if it were in government it would make a whole lot of difficult decisions that the government of the day is not prepared to make.

But it is difficult for me to answer the question whether or not I agree with Greg Harrison because he was commenting on a misrepresentation of what I said on television on Sunday. I will just explain the nature of that misrepresentation to honourable senators. I said that there had been some very extravagant figures quoted in terms of tax cuts and that Australia could not afford those extravagant figures. Within half an hour that question and answer was changed to `Australia cannot afford tax cuts'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Finance seen a report on the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald that a major Sydney property developer had helped arrange the provision of cars, through the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, to a member of Mr Greiner's staff and two political appointees in key senior Public Service positions-the head of the Cabinet Office and the head of the Department of State Development? The report also claims that a car company provided a vehicle to another member of Mr Greiner's staff. Will those vehicles be assessable either for income tax in the hands of the recipients or for fringe benefits tax through the organisations providing the vehicles?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report reveals that the arrangements in relation to the provision of the vehicles were, to say the least, ambiguous, and that will make it difficult to determine the tax liability, if any. A major part of that ambiguity, of course, relates to attempts to cover up what actually happened-for example, by the Liberal Party belatedly paying for the vehicles despite the protestations of its State director and the even more belated attempt by the recipients to return the vehicles when they realised they had been caught. It is indeed a curious arrangement that vehicles now apparently owned by the Liberal Party were in the first instance registered in the names of the recipients.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The Minister was specifically asked who would pay the tax in relation to these vehicles. At this stage the Minister is rambling on about ownership-the transfer and change of ownership. He has not, in any way, started to address the question. We are aware that this question is phrased in this way to enable the Minister to get up and make a statement, but I ask you to listen very carefully to what the Minister is saying to ensure that he restricts himself to answering that part of the question which relates to his portfolio and does not take the opportunity to take some general swipe at something about which he clearly knows no more than what he has read in the newspapers.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that is precisely what I am doing. I am explaining why it is difficult to determine where, if anywhere, the tax liability resides for the reasons that I have already given and for other reasons which I am about to give. The key question in tax liability is in determining the relationship between the providers of the vehicles and the recipients. The key component of that is whether the recipients of the fringe benefit, in this case a vehicle, are employees of the person or organisation which provided the vehicles. If the recipients were not employees but had received the vehicles as payment for some service which had been rendered or was to be rendered, then the value of those vehicles would be assessable in the hands of the recipients for income test purposes. Another possibility is that provision of the vehicles may have been in the nature of a gratuity, in which case it would probably not be assessable for tax purposes, nor would it be deductable from the taxable income of the provider, assuming the provider had a taxable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All those possibilities would admit a relationship which was quite likely to involve a conflict of interest with public duty between those who originally paid for the vehicles and the recipients. I do not envy the Australian Taxation Office in having to get to the bottom of this complicated issue in order to determine the tax liability. However, I imagine it might get some assistance from the Greiner Government's Independent Commission Against Corruption.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I note that, in the Cabinet decision on the Helsham inquiry, Cabinet put two conditions on granting a woodchip licence to Huon Forest Products Pty Ltd (HFP)-first, that there should be sufficient wood resources available; and, secondly, that there should be consultations with local residents. Will the Minister make public the resource data and information which the Tasmanian Forestry Commission and the Minister's department will use to assess whether there are sufficient wood resources in southern Tasmania to allow the issuing of a woodchip export licence for Huon Forest Products? Secondly, will he make that information public in sufficient time to allow local residents, the wider public and Cabinet to come to an informed decision? Thirdly, will the Federal Government refuse infrastructure support for the Wesley Vale pulp mill unless the Tasmanian Government meets the Federal Government's standards on public input and allows appeals to be made against environmental conditions set for the Wesley Vale mill?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1570" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I should say that the opening comment by Senator Sanders that the Cabinet decision on the Helsham inquiry put two conditions on the woodchip licence to Huon Forest Products is not true. I sought to impose those conditions to enable a logical framework to be developed for resolving a complex and difficult issue. I thought it entirely proper that those conditions be stated and known publicly as conditions of approach by me to a consideration of the issuance of a licence for export of woodchips by Huon Forest Products. Senator Sanders is right when he says that the two conditions were that there be a demonstrated resource and, because of concerns expressed by some citizens in the Huon Valley, that there be consultations for a point of view to be put by Tasmanians on the matter of the export licence. There is a third condition-and it is one in which Senator Richardson has an interest-that any such development should meet environmental standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first part of Senator Sanders's question concerned the information there might be about the resource. The Tasmanian Government has notified the Commonwealth of the available resource for the development of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd (APM) and Huon Forest Products in the south-west of Tasmania. Because of complications with that advice, a four-sided meeting between the State, the Commonwealth, Huon Forest Products and APM will be held on Friday in Tasmania in order to get an agreement on the database for the availability of the resource. We will evaluate the particular claims of Huon Forest Products and APM and in light of that we will make a decision about resource implications. After that meeting, I will be in a position to say whether it is appropriate for me to release those figures.</PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the question was whether the information would be released in sufficient time. I have already partly answered that. Senator Sanders asked whether I would inform the Cabinet of the information, the implication being that I do not keep the Cabinet abreast of this type of information. Of course, it is my obligation as the Minister for Resources to make a decision on an export licence, but naturally I always consult my colleagues where necessary, and that includes those in Cabinet, if and when necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the third part of the honourable senator's question about the APM, the Wesley Vale pulp mill, the first thing that should be said is that Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, should be congratulated for bringing about, after a long and difficult period of protracted negotiations, an environment in which APM could announce the go-ahead of the Wesley Vale mill. Some 2,400 jobs will be created in the construction phase, 700 jobs directly and indirectly will be created in the operational phase and $300m will be added to our balance of payments, as about 90 per cent of the product of the mill will be exported. That is consistent with our value added approach.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the third part of the honourable senator's question is best directed to Senator Button, who is the Minister responsible for infrastructure in relation to this development, or Senator Richardson, who is more concerned about the environmental conditions to be applied. All I can say in relation to it is that the Tasmanian Government, in this morning's Launceston Examiner, said that it will err on the side of toughness when it comes to making an environmental evaluation and no doubt we will be keeping an eye on that.</PARA>

That remains the position. There is no change from what I said 20 minutes ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as the question of indulgence by the Australian economy as a whole is concerned, let me say, as I have said over five years in this place, that the Australian economy is going through a difficult period of structural change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The political situation in Burma at the moment is that the military regime in Burma remains officially committed to holding free multiparty elections in Burma, the electoral commission is continuing to work and political parties continue to be formed and to register with the commission. However, no date has been set for the holding of elections. General Saw Maung, moreover, has set the restoration of law and order and the restoration of Burma's food, fuel and transport problems as preconditions for the holding of the elections. It is simply not clear when, if at all, the regime is going to regard those preconditions as having been satisfied.

Now that we have had another bad monthly current account figure, for September, with a deficit of $990m-call it $1 billion-and bearing in mind the Minister's comments 10 days ago that we should at least wait for that figure to be released, is the Government now closer to having to `do something further on the outlays side of the Budget', as the Minister suggested was inevitable `if the current account deficit continued to run at much higher levels than had been anticipated'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I should say is that of course I reject Senator Stone's judgment about the September current account figure. Indeed, to apply what I regard as quite significant evidence to that, I might comment that I was discussing with a journalist this morning what the current account figure might be. I said, `Frankly, I don't have the faintest idea and I don't believe anybody else outside the ABS does, although a few people are quite willing to hold their hands out with advice, based on pretty specious evidence, about what it might be'. I said to the journalist that in my view any figure below $1 billion would be good news. That is what I said before I knew what it was. Admittedly, it has scraped in at below $1 billion. Honourable senators should bear in mind the point I made in the television interview to which Senator Stone has referred: there is a seasonal factor in Australia's balance of payments, with exports tending to be lower in the first half of the financial year than they are in the second half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question, I suggest, is irrelevant because it is based on a false premise. I want to make a couple of other observations about it. The first is that Senator Stone and some other people would have made massive changes to policy last October based on assumptions of economic horrors because of the share market crash at that time. He was advised by me and a number of other people in the Government to wait and look at what happened before there were any panic responses, before launching the lifeboats even though the ship was still in the harbour. He was likewise advised after the first two admittedly somewhat worrying balance of payment figures for the first two months of this financial year. The September figure is very much better and quite consistent with the Budget forecast. I repeat the warning that I gave before: it would be premature on the basis of even three months figures, let alone one or two months, to make any firm judgment about the final outcome at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> In Senator Stone's comments about outlays, he of course inadequately quoted what I said. I explicitly said that I did not believe this would happen but that if there was a continuing run of very bad monthly balance of payments figures which precipitated a run on the dollar then probably some response on the outlays side of the Budget would be necessary. That, however, would pale into insignificance if compared with the response on the outlays side, consistent with a responsible fiscal policy, which would be required if the $20 billion men, Messrs Peacock and Howard, were actually to proceed with their irresponsible proposals for tax cuts of $56 a week for people on average earnings and pro rated above and below. This would take away $25.5 billion of government revenue, wiping out the surplus and leaving an even bigger deficit than Mr Howard left behind him in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> Even as a proportion of gross domestic product it would be a great deal higher than the prospective $10 billion that Mr Howard left behind him in 1982. Of course, what would the chances of the Opposition be of making any adjustments on the outlays side of the Budget? The only person in the Opposition with the courage to do anything about outlays has just been sacked from the front bench.</PARA>

Am I to understand the Minister's response as implying that he, like the Prime Minister, is taking on the colouration of complacency which was reflected in the Prime Minister's remarks on this matter only yesterday evening inasmuch as he appears to regard a deficit of $1 billion or within $10m of that for September as being all right? In fact he said anything under $1 billion would be a good figure. Is the Minister really telling us that he is approaching today's figure with that degree of complacency and in doing so is he also telling us that he accepts as appropriate and as consistent with the Budget forecast of a $9.5 billion deficit for the year a deficit for the first three months, of over $3.8 billion which is more than 44 per cent of the annual figure?</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has been concerned at a statement by the Israeli Defence Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, last month that the Israeli Army was deliberately seeking to wound more Palestinians in a drive to crush the nine-month uprising, indicating the Israeli Government's willingness to inflict often serious injury on Palestinians in an attempt to quell violence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for his question. In terms of the Ballarat goldmining development to which Senator Panizza has referred and which was the subject of a question to me two days ago, the investment obviously was committed to that development before it was announced in the May economic statement that the goldmining companies' exemption from normal company tax would end. The significant aspect is that, in the face of that announcement, the investors continued to proceed with their investment and to the development of that mine. Indeed, as I said in answer to the earlier question, 20 new mines-some of them very significant and major mines-were announced before June of this year and in the latter half of this year some 30 new goldmines will commence operation. The fact that investors are continuing with their investment knowing that the special exemption for the goldmining industry will no longer exist indicates, in my view, that the closing off of that exemption will not have the dire consequences that some spokespeople for the mining industry suggest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the honourable senator's question related to accelerated development. Of course, some miners can engage in accelerated development if they wish to invest further in the technology or the labour requirements that are necessary to work quicker to win a bigger body of gold. Indeed, one can see that today's prices on the world market-$US413.35 or $A510.30 for an ounce of gold-are a significant incentive. Our estimate is that it takes about $A300 to cover the operational costs of most goldmines. Their return on the world market at today's prices is $510.30 and that is a good incentive for them to continue. But they run the risk, if they try to accelerate their development, of bringing down that market price by putting more gold on the market. That is a sort of self-defeating tautology.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my answer a few days back I said that we predicted that investment in the Australian goldmining industry would peak in about 1990. We stand by that prediction. I should say that that prediction was made before the May economic statement was put down, and it remains true. Because we still cleave to that prediction as being an accurate forecast for the development track of goldmining in Australia and in view of the evidence that I have given about the number of mines to come on stream, I suggest that we cannot hold the removal of the special exemption from company tax for goldmining companies as a deterrent to further development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator talks about the amount of exploration work being done. For most small prospectors-people who are not companies-the application of company tax will not have any effect. Might I also say that when on 1 January 1991-because I believe the legislation will pass both Houses of parliament by then-the loophole is closed off there will be 100 per cent deductability for exploration expenses as well, and that will be a deductability against the tax which will at last be paid by goldmining companies. So the incentive to maintain the exploration regime at a high level is still there and ultimately the final determinant is the prospectivity of the areas to be looked at and the price. The price is holding up very well-I gave the figures a moment ago-and the prospectivity is quite good for most parts of Australia where gold prospecting is going on at the moment.</PARA>

When the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island ceased operations at the end of last year approximately 1,800 people were living on Christmas Island. About 800 of those residents have since chosen to leave, and the vast majority have gone to Western Australia. Following an independent assessment of proposals to recommence phosphate mining on Christmas Island by the liquidator appointed to wind up the Corporation, the liquidator recommended that the Government commence negotiations with Elders Resources Ltd on 22 September this year. The heads of agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth of Australia, Elders Mining Pty Ltd, Elders Resources Ltd and the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island in liquidation.

The agreement requires the developer to enter into an agreement with a reputable casino operator approved by the Commonwealth to operate the casino. The developer nominated Federal Hotels Ltd to be the operator. The Australian Federal Police conducted an investigation into Federal Hotels Ltd and reported to the Government that its inquiries had not revealed such information as would cause the Australian Federal Police to recommend against the company being granted a licence to operate the proposed casino. On the basis of that report the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories announced on 7 October last year that Federal Hotels Ltd had been accepted by the Government as the operator of the proposed casino on Christmas Island.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and refers particularly to the so-called Button car plan. Is the Minister aware that since the introduction of his car plan in 1984 the prices of basic Holdens and Fords have increased by a staggering 68 per cent while the average weekly wage has increased by only 21 per cent and that to purchase one of these motor vehicles now requires the equivalent of more than 41 weeks wages while a similar purchase in 1984 would have required only 30 weeks wages? Can the Minister inform the Senate when he expects the promised benefits of his car plan to begin to be felt by Australian consumers, or is the cost of vehicles still expected to rise further in terms of the number of weeks wages required to purchase one?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am corrected-like a couple of hundred thousand people, I read the Australian. I read some of those allegations in the Australian on Saturday, and yesterday or today I saw an editorial which followed up, in a nebulous sort of way, the allegations made in the article in question. A number of points have been raised, and I will try to deal with some of them. In 1988 car prices have been very stable in comparison with the period 1984 to 1987. The car industry has announced its view that that price stability for motor vehicles will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point I make is that measuring car prices in terms of units of average weekly earnings really ignores the changes in living standards for Australian workers over the period we have been in government as a result of the real wage restraint which has been shown by the Australian work force. It has shown that wage restraint and it is the Opposition which has opposed every wage increase during that period. It was also under the Opposition, when it was in government, that we saw unemployment at record levels and there are now a million more people in jobs than there were at that time who are able to buy cars.</PARA>
<PARA> Among other things alleged is that the fringe benefits tax and the sales tax arrangements introduced as part of this Government's policy have been detrimental to the motor vehicle industry. This is alleged in an Australian editorial this week. An examination of the figures does not suggest that that is true at all. The impact of the fringe benefits tax on the motor vehicle market in past years has been tiny compared with the impact of the devaluation which has led to increases in the prices of imported cars and increases in prices--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the honourable senator mean the floating of the dollar? I know he disagreed with that at the time and subsequently denied it, but now it is 1988. The fact is that the impact of the devaluation was a significant increase in prices both of imported cars and of the components which go into locally made cars. If honourable senators look at the alleged impact of the fringe benefits tax on the fleet market they will see that the fleet market has not declined in terms of overall numbers nearly as much as the overall market over the period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of other misrepresentations-not that this is of great interest to the bulk of the Australian community-in the Australian article which appeared last Saturday. For example, it compares a Daimler-Benz in Germany with a Daimler-Benz in Australia in terms of wage movements in both countries. The Daimler-Benz which is marketed in Australia is a totally different car from the basic model Daimler-Benz which is marketed in Germany and which was used in the Australian figures. There are enormous specification differences between those two models. I can document that if Senator Walters wants me to. One can go through these issues one after another. The moment I read the Australian article, which is ill informed, I knew that it would fall straight into the lap of those in Her Majesty's Opposition, who are equally ill informed, and that they would pick this up and ask a silly question like Senator Walters's question.</PARA>

There are one or two other aspects which Senator Walters asked about. She asked whether the car plan was in trouble. The car plan is not in trouble at all. The car plan is on track. It was designed to reduce the number of models in this country, to reduce the number of competitors in the business, and to provide economies of scale for the car industry, because it is a volume industry. That is all on track. We have moved from 13 models to eight models; from five companies to four consortia, and probably shortly to three. That will produce greater efficiencies in the industry. For the first time in 15 years, next year we will be exporting $300m or $400m worth of built-up motor vehicles. It never happened under a Liberal government. It will happen under this Government. It will happen very largely because of the car plan.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer to Senator Tambling, following his question on Friday in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission regional boundary maps. The map, I am informed, was prepared on the basis of advice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders throughout Australia. In most cases this advice was given during the Minister's consultation meetings or follow-up meetings earlier this year. The map referred to was drawn up by a professional firm of graphic artists. This map is not intended to be used by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in undertaking elections for regional councils and commissioners. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill provides in clause 75 (1) for the Minister to determine boundaries and publish those boundaries in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. It is those boundaries which the AEC will utilise to undertake elections. The boundaries set out in the map set out the jurisdictions of 60 regional councils throughout Australia. The membership of regional councils will be part time; members are not equivalent to parliamentarians. This map reflects the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities' response to the earlier jurisdiction set out in the Foundations for the Future statement. One of the aims of distributing the map widely is to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities the opportunity to confirm that it reflects their wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The actions of building industry unions in Victoria, supported by the Victorian Labor Government, in victimising and harassing self-employed building trades subcontractors working on industrial and commercial building sites, for whom such work was arranged by the labour hire agency Troubleshooters Available, and the necessity for the Hawke Government to take urgent action to assist in preventing further disruption. </PARA>
<PARA>In September 1985, a little over three years ago, I brought before the Senate an urgency motion concerning the campaign of violence, thuggery and lawlessness then being waged by a militant, extremist, Libyan-backed union, the Federated Confectioners Association, against the Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd, a small business in Melbourne. That dispute involved, amongst other things, an attempt by the union to overturn an agreement reached voluntarily between the company and its employees on terms and conditions of employment. History records that the Dollar Sweets case subsequently became one of the landmark cases in Australia's industrial relations history. Following action initiated in the courts by Dollar Sweets, in early 1988 the union made an out of court settlement of $175,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate I initiated in this place in 1985 was a key catalyst in pursuit of the Dollar Sweets case. That case proved at least three points. Firstly, it proved that the pursuit of the proper processes of the law will lead to just outcomes. As a result, the civil courts are increasingly being used to settle disputes rather than industrial muscle and intimidation. Secondly, it proved that resistance by small businesses to union strikes, black bans and other forms of coercion has strengthened and this, in turn, has had an enormous impact on the behaviour of trade unions. Thirdly, the Dollar Sweets case proved that the trade union movement is no longer seen as invincible in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dollar Sweets case was not unique in the industrial relations history of the late 1970s and the 1980s. Rather it was one of a small group of cases which has had a profound and beneficial effect on the pattern of industrial relations. The cases to which I refer were all ones where what seemed initially to involve almost insuperable trade union dominance proved not to be so because of the willingness of employees to stand up for their legal rights and to invoke the proper processes of the law. In this context I might also mention the live sheep export dispute of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the use of wide combs in the shearing industry, the South East Queensland Electricity Board dispute, Mudginberri, and the recent and very important decision relating to the firm Castle Bacon Pty Ltd. Most of these cases were all about the ability of employers and employees to deal directly with each other at the enterprise level. Of course, this is a central objective of the Liberal and National parties' industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Time may well indicate that the dispute I bring to the attention of the Senate today will rank in importance with those I have just mentioned. This dispute concerns a small business called Troubleshooters Available which I will hereafter refer to as Troubleshooters. The foundations of Troubleshooters go back to 1973 when one of the present proprietors, Peter Bosa, set up an agency called Labourers and Carpenters Pool to supply tradesmen to the building industry. The Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) declared war on that agency and, through an intensive campaign of harassment and black bans, forced its closure in 1975. In 1976, Bosa restarted the business, this time under the name of Troubleshooters Available. In 1981 he was jointed by Brian Groves as a co-proprietor. Since 1976, Troubleshooters has been subject to a continuing series of attacks from the building unions. In more recent years, the main protagonist union has been the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU). </PARA>
<PARA> Troubleshooters is part of the building industry. It is located mainly in Victoria but has an offshoot in Queensland. Its problems are confined to Victoria. It is planning to expand nationally. Troubleshooters is a labour hire agency which supplies temporary, well paid, self-employed tradesmen to contractors in the commercial and industrial sectors of the building industry. In effect, the agency organises and deploys a highly productive labour force on short term contract. Once the task or job is completed, the subcontractor may be available for other short term work, either through Troubleshooters or through his own contacts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a concept with great appeal to the building industry which is subject, of course, to huge fluctuations in workloads. Troubleshooters' services are in high demand. The company has up to 300 subcontractors covering a wide variety of skills and disciplines in the field at any one time and a further 1,000 available for replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Troubleshooters has grown during the 1980s it has, as I have said, encountered major problems from the building unions and these problems are accelerating. The company has been subjected to an extraordinary amount of harassment, intimidation and victimisation. Much of this has come directly from the building unions. The unions, though, have been supported by Victorian Trades Hall Council officials and by various Victorian Government departments and agencies. Troubleshooters has received no assistance and no protection whatsoever against these attacks either from the Victorian Labor Government or from the Hawke Government. Neither of the relevant Ministers, Mr Crabb in Victoria and Mr Willis federally, has even been prepared to meet with the proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle at issue in this matter is the right of individuals to subcontract their labour as self-employed small businessmen. It is also about the right of a firm such as Troubleshooters to place these subcontractors on unionised, industrial and commercial building sites. The dispute is not about whether the subcontractors should be union members. They are all members of one or other of the recognised building unions. They all have union tickets, they all have building union superannuation tickets and they all have long service leave tickets. The problem is not about whether the self-employed small business subcontractors belong to a union-they all do. Rather, the problem is about the power of the unions and their demand to determine the nature of the subcontractors' employment. It is a fundamental objective of the building industry unions to make all building workers wage earners rather than be independent and self-employed. The unions want a wage earning labour force for several reasons: it is easier to organise industrially; it is more likely to bow to the dictates of the union organisers themselves; and it is more likely to take industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent subcontractors, self-employed small businessmen, threaten the power of the unions to control the work force. For this reason independent subcontractors are anathema to the union movement and not only in the building industry. According to the Australian Small Business Association, subcontracting `is under attack as never before in Australia. Governments and unions seem to be acting in virtual conspiracy to squeeze subcontractors out of the economy'. </PARA>
<PARA> An agency such as Troubleshooters, which is able to organise and productively deploy a large number of independent subcontractors, represents a challenge to the totality of union control in the industrial and commercial building industry. Since Troubleshooters began to mature and grow in the early 1980s, it has met fierce and, in many instances, illegal opposition, firstly from the BLF and then from the BWIU. Building industry union officials declared the company to be black and threatened builders with industrial action unless subcontractors were removed from their sites. Subcontractors were threatened with permanent black bans within the industry and, as a result, business began to slide. Builders and subcontractors were reluctant to place their names on a black agency's books. Builders were quick to divest themselves against agency workers if a project was threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> Groves and Bosa, the proprietors of Troubleshooters, negotiated directly with the union leadership about all these matters, but after consultation with their subcontractors Troubleshooters refused to do the one thing that the building unions insisted on, and that was to alter the status of the independent self-employed subcontractors in order to turn them into wage earners. This was not in the agency's power, nor was it in the interests of the subcontractors themselves. Seeking a mutually satisfactory solution, Troubleshooters sought advice and assistance from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Master Builders Association of Victoria, and the then Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Crabb. None of these organisations or individuals offered any constructive assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Troubleshooters was left with no choice other than, through the courts, to seek protection of the subcontractors' right to work. Commencing in July 1987 a series of court actions was initiated. Most of these actions have been successful. In some instances actions or investigations have been dropped. The most notable of these involved the Building Industry Long Service Leave Board. In July 1987 it mounted its fourth investigation of Troubleshooters in six years. In February 1988, on legal advice, the Board dropped all claims. There are very strong indications that these investigations over that period of six years were the result of collusion between the building industry unions and the Long Service Leave Board. High-ranking union officials are prominent members of that board. The subcontractors, whom Troubleshooters place work for, work neither for the company nor for the builders who hire them temporarily. They run their own businesses and work for themselves. The independent status of the subcontractors who work through Troubleshooters has been verified by the Australian Taxation Office and by the Victorian Payroll Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Troubleshooters took the step of serving writs for protection and damages at common law, the building unions and particularly the Building Workers Industrial Union have been more reluctant to openly place black bans on building sites and risk incurring more common law damages. Instead, the unions' strategy has relied on other disguised or backdoor attacks. They have turned instead to other illegal ways of crushing the independence of subcontractors. Because legislation appears to allow union officials to close a site that they deem unsafe, it gives union organisers an industrial weapon to rid their sites of agency labour. To protect their subcontractors from trumped up claims about safety and to ensure the safety of their subcontractors, Troubleshooters itself now has 50 registered health and safety officers working through the agency. Safety on site is not the issue here. The issue, as I said, is the abuse of power by union officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest BWIU tactic is slander and lies, an example of which I now show the Senate. Honourable senators will note the swastika and the offensive words. I seek leave to table the poster. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Posters and stickers such as these have been put up around building sites in Melbourne by union officials. These same officials have asked that they not be named `or we will be in trouble'. What code of conduct motivates people such as this? Where is the courage of their convictions? They deny having anything to do with these stickers and posters, after placing them directly into the hands of various subcontractors. Such actions I believe are contemptible. In its 12 years of sustained harassment from the building unions, Troubleshooters has been unable to obtain the formal support of builders' organisations and in particular the Master Builders Association of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons for that appear to be twofold. The first is that the Master Builders Association of Victoria is dominated by the major construction firms, whereas Troubleshooters' clients are small independent businessmen. The second, and related to the first reason, is that the Master Builders Association of Victoria is a signatory to the Cain Government's building industry agreement on behalf of a number of its major contractor members. The other parties to the building industry agreement are the Victorian branches of a range of building unions, the Victorian Building Trades Union, which covers such trades as bricklayers, plasterers, slaters and tilers, and the Cain Government Minister for Labour. The Victorian building industry agreement is highly restrictive. It represents a deal done by a Labor government, unions and large building contractors. It outlaws various types of subcontracting. The agreement works totally against the interests of small independent businessmen like the proprietors of Troubleshooters and the independent tradesmen whom they place in work on building sites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely against the interests of consumers. What it does is to attempt to destroy the capacity for self-employed contractors to work on building sites if that work is obtained through agencies like Troubleshooters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The building unions have set out to destroy Troubleshooters for one simple reason, and that is that the unions see Troubleshooters' activities as a threat to their power. That is what this is all about. It is about power. It is about union power. It is about the power of the unions to control workers. It is not about whether people are members of a union. As I said, all the Troubleshooters' independent subcontractors are union members. It is not about the level of payment for work performed. The Troubleshooters' subcontractors are all highly paid. They are paid a long way above normal award provisions. I repeat: this matter is about whether building industry unions should be able to exercise restrictive, domineering, costly controls over subcontractors in the industrial and commercial building sector; whether the unions should be able to force independent small business subcontractors to lose their independence and become instead paid employees under the control of powerful trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a huge difference between the structure of the industrial and commercial building sector in Australia and the domestic housing industry. The housing sector is run almost entirely on a subcontract basis. As a result, the housing industry in Australia is the most efficient such industry in the world. In contrast, our industrial and commercial building sector is highly inefficient by world standards. For example, it takes some 50 per cent more man-hours, and even more cost, to build a high-rise commercial building in Australia than it does in the United States, despite the fact that in the housing sector we are more efficient than they are in the United States. The reasons for the differences in efficiency between the housing and non-housing sectors in Australia are very clear. They are the dominance in the non-housing sector of powerful unions, restrictive work practices, and the virtual exclusion of independent subcontractors. These inefficiencies in the industrial and commercial building sectors hit every consumer. Food is dearer because supermarket costs are higher. Rates and rents for office space are dearer. This gets passed on to consumers. Industrial products cost more because the factories in which the products are made cost more to build. And so it goes on right through our total cost structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from letting the unions, with the assistance of compliant Labor governments and the major building firms, further destroy the role of the subcontractor in the industrial and commercial building sectors, we should be doing all that we can to encourage and develop the role of the subcontractor. Subcontracting offers the best-perhaps the only-chance of introducing the flexible working arrangements and the efficiencies essential to control and reduce costs. The Australian dream of owning one's home is already rapidly becoming a mirage under the policies of this Government-policies which have pushed housing costs and prices and loan repayments beyond the reach of most average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> If, by any chance, the union dominance, restrictive work practices and attacks on the subcontracting system that are the hallmarks of the non-housing sector were to extend to the home building sector, the results would be catastrophic. Gone forever would be the tradition of home ownership that is one of the great strengths of our nation. The prospect of this occurring is by no means impossible. Indeed, Mr Rothman, a witness for the building unions appearing before the building industry inquiry on 6 July this year, said that the housing sector should be considered as part of the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has brought forward this urgency motion not just because one particular firm and the subcontractors for whom it arranges employment have been the victims of a long running campaign of intimidation and harassment by the building unions in Victoria. That is bad enough in itself and it is sickening that neither the Cain Government in Victoria nor the Hawke Government has lifted a finger to alleviate the situation. The Federal Minister, Mr Willis, for example, said this matter was entirely a State matter. That is not correct, of course. On the contrary, when the Opposition attempted to amend the Hawke Government's Industrial Relations Bill in ways which would, inter alia, have impacted positively on this type of practice, the Government stubbornly refused to accept those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> This urgency motion is really about the right of the average Australian who wants to be independent, to remain independent, to have a job. It is about the power of the unions to prevent this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say, in reply to that point of order, that there are two ways this matter can be dealt with. I presumed that when this motion was brought forward, it would be brought forward in a reasonable, rational way-not in the way it has been brought forward. That is the first point. Secondly, I want to say this: I can use the fact that they have not kept to the spirit referred to in Odgers as that which should apply to parliamentary debates as evidence of the propriety, as evidence of the genuineness, of this particular matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, people can be accepted if they get up and debate the question of union victimisation. They can debate the question of whether or not people should be treated as self-employed building trade subcontractors. That can be debated in a particular context but when it is debated in the context where a very important court case, a federal law court case, is about to take place on 3 November, that has a lot to say about the propriety and about the genuineness of their approach to this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA> May I just go through what this is all about-about this group Troubleshooters Available and its approach to legal proprieties. May I say this to start off with: since about the time the Victorian building industry agreement-the green book, which I will come back to-was negotiated, signed and has been in operation, since August 1987, there has been a dramatic fall in the time lost in the building industry in Victoria. Victoria's share of the national time lost in the building industry has dropped from 29.7 per cent, that is, almost 30 per cent in 1986, to 6 per cent over the nine months from August 1987-and this agreement I am about to talk about was signed in October 1987-to April 1988. That is as a result of the agreement between the unions and the Government-and not only the unions and the Government but also the Master Builders Association in Victoria. I have a copy of this agreement signed by the Master Builders Association of Victoria, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the State Government and a group of unions. All have acted very responsibly pursuant to the terms of this agreement. This has brought the most outstanding advance in building that Victoria has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking about the law, the next thing about this Troubleshooters group is that it was subject to a dispute settling procedure set up under the Victorian industry agreement. The dispute was whether the people that it paid were subcontractors or employees. The decision went against this group. The disputes tribunal said that they were employees. So what did this group do? It took them to court and joined them together as respondents with the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the State Building Trades Union-the bricklayers-and that is the case that is about to come on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said here that the people who are paid by Troubleshooters are self-employed building contractors. What did the judge who decided the case have to say about that? The answer to that question was available to the Opposition. What happened was that Odco Pty Ltd, which is the company which trades under the name Troubleshooters Available, joined several respondents in an action. It went ahead as an applicant and applied for an interim injunction and the court said, `No, you have not established the issues you have to establish'. Odco then applied for an interlocutory injunction. Before quoting from the judge who heard this case, may I just return to this matter of urgency where what it says blatantly-because it is a blatant thing-is that these are subcontractors; that there is no dispute about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has gone ahead today on the basis that there is no doubt that these people are subcontractors. There is no questioning of that; the assumption is made in the matter of urgency. There is no questioning there of that issue, that these people are not employees but are subcontractors. This is what the judge has to say on page 6 of his reasons for judgment:</PARA>
<PARA>Concerning the questions for trial which I have indicated there were substantial submissions each way. It was put on the respondents' behalf that the weakness of the applicant's case on the question whether the work was done in performance of a contract of employment should weigh heavily against the grant of interlocutory relief. My perception, on the evidence then filed-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, on the application for the interim injunction-</PARA>
<PARA>of the relative weakness of the applicant's case on that question had contributed to my refusing interim relief. </PARA>
<PARA>Why was that not brought up before it was said that these people are nothing if not subcontractors? The judge refused the application for an interim injunction but it is worse than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am accused of being selective. All right, let us read on in the judgment. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My perception, on the evidence then filed, of the relative weakness of the applicant's case on that question had contributed to my refusing interim relief. On the evidence now available it still seems to me not unlikely that most of the work will be held to have been done under contracts of employment by the builder. The circumstance that the building worker received nothing by way of remuneration directly from the builder does not preclude such a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>The judge then quotes the case of Howard and Wilson. The judge having said that, and that issue to be decided in a case starting on 3 November, honourable senators come into this chamber today and raise a matter of urgency which says that these people are `self-employed building trades subcontractors'. That is the very issue to be decided in the case beginning on 3 November. This Senate gets up at the end of the week and does not return until 1 November. To bring forward a matter of urgency containing as it does a statement which purports to be a matter of fact but which is a matter well in dispute is setting the Opposition's case on a ground of shifting sand at very high tide. </PARA>
<PARA> With the case still pending, the Opposition declares that there has been `victimisation and harassment'. That is another issue which the court must resolve. I will not comment on whether there was victimisation or harassment because that is a matter for the courts to decide. It is proper for me not to discuss it. However, I will say that this group-Troubleshooters Available-is certainly one-off in the Victorian building industry. The people who took proceedings on its behalf were Kroger and Kroger-a well known firm of solicitors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Stone; it is a very good firm. And I am very surprised that, having gone to Kroger and Kroger for a while, Troubleshooters Available should have changed its solicitors and given Kroger and Kroger away. We certainly want to know what that is about. I come to the next point concerning this great company! Troubleshooters Available refused to pay its premiums so that people could be covered by workers compensation. It refused to cover the people working for it. Troubleshooters Available refused to pay premiums and to ensure that its workers were protected against the very great injuries that can occur on a building site. It refused to pay, so what happened? The Accident Compensation Commission of Victoria had to take it to court. The Victorian Supreme Court told it to pay its premium. How does that square with the statement the Opposition has made about Troubleshooters Available? These are people who refused to pay premiums for workers compensation which meant their workers-if they were workers according to the courts-were not covered. To be fair, I must say that the court held that they were employees according to the Act; Mr Justice Gray held that they were employees under the deeming provisions of the Act. That is of limited use here, but it indicates that Troubleshooters Available is one of those employers who refuse to look after their workers properly and refused to pay their premiums.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> What are the fundamental issues in this matter of urgency? The first one is that the building industry in Victoria was in the doldrums and in chaos for years. On 8 October 1987 the Victorian building industry agreement was signed. Since August 1987-that is a couple of months prior to the agreement being signed; in the negotiations leading up to the signing of the agreement and in the time of the subsequent operation of that agreement-Victoria's share of the national time lost fell from a little below 30 per cent to 6 per cent in the nine months to April 1988. One of the central features of the agreement was the dispute settling procedure which Odco Pty Ltd-Troubleshooters Available-refused to abide by. There was then litigation which the Opposition has ignored today but which leaves open the very issues it presumes are facts in this matter of urgency. Honourable senators should remember that the unions themselves do not oppose body hire companies. There are some body hire companies with which they get along very well. I mention Skilled Engineering Pty Ltd, Kirby Engineering, and Engineering Installations Pty Ltd-companies which abide by the awards and understand that there are provisions which take care of people who work on building sites. People are threatened, as no other workers are threatened, because of the danger in that industry. These companies abide by the awards, pay premiums for people who work for them, give holiday pay, sick pay and all the facilities with which workers should be equipped when they work in that sort of industry. Troubleshooters Available does not give holiday pay, sick pay or rostered days off, and, until it was forced to do so by the court, did not insure its workers against fearsome injuries that occur on building sites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to present only briefly the Australian Democrats' comments on this urgency motion but it will be difficult to be brief. It is an extremely complex and controversial urgency motion. On the surface, when one initially examines the motion, it appears that it focuses upon yet another example of subcontractor versus union issues which have so typified the industrial relations scene in Australia. But it is much more than that. We suspect that it is a deliberately contrived test case to build upon, extend or update, if you like, the test cases in relation to sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act and to establish more recent and updated precedents. As Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets are becoming a little exhausted and are beginning to wear thin, it would seem that those on the extreme right in industrial relations politics need to update their precedents. We see this matter of urgency as a deliberately contrived exercise to do exactly that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Troubleshooters Available is doubtless happy to provoke unions as part of a broader campaign by some sections of the business community to break union power and to deregulate the labour system, which is totally in line with the philosophy expounded here at length by Senator Chaney and the Opposition in the recent discussion of the Industrial Relations Bill. Since the Opposition failed in its attempts to put in place its formula, it is now taking to the field and launching the battle and, in doing so, is calling into jeopardy the very judicial processes it would rely upon to sustain industrial relations in the future. </PARA>

This matter of urgency is so transparent that I am surprised the Opposition would bring it before the chamber within days of the industrial relations debate having closed. The best face that can be put upon Troubleshooters Available is that its service offers an opportunity for building workers who want to run their own small businesses. Unions do not view this process favourably because it potentially erodes awards and conditions and encourages employers to contrive their financial arrangements in such a way as to avoid on-cost loadings. It encourages employers to undertake arrangements which are totally unacceptable to the unions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ending by Senator McLean was a bit of a cream puff ending if we have ever seen one. The urgency motion which is before the Senate today relates to the seedy side of union power and its misuse. The issue outlined properly by Senator Short relates to a small business agency known as Troubleshooters Available which supplies self-employed subcontractors to building projects with labour shortages. It must be remembered that the building industry lends itself more than any other industry to subcontractors as there are a variety of different skills needed in this industry to complete projects. The agency is a vital service to the industry. The agency ensures greater flexibility and efficiency to the building industry. Therein lies the problem for the union organisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The building unions believe that these subcontractors will be harder to organise industrially and less likely to follow blindly the authority of the union organisers. To this end unions such as the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia (BWIU) have launched a campaign to destroy the Troubleshooters Available agency and the subcontractors on its books. As Senator Short pointed out, they have reverted to industrial blackmail, boycotts, graffiti by way of posters with swastikas on them and whatever method possible. We in Victoria are only too aware of the union thuggery in the building industry. Heaven knows we had to live with the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). Now it seems that the BWIU officials have taken up where the BLF left off, and with one aim in mind: to create a monopoly labour market on the building sites controlled, of course, by themselves. The irony is-if irony is the correct word-that these workers, the subcontractors, who belong to the agency actually belong to the union. It has become a case of a union bashing its own members. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should note that this case in Victoria has a wider implication affecting the rights of workers and small business throughout Australia-the rights to operate, to work freely and with a great deal of enterprise. The unions should be made aware that, as with the Dollar Sweets case and the Mudginberri case, those rights will be upheld in this Parliament and in the courts. On 8 September this year a successful stand was taken by Troubleshooters Available in the Federal courts against the two building unions in Victoria to stop them from harassing the subcontractors and forcing them from the commercial building sites. What is required and what this urgency motion is about is that this Government should start to take a strong stand in this ongoing industrial dispute. It should take a stand that supports the courts' rulings with a bit of action and supports the existence and operation of Troubleshooters Available. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be under absolutely no illusion at all as to the extent to which the trade unions will go to destroy Troubleshooters Available and the thousands of unionists on the agency's books. The unions, as we all know, have very powerful friends. They will call upon those powerful friends. Indeed, one is no less than the head of the Trades Hall Council in Victoria, John Halfpenny, that failed Senate candidate. John Halfpenny has a long record of disruptive and senseless union action in Victoria. He probably would consider the tactics of the building unions in Victoria very mild. Who can forget the strike he led in 1977 that threw Victoria into darkness and created great hardship? Over 10 years later the fact that he still leads by mob rule is shown by the orchestrated charge of workers against the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is clear that Troubleshooters Available and the subcontractors have no friends on the Victorian Trades Hall Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Troubleshooters and the subcontractors have no friends in the Victorian Government. Not only has this Government failed to support the basic rights of the agency and its workers but it has also allowed State Government authorities such as the Building Industry Long Service Leave Board to obstruct and harass the Troubleshooters agency. The Building Industry Long Service Leave Board has investigated the books of the Troubleshooters an incredible four times in six years. It should be remembered that this newly elected Victorian Government for the first time in the history of Victoria is now in the hands of a socialist left majority. This spells disaster not only for the building subcontractors but for all independent owners. We only have to look at the treatment the owners-operators in the trucking industry received at the hands of the State Government. Certainly this socialist left Government in Victoria is a firm ally of the Victorian Trades Hall Council and has backed up the building union bosses' efforts to squeeze the subcontractors out of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Troubleshooters can certainly expect no friends in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The whole concept of subcontractors within the building industry is in direct contrast to the grand vision of the ACTU to reconstruct Australia into 20 all-powerful unions. The whole concept of small business is in direct contrast to the ACTU's Australia Reconstructed. Its preferred option is for a corporate state led by big government and big business and, of course, super unions. Small business plays absolutely no part in its grand plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Opposition's back bench committee on industrial relations had to endure a two-hour speech from the President of the ACTU, Simon Crean, on the need for the Opposition to radically alter its industrial relations policy. The Opposition will not alter its policy. That policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> We will at all times encourage and preserve the rights of independent contractors, partners and self-employed persons. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very pertinent to the issue before the Senate today. We are about flexible markets and enterprise level wage negotiations; we are about the rights of workers and small business; and we are against the misuse of union power. The crux of our concern today is the defence of small business and the rights of the workers. Small business has always been at the cutting edge of industrial relations. It has always been the most significant reformer of our industrial relations system. As we all know, the celebrated Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets cases are landmark cases in industrial law and industrial relations. They are significant as they have been brought on by small business under the Trade Practices Act and the common law. It took the courage of small business and owner operators to stand up and instil some shred of justice into this country's industrial relations system. For that reason, militant unions should sense that the tide is running against them. They should be very mindful of the increased willingness of employers to seek redress through the common law or section 45d and section 45e of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to see that Troubleshooters Available is not alone in its fight against militant unions. The Australian Small Business Association (ASBA) has given its support to this case. ASBA News describes Troubleshooters Available as being `at the forefront' of a more general campaign `to restore the rights of subcontractors' and has pledged its `wholehearted support'. According to the Association, as Senator Short stated in this chamber, `subcontracting is under attack as never before in Australia'. Government and unions seem to be acting in a virtual conspiracy to squeeze subcontractors out of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber give our full support to ASBA's opinion and comments. We urge that the Government do likewise when it comes to voting on this urgency motion. It should be interested because, after all, in the building industry there are some 81,000 firms, over 90 per cent of which are classified as small business. Of those, 20,000 are located in my State of Victoria. Armed with this knowledge, one would hope that the Government would turn its attention to the rights and merits of this case. Instead, we hear Senator Cooney point out that it is improper to raise this matter while it is before the courts. That is absolute rubbish. It is the old legal bluff and bluster trick. We saw Senator McLean of the Australian Democrats back down very quickly from his original opinion that this matter may be sub judice. He backed down very quickly when he was challenged on that matter by Senator Chaney. His opinion went from a legal opinion to a very broad brush opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial peace in the building industry benefits the economy as a whole. Surely that must ring some bells for honourable senators on the other side of the chamber. The economy is now in a great mess. It has a debt burden of $115 billion, and we hear today that the monthly balance of payments figure is around the $1 billion mark. With the inflation rate at 7 per cent and rising, with foreign debt rising, and with short term interest rates at around 12 per cent and rising, Australia can hardly afford disruption in the building--</PARA>

This motion is squarely directed to an element of flexibility in the labour market. One of the reasons why this issue is important is that it goes to Australia's whole economic operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is disruption in the building industry it will be the Australian home buyer who suffers, particularly if the unions are successful in dismantling the subcontracting system. According to the Housing Industry Association Chief Executive, most people will not be able to afford new homes if government and unions continue to erode the efficiency of the housing industry's subcontracting system. This statement is backed up by statistics which show that Australia's home builders are probably the most efficient in the world. It is estimated that between 5.5 and 9.5 man hours are required to build one square metre of housing in Australia. Only the United States of America comes close to us, with a range of 6.5 to nine man hours. Does the Government really wish to place the family home further out of reach than it already is?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the same efficiency cannot be boasted in the commercial side of the building industry, where the use of subcontractors is not as prolific as in the housing industry. The commercial building industry problems have been borne out by the recent report of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the complexities of the building and construction industry. The report shows that, as most of us already know, the building industry is attuned to putting up buildings very quickly. In the words of the Arbitration Commission, cash flow seems to be the industry's guiding star. That is being very frank about the commercial side of the building industry. We should have no illusions; it is a very difficult industry. But there is one consistent factor in this industry: all the workers, from the builders' labourers to the subcontractors, want to work-and they want to maintain their right to work. I believe that I can speak from personal experience, having been a builders' labourer myself and having belonged to the Builders Labourers Federation. I know that the workers hold above any allegiance--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an urgency motion moved by Senator Short which begins with the words `The actions of building industry unions in Victoria, supported by the Victorian Labor Government' and continues on a fairly repetitious union bashing line. We in this chamber are used to debating matters of public importance and urgency motions which reflect issues which are current in the community. When we on this side of the chamber found out that this proposition was to come before the Senate this afternoon, we undertook an investigation to try to find out why it was to be put before us today. If we think back a few weeks, we recall that a series of matters of public importance came before the chamber which dealt with matters concerned with Victoria. Obviously, they were put forward as a political tactic leading to the Victorian State election, which has been and gone. In the preceding parliamentary session a series of matters came before the Senate which dealt with the constitutional referendum. Obviously they were a build-up to the referendum which was held on 3 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our investigations today, in going through the media-the print media, in the main-to find out why a motion such as this should be moved at this time, proved to be in vain. We could find no evidence of this, other than a reference in the Age newspaper of 13 September-well over a month ago. So we are still short of evidence-and that is not meant to be a pun. We still have no knowledge as to why this matter should be raised at this point in time. Is it just a continuation of the traditional tactics of those in the Opposition to bash the trade union movement? Having heard two Opposition speakers so far, that is the conclusion one is led to. I suspect there is somewhat more to it but at this stage perhaps I should give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt and I shall wait with bated breath to hear what Senator Chaney has to say. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time-I do not want to be unkind to Senator Short-perhaps he made the contribution to resurrect himself and to return to the front bench. Perhaps it was related to the two visitors in the gallery. And I recall some of the propaganda material sent to me on two occasions over the last couple of years. That probably has something to do with the company mentioned in the urgency motion before us. Maybe it is all coincidental. We shall wait and see. Hopefully what Senator Chaney has to say will indicate which is correct. We are still at somewhat of a loss. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say fairly early in my contribution to this debate that the legal implications of the Troubleshooters Available case are things that I am not prepared to canvass. Our Party did talk about this matter this morning and considered whether or not we ought to raise a point of order concerning the debate, but we decided that if we did that we could end up in a debate which would last the rest of the afternoon without necessarily resolving the issue, and we do have a log jam of legislation before the chamber. So we decided it was not the best course of action to take. I will not pursue that any more. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one point very strongly and clearly: I think honourable senators from all States and from all parties do have some obligations-in saying this I am not casting aspersions on any honourable senator in this place or or any arguments that have taken place-in that we should not ever seek to turn this place into a court of law. If we were to do that I could pick up another legal case in which the company is involved, this one not before the Supreme Court of Victoria but before the Federal Court of Australia, and canvass arguments concerning that under the privilege of Parliament-which would be unfair to all concerned: the defendants, the plaintiffs and so forth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that is so; I hope that is respected. We often go close, though in saying that I am not accusing Senator Chaney at all. As I have said, I have had some correspondence from the company involved. I would call it high-powered propaganda; it is very well presented. It is almost as good as some of the material that the Australian Labor Party produces from time to time and which others seek to copy. One always copies the best. It appears, going back to my industrial relations days, that Troubleshooters Available has one hell of a lot to learn about the industrial relations system and the people who practise within it in this country. It is obvious from the material I have read-that was some time ago and it is still back in Perth rather than here with me in Canberra; I was not inclined to have it faxed over at Government expense to review it, because I suppose Senator Walsh has had an influence on me-that this company has a lot to learn. It really needs to sit down and talk to the people in the trade union movement. By talking to only one side of the political spectrum it is being seriously misinformed on how to go about things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw an analogy with one of the companies Senator Cooney mentioned in his contribution to the debate, Skilled Engineering Pty Ltd. Maybe 10 years ago we could have conducted a similar debate about Skilled Engineering's attempts to get into the industry as a body-hire company-or as a carcass broker, which was the terminology we in the trade union movement used at that time. It sought to enter the industry by a variety of methods but it woke up to itself fairly quickly in the piece because it found out it was making very little progress. It was not going out and making money, making profits for itself and any shareholders it may have represented; all it was doing was creating confrontation-for the workers, the full time employees, on the job; for the people it hired; for the employers and so on. So it backed off and sat down and talked with the trade union movement. To the best of my knowledge Skilled Engineering is operating in every State in Australia and it is operating in a volatile industry-the metal trades industry. I do not want to compare the dispute statistics of one industry with those of another, but we know that the metal trades industry can, when it wants to pull on a turn, pull on a turn. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the name of John Halfpenny mentioned. It might surprise Senator McGauran to learn that Skilled Engineering was able to negotiate an agreement-and the agreement is still operating-with the union John Halfpenny used to represent before he was elected Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council. That company knows how to manage people, and it knows how to manage industrial relations. It has made it its business to know the operators in the industries in which it seeks to work, and from my isolated background of Western Australia I make the comment that I doubt whether the principals in Troubleshooters Available really have got to that stage. If they are the individuals in the gallery, I advise them to have a look at this matter. If they did talk not only with the employers but also with the unions they would never have put out the contract of employment document they have.

<PARA>If that is industrial relations in Australia in the twentieth century when we have a system of conciliation and arbitration, I will eat my hat.

From memory, at the time of the dispute Senator Short dealt with some facts. Today Senator Short, followed up by Senator McGauran, dealt with accusations and we were left very short on facts-apart from one poster which was held up and displayed but which we have all seen before because the company, Troubleshooters Available, sent it to me and I understand to all honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion of urgency brought forward by Senator Jim Short from Victoria on the subject of the lack of support from the Victorian Labor Government and from the Federal Labor Government for a firm which not just recently but for 10 years or more has been under very considerable pressure from the trade union movement, but which is endeavouring to preserve in the building industry some of the efficiencies that were in danger of being lost because of the attacks by the trade union movement on the subcontract system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be very easy to spend the whole of my quarter of an hour simply dealing with the random points which have been raised in response to this debate. But let me first of all go back to what this debate is really about. The matter has been brought forward by Senator Short on behalf of the Opposition because we believe that the pressures which for more than a decade have been put upon this firm are, in fact, attacks on individual freedom in this country. They are attacks on the rights of people to earn their living as they wish. That alone makes it a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps of more broad interest and importance to the Australian community, which tends not to be interested so much in theoretical ideas of freedom, is that we are talking about efficiency in the building industry and the cost at which people get the houses that they have to buy and the other buildings that they have to buy and occupy. I remind the Senate that the building and construction industry in Australia can be divided into two parts. There is that part which is concerned with building the houses in which Australians live. Most of us live in detached cottages. In that area of the building industry Australia is the most efficient country in the world. We build those buildings as efficiently as anywhere in the world and more efficiently than almost any other country. In Australia it takes between 5 1/2 and 9 1/2 man hours to build one square metre of housing; in the United Kingdom it takes 14 to 20 man hours; in Sweden it takes 11 to 12 man hours; and in the United States, which is the only country that comes close to us, it takes 6 1/2 to 9 man hours. That means that in a country which puts a high premium on home ownership and having a high standard of accommodation the building industry has been able to deliver. The Government, through its poor control of land availability, through its high tax policies, through its high interest rate policies, may put the cost of home ownership out of the hands of many Australians, but the fact is that the building industry does not. We have a very efficient building industry because it operates on a subcontract basis. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the building industry, the commercial building sector, Australia is a disgrace. The comparable figures show that Australia does very badly when we look at the way building is conducted around the world. If we look at some quite simple statistics that were produced by the master builders, now in their new building and construction organisation-they commissioned a work by Professor Ireland-we find a horrifying description of the building industry at that commercial end. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put it in terms that will make sense to every wage and salary earner in this country and to every building worker. Professor Ireland states that, if there was no lost time, workers on central business district sites could have their wages increased by 119 per cent and projects would cost no more. The record of stoppages is so bad that the wages that are being paid to the men who work on the sites could be more than doubled and it would not add to the cost of the building. Last year Mr Kelty said that the building industry was bad everywhere in the world. In Australia, according to this survey, 17 per cent of working time on central business district building projects was lost because of industrial disputes. In the United States and in the United Kingdom, the figure was closer to zero than to one per cent. In Australia we lost 10 per cent of time because of inclement weather. What is the situation in the United States and in the United Kingdom? It is somewhere around 2 per cent. Is that not remarkable? In other words, in a country with the extraordinarily favourable climatic conditions of Australia, we lose five times as much working time on building sites because of inclement weather as they do in the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a threat by the building unions over a decade or more to try to make that bad section of the industry worse. It is part of the push. We heard it today from Senator McKiernan, who, with horror, incorporated a standard form of contract into the Hansard. Yet we know that the working men and women of Australia can afford, in the main, decent housing because we have efficient building practices and not the inefficiencies which are imposed on the industry by the building unions in the commercial market. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a struggle which affects every Australian. The truth of the matter is that the Government of Victoria and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia have refused to take any interest in the pressure which the building unions have put upon this organisation, even though the rights of the Australian people, the economic interests of the Australian people, are being threatened by the pressure against subcontracting generally as a feature of the union movement today. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sick of it. When I rise to debate in this place an issue that touches trade unions, inevitably the lawyers who have made their money out of the trade unions, such as Senator Cooney, and the people who have been trade union officials, such as Senator McKiernan and the next Labor speaker, Senator Childs, will get up and accuse us of union bashing. I just want to say, when we talk about the less savoury end of the trade union movement, that I, in this place and elsewhere, have praised unions such as the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia which is trying to take the vehicle building industry into the twenty-first century. I have praised the changes in the metal workers unions that are looking at award restructuring and doing constructive things. But I make no apology, like Senator Short, for bringing into this place those instances of trade union abuse of power. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short talked about the Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd. We got criticised for dealing with matters which were sub judice. Let me deal with the case of Dollar Sweets which is not sub judice any more because it has been through the courts. Let me remind the Senate, and Senator Childs who will follow me in this debate, that that case was also about the oppression of workers by other workers and not just an attack on a small businessman and an employer. Let me read from the judgment of the Victorian Supreme Court about some of the things that were uncovered in that dispute. There was an incident involving drivers which ceased when Mr Lendon contacted the police. The judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA> A fortnight after . . . as Mr Lendon was delivering sugar to the plaintiff's premises-</PARA>
<PARA>a truck driver delivering sugar-</PARA>
<PARA>he was obliged to stop his vehicle because of the presence of another vehicle . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We then get a description of the pickets. The judgment continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the second defendant came to Mr Lendon's truck and attempted to pull the side mirror off the truck. Mr Lendon began to get out of his truck and while doing so the third-named defendant, Jacques Lahausse, punched him from behind with the consequence that he fell to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Then a number of women who were in the picket line punched and kicked Mr. Lendon. The fourth-named defendant . . . ripped a hair piece from his head, which he said caused him to bleed. Mr. Lendon could not break free from his assailants until two other truck drivers came to his assistance. The uncontradicted evidence is that Mr. Lendon has, as a result of the assault, been required to have an operation on the retina of his eye, and now wears glasses. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to go on with other examples from Canberra of the same sort of brutality and oppression. I just say to the Senate that the Australian Labor Party and honourable senators opposite do themselves less than justice when they refuse to acknowledge that there is an ugly side to trade unions and industrial disputes. Those of us who are prepared to acknowledge the virtues of the trade union movement when they exist are entitled to bring forward abuses when they exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney attempted to say that we should not be debating this matter because it is sub judice. I make the point that the difficulties that we debate in this place are difficulties that have been going on to a greater or lesser extent-the situation has come and gone-for 15 years, back to 1973. Senator McKiernan has asked why this urgency motion was brought forward today. I will tell him why it was brought forward today. When Senator Short asked me whether he could bring it forward at the very beginning of the session I said no, that we had other matters to debate and he would have to wait until later in the session. He has been pressing me ever since. Only early this week did I say, `All right, you can have a go'. That is the secret of the timing of this matter! Senator Cooney should be more careful when he comes in here and chastises the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> He accused Troubleshooters Available, under parliamentary privilege, of not paying WorkCare-a very serious accusation which goes to the agency's credit and its reputation in the community. Yet my understanding is that this matter has been litigated in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has held that these people are not employees. Final orders have not yet been made and discussions are still to be had with the WorkCare authorities. But the fact is that these people are not common law employees, although some could be caught by the deeming provisions of the WorkCare legislation. So let us have a little more care on the other side of the chamber as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Senator McLean who, sadly, once again when it comes to the crunch, has, as always, run with the Left. He claimed that this was of concern to the extreme Right; that it was only a first case; that we were dealing with the question of the subcontractor versus the union approach to things; and that it was part of some deliberate campaign. I say in response to Senator McLean that this sort of behaviour has been going on since 1973. There have been attempts to provide avenues of work for people who do not want to be regarded as employees, who wish to carry on businesses on their own behalf and who wish to contribute to the flexibility, efficiency and productivity of the building industry in Australia. When we get an obstruction of those efforts over a 15-year period I find that it strains my credulity to suggest that, in some peculiar way, debating that matter in this Senate in October 1988 is in some way a plot. It is an absurd response from Senator McLean and I am disappointed that he should make that point. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate is about union power versus worker power. The subcontractors who work for Troubleshooters are all paid above award wages and, indeed, are all union members. I might say that that muddies the stream. Because of the pressures that can be put on people in the building industry they have accepted that all of them, whether they are independent subcontractors or not, have to be members of a union, so they are all paying union dues. Troubleshooters is not being attacked here; it is the 7,000 union members who, over the years, have obtained work through this agency as independent subcontractors. The real reason the building unions dislike the subcontracting system is quite clear. Their advocate at the building industry inquiry being conducted by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said that the unions' opposition to the system was because it `promoted individualism and competition where they really wanted solidarity to the organisation'. This matter is about solidarity to organisations and not about individual rights, competition, or individualism. That is the quality that we need if we are to reverse the long term slide of this country-we want individual effort and competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I ask the Senate to compare the efficiency of our home building sector, which has that competition, with the gross inefficiency, waste and abuse which occur in the commercial building sector and which led this Labor Government to have the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) deregistered. The abuses were so bad that the Labor governments of Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney at the time combined to deregister the BLF. The benefits of that contract system were put by Commissioner Burns in the 1979 report of the New South Wales Enquiry into the Cottage Industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not because of any reverence for those two concepts of `free enterprise' and `the marketplace' that I am convinced that the present practice in the cottage building industry should be left alone. It is because they so obviously work. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has taken to talking about a flexible labour market. The type of set-up that Troubleshooters represents is at the cutting edge of greater labour market flexibility all around the world. Yet here we have the unions and a Labor government working to undermine this flexibility-not in the interests of protecting workers but in the interests of protecting the power of the union officials in the building industry. This has been written about in the Age and in the Business Review Weekly, without people crying out that it is a matter which is sub judice. The truth of the matter is that in this debate the sub judice argument was used to try to obscure the real interests of the Australian people that are dealt with in the urgency motion brought forward by Senator Short. I commend it to the Senate. I fear that the Australian Democrats will run with the Labor Party on this. It is a disgrace when we think of their claim that they look to the interests of small business in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The urgency motion brought forward by the Opposition talks of `the necessity for the Hawke Government to take urgent action to assist in preventing further disruption' in the Victorian building industry. What are the facts? As Senator Cooney has already established, the facts are that, normally, we should not be discussing the issue as it is to be dealt with by the Federal Court of Australia. But I heard an interjection from Senator Stone to the effect that Troubleshooters Available cannot get justice from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Two Opposition senators, Senator McGauran and Senator Short, referred to another legal case where there is a damages action against Troubleshooters Available which is to be heard before a jury in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The Opposition has been free in talking about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the debate should take place because it highlights the difference between the Opposition and the Government. The Opposition has picked Troubleshooters Available because it seems to conform with the extremist industrial relations policy of the Liberal Party of Australia. The Opposition is attracted to it because it is an award breaker, undermining the long established industrial standards. This is a characteristic of the Troubleshooters Available industrial sham-and that is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Victoria has a thriving building industry, nurtured by the Cain Government, this Opposition wants us to leap back into the past and back a company that wants to suck profits from the building industry and give nothing in return. In contrast, this Government, as the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, says, has award restructuring as the central plank of the program of labour market reform, as set out in a paper released with the Budget last August. It rejects the simplistic and unworkable deregulation philosophy of the Opposition and presents a cooperative approach to industrial relations reform and workplace change. The choice is clear. It is cooperation or confrontation. That is the answer to what Senator Chaney has just said. The choice is building skills in the building industry, restructuring, creating secure conditions to achieve change and a shared benefit of increased productivity, or the reverse-anarchy. This proposal coming from the Opposition points very much in the direction of anarchy. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions of contract that Troubleshooters Available requires its workers to sign show it to be a feral industrial enterprise. It is a tough industry, but Troubleshooters is like a feral organisation within the industry. Senator Chaney referred to the less savoury aspects of the trade union movement. I say that the activities of Troubleshooters are a less savoury activity of employers. The worker-and I emphasise the worker-who signs the document, signs away rights. The worker who signs the document is purported to be self-employed, as is indicated in Senator Short's motion. But if one looks at clause 6 of the document that Senator McKiernan has incorporated, one sees that all that happens is that the worker takes an hourly rate that is higher but loses a whole range of award entitlements, and that is what it is all about. For example, clause 7 of the agreement to the contract, which I previously referred to, states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is agreed that I (the undersigned) must carry out all work that I agree to do with the agency Troubleshooters Available in a workmanlike manner and Troubleshooters Available is thereby guaranteed against faulty workmanship. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>All work must be made good. Further, I agree to cover the work (where necessary) for Public Liability, Accident Insurance, Long Service Leave, Holiday Pay, sick Pay and superannuation, and have no claims on Troubleshooters Available in respect of the above. </PARA>
<PARA>All risks and liability are with the worker. Workers are only paid, of course, for time worked-the other significant undermining of the award conditions in the building industry. But of course they are not self-employed, and that is the important thing. I believe the court case that is projected will establish that. That is the important point about it. The workers have none of the characteristics of a genuine person running a small business. Generally speaking, they work under the direction of a foreman as any other time worker does. They do not tender for a job. There is no negotiation about the price for the work they will do, as would be the case in a genuine business. There is no business relationship. They have no overheads. Other than the flat rate they receive there is no question of profit or loss. All these normal business criteria are absent because we are talking about a phony self-employment, and I assert that. I believe the trade union movement clearly asserts it. I believe the courts will come to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have Senator Chaney saying that there is need for flexibility of the labour movement, what we are really dealing with is an attempt to take away all the infrastructure of the award by virtue of a simple higher payment being made. Of course there will always be workers who will take a narrow view of the condition in the industry, until they are hurt because of their opting out of the general conditions of the award that are designed to protect all the workers in the industry. That is the situation that we face. It has been said that Troubleshooters has made representations. We know it has had a highly placed publicity campaign, but I am informed that, despite what Senator Chaney has just said, at no stage has the company put specific proposals to the Government. The principals of the company have only relayed their concern to relevant departmental officers. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Commonwealth Government cannot do anything in this situation. It is a Victorian jurisdiction. The matter is confined to Victoria. Clearly this is a red herring because of Liberal Party industrial philosophy. One of the major concerns of the unions, as I understand it, relates to the employment relationships created by the operations of Troubleshooters, which avoid the application of awards, agreements, industrial legislation and create a special class of worker. That it what we are talking about-a special class of worker. The conflict created on site by this duality is a major source of conflict in Victoria. An attempt is being made to create a special class of worker. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Victorian Trades Hall Council are leading this struggle against the breakdown of building industry conditions? They are not opposed to the legitimate companies that engage in labour-only forms of contract, because they conform to all the award requirements. If people need additional workers for a concrete pour, companies enter into contracts, but they pay all the award conditions. That is the qualitative difference between those companies, such as Skilled Engineering Pty Ltd, to name one, and the company that is being referred to today. I believe that if business, government and trade unions-indeed, everyone-wants an orderly award structure, predictability so that long term investment and planning can be made, cooperation to restructure complex industries like the building industry, apprenticeship creation-and, remember, these is no apprenticeship creation with this type of company-and the upgrading of skills, we will reject this type of time bomb that this company is trying to introduce into industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Guy Fawkeses in the Opposition are very keen on having this matter blow up to give them the confrontation that fits in with their philosophy. I think Senator McLean has put their weights up. He pointed out that they are thwarted by their moves in the recent industrial legislation, so they now continue with the famous voluntary agreements clauses 5.9 and 5.10 of their industrial relations policy and their obsession with voluntary agreements. I cannot spend as much time as I would like to on that matter and, as I say, we have just gone through that debate. We have new legislation that provides a framework to overcome even the sort of thing that Senator Chaney referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have change and improvements in such a difficult industry as the building industry, we will only get it by cooperation. We will not get cooperation from the vast majority of people in the industry if we promote a company that is only concerned with taking money out of the building industry. That is all a company does when, by paying a higher rate of pay, it tries to buy off all the other conditions of the award. A company does not put into the industry when it is doing that. All it does is pay a high over-award payment and it then tries to abrogate all the award conditions that the workers would normally enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran quoted the Australian Small Business Association as being in the forefront of the campaign. That gives away the New Right aspect of the campaign that we have in this case. Senator McGauran referred to the 20,000 companies that should be concerned in Victoria. I would say to all those small business people, `Watch very carefully for an industrial relations policy that can only inflame the whole of an industry'-in this case, a very significant industry, the building industry. All small business people who rely on the building industry have a guarantee of confrontation if this proposal is extended. In other words, this will be the position if we are not successful in saying that workers in this situation as proposed are being misled. We must say that we do want an industry in which there is proper consideration of the infrastructure, where employers, as part of their responsibility to the industry, contribute to building the considerations that are necessary for the prosperity of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, I think, is very proud of the way that we have cooperation in industry after industry. We have the cooperation that has been expressed in industry plans in industry after industry. Although the building industry will be a very difficult industry to reconcile because of its very history, the reconciliation will only come about if there is goodwill, if we are not seeking to have confrontation which is disguised under the Liberal Party's slogan of individualism. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, in the conclusion of his remarks, referred to the problems of pickets. I suggest to the honourable senator that if he takes the overall position of industrial relations in Australia-indeed, if he takes the industrial relations position in Victoria, since we came to government-he will see that there has been a vast reduction in industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is another side I would like to express in the remaining minute or two that I have to speak. It has been my experience, and I know it continues to this day, that people are tramped from jobs every day by employers using all sorts of subtle techniques for getting rid of people who are either outspoken or not liked for one reason or another. I am referring to all sorts of people-creative people and dynamic people who have dared to differ from the strong discipline that exists in many factories, plants and building sites. So there is another side which I have not time to develop here but I challenge Senator Chaney: I believe I could produce, given time, thousands of cases where ordinary people are hurt because of the action of employers. They have only their unions to defend them. Senator Chaney has to come in here time and time again with the Dollar Sweets case and a couple of other cases. They are part of the New Right agenda. They do not prove anything, because the majority of people-unfortunately, ordinary people working in industry-have great difficulty and very little democracy. That is something this Government is seeking to change in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I have just a few minutes at my disposal before the time for this debate expires. I do not want to go over all the issues that have been dealt with in the debate today. I thank participants in the debate, and in particular my colleagues Senator Julian McGauran and Senator Chaney, my Leader in the Senate, for their very significant contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will comment on a couple of the points that have been raised by speakers on the other side-in particular, Senators Cooney, McKiernan and Childs-and also pick up a couple of points made by Senator McLean for the Australian Democrats. Both Senator Cooney and Senator McLean claimed that we on this side were bringing in the matter for some type of clandestine reason shortly before a trade practices action which is being brought by Troubleshooters Available against two of the building industry unions is dealt with in the courts on 3 November. That is complete nonsense. As Senator Chaney has explained, the timing of today's debate is one of programming within our own ranks. </PARA>
<PARA> But the point I do want to make briefly is that Senator Cooney claims that the action to be brought in the courts on 3 November is really all about what we have been debating today. My understanding-I stand to be corrected-is that that is not correct. The section 45d action that is being debated and being brought forward by Troubleshooters on 3 November relates to four specific incidents in which unions, through organisers, have been in the past on building sites and have closed or threatened closure of the sites if Troubleshooters people were not removed from the sites. There is an action for damages by Troubleshooters but there is also the section 45d action which, as I understand it, seeks a permanent injunction to prevent further similar practices occurring. I do not believe that in any way the debate we have initiated in the Senate today touches on that. Senator McKiernan was critical of the proprietors of Troubleshooters in terms of their industrial relations. He made some very harsh comments about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote briefly to the Senate some remarks by one of the proprietors of Troubleshooters, Mr Brian Groves, to an industrial relations group meeting several months ago. I ask listeners to judge whether these are the words of a person who is not deeply concerned about industrial relations in this country and about the need for employers, employees and management-for all concerned-to work together in a common cause. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The inevitability of the failure of management in this country to address the real issues that cause industrial and economic havoc... </PARA>
<PARA>He said these have become very clear as he listened to various employer representatives at this seminar. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The right and the left have their separate interests to represent to be sure, but until the self-righteous breast beating on both sides stops, this potentially great country is the loser. Until Australians dismiss self-interest and concentrate on principles that benefit all, there will be no solution to this country's predicament. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on subsequently to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Managers and workers each have their job to do and together they can solve this country's industrial relations problems. I may sound like an idealist, but I have a working model and I know that it works. </PARA>
<PARA>So said Mr Groves. He has a pretty good track record to prove that, as has Troubleshooters. As Senator Chaney mentioned, it has caused the employment in the building industry of 7,000 subcontractors-independent small businessmen-during the years in which it has been in operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cooney made comments about the Work Care situation confronting Troubleshooters. In my view, he misled the Senate in what he said. He claimed that the Troubleshooters had been found by the courts to have been employers of the subcontractors. That is not correct. The Supreme Court has found and has given the reasons, although final orders have not yet been given, that the Troubleshooters' clients who are placed on building sites work neither for the agency nor for the builders who hire them temporarily. </PARA>
<PARA> Time prevents me from going any further on this matter, Madam Acting Deputy President. I commend this urgency motion to the Senate. It is about the right of the average Australian who wants to be independent to remain independent, to have a job. It is about the power of the unions to prevent this and it is about the interests of this country in preventing that happening. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to put in place the Commonwealth's general revenue assistance arrangements with the States and the Northern Territory for 1988-89, following the expiry of the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1985. In conjunction with the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill 1988, it implements the arrangements agreed to at the May 1988 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting in respect of the Commonwealth's general purpose payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The payments provided for in this Bill, $12,400.6m, account for about 15 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1988-89. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In combination with the general purpose capital assistance provided for under the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill 1988 and the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. The level of assistance provided in the Bill involves a reduction of $650m against the forward estimates at the time of the Premiers Conference. The base funding that was agreed at the Conference is to be adjusted for the actual increase in the CPI in the year to the March quarter 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> General revenue assistance to be provided in  1988-89 will also be reduced so as to recoup 90 per cent of the revenue available to the States and the Northern Territory as a result of the removal of the payroll tax exemption for Commonwealth Government business enterprises. In 1988-89 it is estimated that the additional savings to the Commonwealth from this measure will be $179m. However, because the States will retain 10 per cent of the additional collections, the net effect of this measure will be to enhance their fiscal capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Adjusted for the payroll tax recoupment and the new hospital funding arrangements that were also agreed to at the Premiers Conference, general purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory-comprising the general revenue assistance provided for in this Bill plus general purpose capital payments-are estimated to decline by 4.6 per cent in real terms in 1988-89. This compares with a reduction in payments last year contributed toward the fiscal restraint exercised by the State and local government sector in 1987-88. The restraint is welcomed. As the Commonwealth has emphasised at both the 1987 and 1988 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings, it is essential that all levels of government restrain their spending and borrowing in order to restrain domestic demand, reduce the call on domestic savings and arrest the build up in foreign debt. The level of payments provided for in this Bill will ensure that the budgetary policies of State governments continue to complement the Commonwealth's fiscal strategy in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning briefly to some of the details, the major part of the general revenue assistance to be provided under this Bill is to be paid as financial assistance grants, which are currently estimated to total $12,313.2m. Before account is taken of the payroll tax adjustment, the distribution of these financial assistance grants is to be determined in line with per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its 1988 Report on General Revenue Grant Relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The relativities adopted apply to a combined pool of general revenue assistance and hospital grants. By using these relativities, no State is advantaged or disadvantaged relative to other States because of the altered distribution of hospital funding grants to apply from 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for part of general revenue assistance to be provided to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory as special revenue assistance, estimated at $87.4m. </PARA>
<PARA> This is also to be adjusted in line with the actual CPI increase in the year to the March quarter 1989. This assistance is intended to ease the adjustment for those governments to the reduced level of funding and the new relativities adopted at the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> In most other respects, the arrangements provided for in the Bill are similar to those applying in the triennium completed in 1987-88. The main differences are that the arrangements proposed for 1988-89:</PARA>
<PARA> Encompass the Northern Territory on the same basis as the States;</PARA>
<PARA> Apply for a single year rather than a triennium;</PARA>
<PARA> No longer include a component for (general purpose) identified health grants, which instead are being provided as a specific purpose payment under new hospital funding arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA> Make provision for the Commonwealth to reduce general revenue assistance payments to any State or States if they were to exceed their 1988-89 global borrowing limits. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill forms an important part of the Commonwealth's endeavours to continue public sector restraint at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the report on proposed changes to the southern bluefin tuna fishery management plan by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology there has emerged the resolution of an issue of equity produced by Labor Government actions and corrected only because of Senate response.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brian Archer, from Tasmania, who worked always towards the negotiated solution which has finally emerged. My appreciation also goes to my colleagues-the Chairman, the other members of the Committee-and to our efficient Committee secretariat for the part they played. The problem facing Australian fishing is complex and critical. The fishery is under immediate and urgent threat. The stock has been overfished. The biomass is at a critically low level. Fishing by Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese and by fishermen from other nations has produced the crisis. I think all members of the Committee accept and support the need for concerted action to reduce fishing for southern bluefin tuna as a matter of urgency if the fishery is to survive at all. What we have considered in this Committee's reference is a different matter: the fairness of the arrangements, the equity, regarding where the fishing restrictions will fall. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) had proposed, as part of his solution, that certain fishermen, many of them from my State of New South Wales, now fishing for small amounts of tuna should have those rights removed as part of his new management plan. His officers were quite unable to justify such an approach when questioned, although they did lay out the dangers they saw in the entry of new fishermen to the fishing of southern bluefin tuna.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the end we were able to negotiate with the Minister. We support the move to limit catches of southern bluefin tuna. We share the sense of urgency which the Minister and his officers transmitted to us. We share the sense of urgency which the situation demands of all honourable senators. We share and support the Minister's decision to require all those who hold quota to limit their fishing in line with the new overall fishing limits which are to be laid down. But we were not satisfied with the arrangements as they related to certain fishermen who traditionally have taken small amounts of bluefin tuna and who have reported those catches properly on the prescribed forms as laid down by the regulations. We insisted, and the Minister finally agreed, that the small fishermen operating within special quota entitlements should not have part of their livelihood removed. It was a matter of some convenience that we had a disallowance motion in the Senate up our sleeves, in reserve. I must say that that helped in the negotiations no end. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about the small fishermen, many from the south coast of New South Wales, who fish only occasionally for southern bluefin tuna and who do so legally. They saw no justice in yet one more move by the Labor Government to disadvantage them in a way which was not equitable. We agreed that there had to be a great reduction in the activity within the fishery. We agreed that only those who had been fishing for southern bluefin tuna, who had a history of having fished for southern bluefin tuna, should have a quota in this new crisis and this new emergency. What was worrying the Minister was that, under the regulations as they existed, up to, I think, a couple of thousand fishermen could have entered, even if they had never fished for southern bluefin tuna. Those fishermen did not face a loss of livelihood. It is not as if they had been taking the tuna and were faced with the loss of that catch. They would have been new entrants. The Committee agreed that those new entrants were not welcome in view of the critical position facing the fishery and the biomass of southern bluefin tuna. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to the credit of the Minister that he has been prepared to deal with the Senate Committee, armed as it was with a contingent notice to disallow his regulation. Nevertheless, he dealt with the Committee and we were able to reach a negotiated solution. That solution will mean that certain fishermen in the small fishing ports along the south coast of New South Wales, fishermen who have taken southern bluefin tuna, who have reported their catches, who are known to the Department and who have an established record will now share in the smaller quota. They will be able to take small amounts of tuna, as they have done. They will be able to report then, as they have done. They will pay the licence fees, as they have done. They, too, will be allowed to continue their activity. I think that is a fairer solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the reason that prompted the Minister to deal with us, I think we have to thank him. We have a solution which will allow the Minister to pursue the protection of the fishery as he wants to do. It will allow all those who hold quota to continue to fish, albeit with smaller quotas than they have enjoyed until now. We have delivered to many small fishermen, particularly on the east coast, who otherwise would have suffered unnecessarily and unfairly, a much fairer set of arrangements than those originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of those committee references which reflect well upon the Senate. I remind honourable senators that the reference was accepted by the Committee only three or four weeks ago and it was dealt with expeditiously. It was possible to hold one major public hearing and several private hearings with officers and with the Minister. It was possible to report to the Senate and to bring to the Senate a resolution of the problem. It is the way in which Senate committees should work. Again, I want to say to the secretariat and to my colleagues on the Committee that I think it reflects well upon the whole Senate committee system. I am delighted with the report but most especially delighted with the outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 12 April 1988 when the fisheries notices relative to the curtailment of southern bluefin tuna fishing were signed with the effect of removing all the rights to fish for southern bluefin tuna by all those who had previously had entitlements to catch either one tonne or five tonne quotas under the original southern bluefin tuna management plan of 1985. Between 12 April 1988 and June 1988 considerable discussion and negotiation took place. The result was that those to be divested claimed that they had been treated unfairly. There was never any question that the total catch of southern bluefin tuna had to be reduced. We all agreed on that and we agreed that it should be done drastically. The question was whether cuts should be made to all those with licences. As my colleague Senator Peter Baume has already said, we discussed the question of equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It became clear early on that information was available to the scientists that was not known to the fishermen, that the Australian Fisheries Service had plans that also needed to be spelt out fully to both the fishermen and the scientists, and that the fishermen and State interests wanted to be heard and wanted to know what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The notices of disallowance were given in the Senate on our return to the Senate on 23 and 24 August. We then proceeded to arrange a meeting to hear the evidence. The evidence was provided and resulted in the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, settling on two issues: firstly, that huge cuts in the catching quota were absolutely essential if the fishery were to survive; and, secondly, that they should be borne by all those who were participating in it. The Committee acknowledged that the original arrangements had been very loose but that they had been necessary as a means of getting a closure to the original agreement in 1985. After meeting with the Australian Fisheries Service representatives for a second time the Committee then met with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and put to him the proposal that he ultimately approved. I thank him publicly for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The handling of the problem was a most successful operation and gave all the parties the opportunity to understand one another and to remember that at all times it is the resource that must be preserved. The concurrent negotiations over international catches established the seriousness, and the comments of Dr Harden-Jones that the only safe catch is a zero catch brought everybody up with a severe jerk. The solution provides that every fisherman in Australia who has a record of commitment to catching southern bluefin tuna since the plan was instituted in 1985 and who has a licence or an entitlement will still be able to fish for southern bluefin tuna. The simple evidence to be produced will be the CR.2 form and that is the entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> What else came from the inquiry was that there is still dangerously little current knowledge of the southern bluefin tuna, its travels, breeding and habits and that much more research in this area is absolutely essential. It further arose that State fishing authorities or cooperatives, if they owned or leased a quota, could cover any of their members who produced a genuine incidental, untargeted catch. Hopefully, we have not only fairly and equitably resolved the issue but gained an understanding of the problems of this and other areas of the fishing industry that may prevent other similar problems in the future. I thank the other members of the Committee and the Committee staff for the way they carried out their jobs. I also thank all the witnesses who came from various parts of Australia to appear before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Archer and Senator Peter Baume, I too want to record my thanks to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in developing its report, Proposed Changes to the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan. I want to specifically mention the work of Senator Childs, the Chairman of the Committee. As I have said on previous occasions, a lot of responsibility rests with an individual senator when he holds the position of chair. That person must coordinate and ensure that all the interests in whatever area the Committee is covering are represented and given a fair hearing. Senator Childs certainly did that and I am sure that my colleagues would join me in commending him on his work. Mention was made of the staff of the Committee, who put in a tremendous effort in a very short space of time to bring the report, Proposed Changes to the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan, to the point that it is now at. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), despite some of the comments Senator Peter Baume made about him and the actions that the Government undertook in the initial stages prior to the inquiry, did cooperate in every way with the Committee in reaching what seems to the Committee at least and certainly, I would suggest, to a large number of witnesses who appeared before the hearing, to be a satisfactory settlement to a very difficult problem. It is a problem that concerns not only the individual fisherpersons. A lot of people make their living from catching fish, but this report and the actions of the Minister on southern bluefin tuna go much wider than that. As Senator Peter Baume and Senator Archer have said, the stock of this particular species is in some jeopardy. If the Government had not instituted some action we could in a very short space of time have seen the complete depletion of the southern bluefin tuna.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Evidence was given to the Committee about the catch and how it had escalated over the years leading to a peak in the mid-1970s. Because the stock was overfished it started on a rapid and massive decline. While that decline in the catch was happening the price of the product was actually increasing. We had evidence given to us that one fish brought to one witness $50,000. This was to satisfy the Japanese sashimi market. That in itself is an attraction for many individuals to enter the field, a field that has declining stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government obviously had to take some action. The action that was contemplated in the first instance of not allowing a quota for those holders of five-tonne and one tonne quotas was deemed by some to be inequitable. I might say as a senator from Western Australia that the Committee, together with the Minister, has come up with a recommendation and a solution that will please the Western Australian industry and Western Australian Government. They advocated to us that when cutting quotas we ought to cut them right across the board. That is indeed what we have attempted to do. Whilst we have reached a compromise solution on this occasion, a lot more investigation has to be done into this particular aspect of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard evidence that the stock is declining. We also had heard that there was insufficient evidence available-Senator Archer went into that matter in some detail-about stock and breeding grounds. There is some confusion within scientific circles in the industry. The particular species of fish will have to be continually looked at by government and by all connected with the industry if a catastrophe is not to occur through the wiping out of the species. The Committee has done a very good job under some pressure not only from industry but also from government and a number of vested interests. The vested interests comprise not only the people who are interested in the money that can be earned from the industry but also people who are interested in nature and the protection of a species of fish that has as much right to exist on this earth as honourable senators do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a zero option for everybody. I stress the observation that both the Government and the Opposition are committed to a form of growth economics which demands that we have more people who demand more from the environment and that as a consequence the equit- able share of what is left becomes smaller and smaller. What we see in the case of the southern bluefin tuna is simply one of many examples of the failure of the basic growth economic model which both the Government and Opposition are following. As Senator McKiernan has pointed out, as the stock declines the value of each individual fish goes up. So, the market system which the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Senator Button and Senator Walsh extol every day in their respective Houses of parliament does nothing whatsoever to protect the environment and the stocks of fish. I draw attention to clause 1.4 of the report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee itself is very concerned that not only is the existence of an economically important fishery threatened, but that the very existence of this particular tuna species is in doubt. The species has in the past been over-fished and immature fish have been taken. Further substantial cuts in total allow- able catch may be needed if stocks are going to be rebuilt. </PARA>
<PARA>Three factors have led to that situation. We are dealing with a migratory species, which means that we do not have complete control over stocks. The fish migrate very extensively and are fished by a number of nations. Some of those nations in the past have shown very little regard for environmental care. Japan is one nation which proceeded to fish the various whale species long after the International Whaling Commission had recommended substantial cuts, and the Japanese have not shown themselves to be particularly concerned about environmental matters generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The tuna fish is a species that lives for quite a long time-up to 20 years-but interestingly, and this was not known when the fishery first began in Australia, it is often eight years old before it gets to a size at which it can breed. In the early days of fishing the tuna stocks in South Australia we, along with many other countries, were taking immature species. That is one of the factors which have very significantly depleted the breeding stocks of this fish. Bernie Scott, the manager of the tuna branch of the Australian Fisheries Service, says in a paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent scientific advice indicates that the stock is in greater danger than we had first thought. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 it was estimated that the parental biomass-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the number of fish over eight years old and of the breeding age-</PARA>
<PARA>had fallen to about one-third of its pre-fishing level. Now scientists believe it could be as low as one-fifth of the 1960 level and are predicting a further reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It hasn't yet been determined whether recruitment failure has occurred-that is, such a severe reduction in the production of young fish that the stock may be unable to replenish itself-but with such a dramatic fall in the parental biomass the risk of this is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a risk which has to be minimised if a commercially viable fishery is to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Scientists have advised that we may also have to consider a further reduction in the total allowable catch. </PARA>
<PARA>He is clearly presaging a total wipe-out of this species. It is important, of course, to recognise these matters of equity, but there is an even more important underlying lesson to be learned; that is, that the growth model of the economy which says that we can have more people demanding more from the environment is simply not sustainable. This is just one example of it. It is a model which has to be rejected, which has to be turned around. The Australian Democrats would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators the model of a sustainable economy. A steady state economy which is sustainable in the long term is the only economic model that will lead us to a solution of this and many other similar problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say from the outset that I find it decidedly disturbing that the Australian Democrats, and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines) in particular, would suggest to the Standing Committee on Procedure that we introduce into this chamber by way of a standing order the prospect of having the gag put without debate. I well remember Senator Don Chipp, as he then was, saying ever so often that he was here as a reasonable man to hear reasonable argument and to keep others honest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder how the Democrats propose to weigh in the balance the arguments put by one side or another in respect of the suspension of standing orders when they do not know the arguments in favour of the suspension. Somebody on our side, such as Senator Peter Baume, might well have a compelling reason for seeking the suspension of standing orders. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume quite properly interjects, it would be certain to be compelling. But Senator Haines suggests that the suspension of standing orders ought not be debated, and that would deny him the opportunity to put his reasons. If this chamber is to function as a living, real chamber, it is imperative that people's arguments be put in a proper way. Argument ought to be put for the suspension of standing orders. If it is the view of the Government or anybody else that standing orders ought not be suspended, their arguments ought to be put also. In this way we can have reasoned and intelligent debate which allows honourable senators, irrespective of how they vote, at least to weigh in the balance the arguments of one side or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see that it was the view of the Procedure Committee, which I think has now been overtaken with new membership, that that proposition be put aside but that a time limit be provided. The Committee suggests that time limits may make the rule of relevance more readily enforceable. It has been a matter of contention, very often subject to points of order, that the arguments put for or against the suspension of standing orders are in force not of the argument relating to the suspension but of the substance of the debate that should occur subsequent to the suspension being agreed to. The Committee has suggested that rules of relevance will be more easily identified if there is a time limit. That is not a view that I share. I do not underestimate the competence or the sensitivity of the President or his Deputy or, in turn, his deputies in making determinations as to whether or not a debate is within the realms of relevance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee suggests a time limit for the debate of 30 minutes, with a limit of five minutes for each speaker. It draws upon the experience of the House of Representatives, where a motion for the suspension of standing orders may not be debated for more than 25 minutes, with the first two speakers being limited to 10 minutes and other speakers to five minutes. It is my experience that it is quite impossible to put a cogent and detailed argument in five minutes, particularly given that most arguments in support of the suspension of standing orders are put for a detailed and urgent reason. I cannot imagine how anybody could in five minutes persuade the Senate that the normal business ought to be suspended for the purpose of bringing on something else as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a more fundamental question which ought to be addressed; that is, whether or not we ought to continue the inexorable march towards reducing the time available for all speakers within the chamber. There has been a trend-an inevitable trend, I suspect-to cut back on the speaking time available to senators because of the amount of legislation brought before the chamber. I do not imagine there is any way that the amount of legislation coming before us will diminish, and so short of finding another solution that means, inevitably, that within the time for which the chamber presently sits there will be less time available to each speaker. There are perhaps two other approaches, one being that we increase the hours of sitting on the days we do sit and the other being that we increase the number of days we sit. </PARA>

I do not know that we could sit many more hours, given the extra activities outside the chamber that almost every senator is committed to by way of party committees or parliamentary committees. Most of us arrive in this building at 8.30 in the morning and very few of us leave before midnight. I do not know whether, in the days we do sit, there is more time available, but I suspect that we can find more days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe we should sit Wednesday nights. I have never been able to understand the logic behind our rising at 7.30 on a Wednesday, a broadcast day. It seems to me to be absolutely absurd. The object of parliamentary broadcasts is to provide people with an opportunity to hear the level and persuasion of the debate within the chamber, but on the one night we are broadcast we rise at 7.30. That seems to defeat the logic of having our proceedings broadcast in the first place. Perhaps we should rise early on a Tuesday night or a Thursday night, but certainly not on a Wednesday night. So there is a great deal of logic in the proposition of the honourable senator that we sit on a Wednesday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find little merit in the argument that honourable senators ought to be required to speak for reduced periods. It is absurd to suggest that I could persuade Senator Jones in five minutes that the chamber ought to suspend Standing Orders for the purpose of bringing on a matter of urgency which I was seeking to bring before the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps there is a balance in between. The other concern I have about this matter is that it is proposed to be introduced for a trial basis under Sessional Orders, but the inevitability of Sessional Orders is that, inexorably, as a matter of fact, they become Standing Orders. Whenever speaking time in this chamber has been reduced on a trial basis it has never reverted to the original duration. There has never been a standing order in this chamber, to my knowledge, that has increased the speaking time of any senator. So once we accept that contraction there is no prospect of it being recovered. As one who finds it inappropriate that the speaking time be so reduced as to deny senators an opportunity to put the full force and extent of their debate, I believe that adequate and proper time ought to be available. We have seen the experience in the House of Representatives, which now has shorter speaking times. Almost every speech is seen as an emotional outburst because there is just not time to put the substance or the facts that one wishes to put. I would hope that on further deliberation this proposal is not accepted either as a sessional order or ultimately as a standing order. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had an opportunity to read in detail the annual report of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, but it has been proposed in some circles that there be an amalgamation of Hansard, the Joint House Department and the Parliamentary Library. My inquiries and investigations in my period on the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriation and Staffing compel me to the view that that proposition has no merit. Any savings that can be found in terms of costs or staff can be found only at a management level and, inasmuch as there is fundamentally no management level that is not in some way involved in the intrinsic and day-to-day activities of the departments, I cannot find where the cost savings would come from. When I have looked to those areas where it has been argued cost savings ought to be found, I have found that not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of those departments is in itself a discrete department; each is a specialised department. The Library and those responsible for it have special skills; presumably the same applies to a very large extent to Hansard. I cannot think of anything worse than having Joint House having attached to it the Library or Hansard. We would have two professional organs of the Parliament, two professional departments, attached to the Joint House Department in some obscure way-almost like an extra limb. To my knowledge the Joint House Department has no special skills and no special ability and least of all any capacity to manage other than that which it is already managing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that we have been in the new Parliament House for only a short time, I should be careful in any criticism I make of the Joint House Department, but if its capacity to run a dining room, to have a senator's office cleaned or to deal with the day-to-day functions of this Parliament is any indication of the skill and application that it would apply to the Parliamentary Library and Hansard, I would be the last to be supporting any recommendation that the departments be amalgamated. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the amalgamation proposal is not based on the premise of reducing costs or achieving greater efficiency; it seems to flow from that inevitable demand in society from time to time to amalgamate everything into one so that we have one central decision-making body. Each of the departments has quite separate and distinct functions which are totally incompatible with those of the other. I hope that the legislation tabled some time ago in the other chamber which proposed the amalgamation of the three departments is put aside permanently and that each of those departments is able to get on with the job it is designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have considerable admiration for the skills of the Library, which provides the intellectual resources for the Parliament, and for the skill of Hansard for promptly, efficiently and accurately recording the words of this chamber and the various committees. I hope as the months go by I will have an opportunity and some reason to make some complimentary remarks in respect of Joint House. However, given its present performance, its response to complaints and its competence, I am not optimistic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 has been debated for some days, because some people are very concerned about some of the aspects of what the Australian Democrats are trying to foist on the Australian people. They are trying to foist on to the farming communities problems that should not be put on them. But the Democrats are like that. I remind honourable senators of the purposes of what we are debating here today. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill provides national legislation for the clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The legislation aims to ensure that agricultural and veterinary chemical products perform as intended. The Bill attempts to minimise any possible hazard to the public, to the environment, to the users of agricultural products, and to livestock. The Bill seeks to enhance the export market potential of our agricultural products and the uniformity of assessment and registration of these products within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are now debating cognately a motion to set up a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. The Democrats are trying to bulldoze that motion through by some lying-in-bed arrangements, if you like, with the Government. That concerns us all, because some deal has gone on here between some of the unthinking people in the Government and the Democrats. I do not know what the payoff is. I am sure the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is at the table, is not part of any deal because I know he has the interests of certain people at heart. I feel sorry for him, being part of a government that has taken part in a dirty, little, deceitful deal that was probably set in place in the other House. I do not know whether it was set in place by Mr John Kerin. I do know whether it was set in place by Bob Hawke. I do not know who set it in place.

<PARA>That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, be established to inquire into and report upon:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the adequacy of arrangements under the legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and co-ordination systems for agricultural and veterinary chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be in the Bill. I do not know why that matter has to be looked into. Probably the Bill will be passed, and it looks at those things. Point (b) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA>the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the other thing that the Democrats want us to look into. They also say that they want us to look into the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. That sounds to me as though it came from Senator Coulter. Senator Coulter probably whipped that one into the motion. That is what the motion is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do the Democrats want to have this inquiry? Why do they want a select committee to duplicate so much of the work that has been done already? We said the other day that we were in favour of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, with a couple of provisos. Now we have a motion to set up an inquiry to look into chemicals and all the things that go with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The ridiculous part about this matter is that the Government has already set in place a study into all those things that the Democrats are talking about. The Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) is inquiring into chemical residues in agricultural products. The Democrats want to set up a similar inquiry to duplicate the work. It sounds rather foolish to me. It sounds as though it is a waste of taxpayers' money. But maybe that is what the Democrats are on about. The ASTEC study states that the quality of agricultural products with respect to chemical residues is likely to become a more important factor in the marketing of these products. We agree with that. I agree with that. It also states that the working party will consider the national and international mechanisms to ensure that appropriate standards are developed. The working party will look at the national and international implications of these standards, whether residues are a cause for consumer concern, and the opportunities for the development of new analytical techniques and new and safer agricultural and veterinary chemicals through strategic research. It will also look into other opportunities for contributions through strategic research such as the development of decontamination methods. ASTEC will report on those matters to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) by December this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask again: Why do the Democrats want to have this witch-hunt into the use of chemicals in agriculture in Australia? I will tell the Senate why. They want to do it so that they can get a few of their fringe friends, who will come out of the woodwork from everywhere, to try to denigrate the farmers of this nation, who produce 37 per cent of the export wealth of this country. They are trying to denigrate the farmers who give them a standard of living. A committee such as the Democrats are mooting will duplicate the work that is already being done. Why the Government agreed to a cognate debate I do not know. I cannot understand that at all. In agreeing to a cognate debate it is trying to cloud the issue because of some deals that have been done in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Coulter earlier today expressed some misconceptions about chemicals and whether chemical companies were doing the right thing by the farming community or by the consumers. The Australian Financial Review of 12 October reported a keynote address given at the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia Conference recently by Dr Thayne Dutson, the President of the United States-based Council of Agricultural Science and Technology. His comments sum up the misconceptions Senator Coulter has about how, if people have a chemical free system, the situation will not basically be any different from what it is now. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Thayne Dutson . . . said guarantees of chemical-free food products exploited the fact that the perceptions of consumers relating to pesticides often differed greatly from scientific facts. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not deny that Senator Coulter has a lot of academic ability but I think sometimes some of his thoughts on some issues regarding chemicals are clouded in such a way that he is trying to mislead people about what this inquiry would achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The farming community of Australia has been responsible. Senator Panizza, my very good colleague from Western Australia who has been fighting hard for the farmers of Western Australia, has said on numerous occasions how responsible the farmers in Western Australia are. They have had a look at the contamination problem in the beef industry. All the farmers in Australia have had a look at the problems that have been created by inspectors in America who, as I said earlier today, have over-inspected Australian beef but have not really inspected their own beef. The farmers have looked at this in a proper way and they have put in their own money. The Government has offered $10m over three, four, or five years, but the farming community, and especially the beef producers, have put in their money to clean up their own industry. I think that does them great credit. I think some of the criticisms that have been made about the farming community by my colleagues at the bottom end of the chamber have not done them any credit at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The farming community is responsible. I would like to state again my objection to what the Democrats are on about. I repeat that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill will ensure that chemicals have a thorough testing and that they perform properly. The Australian Science and Technology Council already has an inquiry going into chemical residues in agricultural products and I think the proposal to set up a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals should be thrown out it its entirety by this chamber. I urge members of the Australian Labor Party sitting on the government benches to ask themselves what they are leading the Australian farming community into, and what they are leading our trade relations with the rest of the world into. They are lying in bed with the Democrats by accepting their proposal for a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that, with amendments, we support the thrust of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill but we definitely do not agree in any way with the setting up of a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals which will only duplicate the inquiry which is already being conducted. </PARA>

Madam Acting Deputy President, I can assure you that I will not go over the matters which I have already spoken about at length regarding a cognate debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and Senator Powell's motion to set up a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In the short time available to me I will address my remarks to the proposal by the Australian Democrats. I reiterate, as other senators have already done, that this proposal is a duplication and a waste of time and effort. It is a duplication because the Australian Science and Technology Council is coming out with its finding at the end of the year. It is also a great waste of Commonwealth money, taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are told that we should not be wasting taxpayers' money-our own money-on useless projects, yet here we have the Government setting up another inquiry before the results of the first inquiry have come out. We heard that there were no funds available towards the end of the last year for a national survey on pesticides. So the beef producers, rather than the horticultural industry which put producers in this situation in the first place, had to carry the cost themselves. Exporters of beef make more money out of the beef than do growers. There was no money available for that survey and we had to levy those farmers up to $18 a beast, and a higher amount for each sheep, to carry out this survey. But money is now being made available for this useless witch-hunt. </PARA>
<PARA> As I and other speakers have said before, this is a fishing expedition to suit the Australian Democrats' prejudices and to appease their radical supporters who come in here and make wild allegations under privilege.

The Government had better have a big chequebook. A few of the downturns were the only things reported. But we have had these radicals coming into this chamber trying to bring down the farming community of Australia. As Senator Brownhill has said, farming is the most important industry in Australia. Unfortunately, Senator Brownhill underestimated its importance. To put it in context, the farming community provides 50 per cent of our exports rather than the 35 per cent that he quoted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not on the migration debate, but members on the Government side have tried to do us damage by issuing press releases and so on. There is great potential to damage our international trade. I have nothing against continual monitoring of chemicals and experiments to see where they could go wrong in use. But I believe that all arguments-business arguments over rationalisation, or even family arguments-should be confined to the boardroom, or the home. I do not believe that dirty washing should be hung out in public. We will damage our overseas trade by hanging our dirty washing in public. That is what the Australian Democrats want to do. Senator Sanders is supposed to represent Tasmania, but he has done nothing but bring Tasmania down. Every time he speaks in this chamber he decries his country of birth. I repeat that the place for a good argument is inside the home or inside the boardroom. This motion is a further attack on the 55 Australian chemical companies that have produced chemicals for the good of agriculture in Australia and throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can speak from experience about the use of chemicals in agriculture as I am more familiar with their use in that area than in the veterinary field, dealing with animals. I know that many of the chemicals used in agriculture come from Germany, but Australian companies have developed their own chemicals which are being exported as well as used here and are proving effective. I said that the motion is an attack on the Australian chemical companies. This sort of attack always seems to come from the radicals in this chamber. I shall come now to some points that were made earlier in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If I remember rightly, Senator Coulter said that he had nothing against the idea of compensation to farmers who were affected by the pesticide problem in beef. I heard him say that and I do not think any Australian Democrats senator would deny it. Where is that provided for in the legislation? The Australian Democrats claim to care and say they represent the underprivileged or the downtrodden in Australia. But when it comes to doing something for the farmers, particularly the beef farmers who are affected in this case, people who are being threatened with bankruptcy because of this problem, where is the sympathy of the Australian Democrats? I understand that in Western Australia alone 130 farmers are still under quarantine. Yet when anyone around the fringes of the capital cities is declared to be underprivileged, the Australian Democrats are the first to jump on the bandwagon and express their sympathy. Why do the Democrats not expand their sympathy beyond the city of Melbourne?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Show it to me. I have not seen it. I have read Senator Powell's motion from front to back and I cannot find it. When it comes to farmers and agricultural producers where is the charity of the Australian Democrats? I have not heard any member of the Australian Democrats say that Senator Coulter did not say what I said he did. I have spoken to him privately and I do not think he would mind my mentioning it publicly. He admits that he has nothing against having an inquiry into compensation for those who were affected, but I cannot find it in the petition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said before that in Western Australia some of the heat has come off on the subject of bankruptcies. As much as I dislike admitting that any Labor government has done any good anywhere, I must say that the Western Australian Labor Government has done quite a bit to relieve the situation of the farmers who were facing bankruptcy. That Government put a new measure into action only last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Next I come to something that Senator Powell said. She mentioned a witch-hunt. If there is any witch-hunt it will be in the inquiry into pesticide residues in beef. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Powell" NAMEID="O14">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a new one? When did we have one before? Senator Powell said it was only a witch-hunt into the activities of the departments of agriculture. The departments of agriculture chose to give certain advice and, after all, they employ eminent scientists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, all right. As far back as 1977 a scientist, whose name I forget, in the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia made it known to his Director that there could be a problem with DDT residues in beef. Unfortunately, no notice was taken of the warning he gave and the Department went on, without any further inquiry, recommending the use of DDT. Yet the attitude of Senator Powell is that because the matter affects farmers and has a farming background we cannot have an inquiry into the advice that was given out by the Department of Agriculture. So much for the sympathy of the Australian Democrats for the bush. I understand that attitude, because the Australian Democrats have no support in country areas and they admit they are not ever going to get any. I can give a small example. At the polling booth at which I would normally vote in my home town, on the evening of the counting of the poll at the last Federal election there were two votes for the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am coming to that. There were two votes there out of a total of about 2,000. We did track them down. There were a couple of likely looking Democrats that voted while they were going through on holidays, or something like that. The Democrats fully admit to not having any support in country areas and obviously they are not going to worry about the country people any longer. So much for Senator Powell's sympathy for farmers or anyone else in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Carrying on with the matters I heard during the debate, Senator Powell or some other senator mentioned that the opposition to this inquiry is dying. It is normal to flag something, as certain things have been flagged around this place before. This was flagged in December of last year. Then, hopefully, when the opposition seems to be dying down, the matter is brought on. That has certainly been done in another agricultural debate but I shall not worry about that one. It was mentioned by the Democrats in the debate two days ago that opposition is dying down. To show that is not correct, I would like to quote from two letters. One is from the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia Ltd, dated 18 October 1988, addressed to all senators, Parliament House. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It has come to the attention of this Association that certain implications have been made in Parliament relating to the Australian farm chemical industry's position on the Senate inquiry proposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I believe it has been suggested that the industry is no longer opposed to the proposed inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to clarify the industry position and point out that the position has at no stage altered. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> This opposition in no way stems from a fear on the part of the industry of what such an inquiry may reveal and in no way implies the industry has `something to hide'. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, the industry firmly believes that the proposed inquiry can achieve very little in the way of positive resolutions for Australian consumers or the the agriculture sector. On the contrary, the inquiry has the potential to cause great harm to Australia's hard-earned reputation as a world leader in the production of `clean' agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. The other letter is from the National Farmers Federation (NFF), which once again, I believe, has been quoted as losing its sting towards opposing this wide-ranging witch-hunt. I hear no cries that I am misquoting the Democrats on this. I do not hear from the two who are present and if any are outside the chamber who reckon I do not know what I am talking about they would have been in here by now. This letter from the NFF is also dated 18 October. The letter which commences with `Dear Sir' states:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to re-affirm the farm sector's total-</PARA>
<PARA>the word `total' is underlined-</PARA>
<PARA>opposition to the proposed inquiry, which I understand will be debated in the Senate tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> NFF, the national Commodity Councils and all State farm organisations are unanimously opposed to the move. In our view, it will serve no useful purpose as there already has been a comprehensive inquiry by the Australian Agricultural Council and new legislation for the registration and clearance of veterinary chemicals has been developed. </PARA>
<PARA> NFF is tremendously concerned that a Senate inquiry under Parliamentary privilege could serve as a platform for unsubstantiated allegations which could seriously damage Australia's international trading reputation. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the end paragraph of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I must repeat in the strongest possible terms that the proposed inquiry has absolutely no support from the farm sector. NFF urges the Government and the Australian Democrats to withdraw their support for the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA> It has come to the attention of this Association that certain implications have been made in Parliament relating to the Australian farm chemical industry's position on the Senate inquiry proposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I believe it has been suggested that the industry is no longer opposed to the proposed inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to clarify the industry position and point out that the position has at no stage altered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia, which represents the majority of companies involved in the development, manufacture and sale of farm chemical products, is strongly opposed to a public inquiry into the use of crop protection and animal health products. </PARA>
<PARA> This opposition in no ways stems from a fear on the part of the industry of what such an inquiry may reveal and in no way implies that the industry has `something to hide'. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, the industry firmly believes that the proposed inquiry can achieve very little in the way of positive resolutions for Australian consumers or the agriculture sector. On the contrary, the inquiry has the potential to cause great harm to Australia's hard-earned reputation as a world leader in the production of `clean' agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on farm chemicals and their use in Australia has too often been allowed to proceed on an emotional basis, far removed from scientific facts. The proposed inquiry threatens to allow the debate to degenerate even further.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the issues identified in the proposed terms of reference are being constantly examined by the industry and other groups and are entirely inappropriate for debate in a public forum. However, we do not argue that some of these issues require continuing attention and always welcome the opportunity to sit down and discuss them with interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia boasts the most stringent and effective regulatory system for farm chemicals in the world. This will be further improved with the introduction of the new legislation currently before the Senate. </PARA>

I suppose it needed the Democrats' support again somewhere along the line and it decided finally to give them their lolly. I understand that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill will certainly go through, because we have always supported it and always believed it was long overdue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988 as the primary consideration. However, as a result of an arrangement between the Australian Democrats and the Government, we now find that we have a cognate debate which includes consideration of the Democrats' motion for a select committee on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. As we sought to demonstrate in the previous debate, there is absolutely no relationship between the Democrats' absurd proposal and the responsible legislation which has been introduced by the Government and which has the support-subject to amendments-of the coalition parties. I have to say at the outset that I find it offensive that I am required to debate this Democrats' proposal at a time when we have a serious piece of legislation before us which deserves proper attention and proper support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps we ought to reflect for a moment on the reason that we have both the legislation and the proposal from the Democrats. It will not be forgotten by those who have a care for the rural industry that during 1987, as a result of the diligence of their own testing authorities, the Americans detected in their country some pesticide residues in beef carcasses. Our exports to and our stock in the United States were immediately frozen and a number of properties in Australia were promptly quarantined. As a result, a number of farmers were verging on bankruptcy. When those matters were raised at that time in this Parliament, the coalition supported the industry but, as a result of the contribution of the Democrats and the Government, the cost burden already being borne by the rural sector was substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look at the speakers list on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, I am reminded that there is not one single Labor speaker. As I look at the speakers list on the Democrats' motion I notice that, again, there is not one single Labor speaker. I can draw my own conclusions, and I suppose the logic is compelling: the Government has been forced, as a result of a grotty, back-door deal, to support the Democrats' motion, but the Government members have the good sense not to stand up and try to justify themselves in the chamber. We find there is deafening silence from the Government side of the chamber, but we have the two Democrats senators seeking to justify their position and having the absolute audacity to say they have some care, some compassion and some consideration for the rural sector. That hollow claim stands in absolute and stark contrast to their contribution in a tangible and practical way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Government is hiding behind the skirts of the Democrats. In 1987, when the residues of the organochlorins were found in beef, the moratorium took place; and I remind honourable senators of the extent of that moratorium. There were 85,000 hectares quarantined in Western Australia alone with the potential of 3.5 million hectares being affected. There were 14,461 beef cattle quarantined with a potential to affect half a million beef cattle. The reflex response from the Government was to upgrade the national residue survey, which until that time had been exclusively funded by the Government, presumably because it provided benefits not only to the rural producers, the shippers, the exporters, the overseas consumers and the domestic consumers but also to everybody, as it was intended to provide certainty about the quality of our beef. But of course it did not because, as the national residue survey was conducted at export abattoirs, nothing was done with the results, except that some domestic beef was processed through these abattoirs and the results were provided to each of the State governments. What was the reaction of each of the State governments? What were their endeavours? Absolutely nothing-except in at least one case there was a suggestion that one State government department had discouraged its producers from having their beef tested for fear that they might find high levels of residue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is evidence to indicate that a number of government departments throughout Australia had prior knowledge of the problem that was confronting the industry at that time. It is clear that in Western Australia there was some knowledge 20 years ago. At that time tests were conducted on sheep grazing in dieldrin affected areas. But that was to have the obvious effect. If Senator Powell had a care for the rural industry, she would understand that of course dieldrin tests on sheep in grazing areas will not show levels of residue, because the absorption of dieldrin and organochlorins into the beast is through the oral consumption of the soil. If she knew anything about the grazing habits of sheep, she would know that they eat the top part of the grass, whereas all cattle consume up to a kilogram of dirt a day as a result of their eating habits. It was found that the residue was residing in the fat of the beef cattle. The endeavours and superficial efforts of Western Australia inevitably came to nought. There are suggestions that there was already knowledge in Queensland. There are suggestions that a random survey of properties on the north coast of New South Wales revealed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell might find these statistics boring because they affect the rural industry and not the loonies that she represents; not the harebrained members of society who believe we have to live in an absolute pristine state. Of course it does not interest her. Those random surveys on the north coast of New South Wales indicated that soil on nearly half of all the cane farms was affected and three-quarters of all the banana plantations contained critical levels of dieldrin. Similar levels and degrees of dieldrin were found in most areas of Western Australia. Nothing was done about it. It was of course demonstrated that the national residue survey was an abject failure; in fact, some might describe it as a disgrace, a scandal. What did the Government do about it? It upgraded the quality of the national residue survey and introduced intensive testing. The effect of that was an all-up cost of $11.3m and a once-off annual cost of $1.8m. Who was that cost visited upon? The consumers or taxpayers generally, the shippers, the buyers or the abattoirs? Of course it was not. It was visited upon the farmers. Legislation was promptly introduced into this Parliament levying 15c a head per beast to fund a program which had previously been funded fairly, equitably and reasonably by the Government. That 15c levy was imposed on the farmers because the survey had been found to be an absolute failure. To add to that, in responsible and practical ways the farmers undertook to deal with the problem themselves. In the case of Western Australia, my State, they levied themselves voluntarily to the extent of $3.50 for each beast. That covered the cost of intensive testing and also, in part, the cost of a buy-back program. It needs to be understood that Australia undertook to buy back the beef which had already been bought by the Americans because of the pesticide levels in the beasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the rural sector, in a responsible way, did everything it could. Its farms were quarantined. Farmers had no immediate ongoing income. They had no capacity to raise funds. They did not have the finances to locate their stock elsewhere. When they asked the Government for help, what did the Government say? It said, `This is a national problem which will be solved by one narrow section of the community', notwithstanding the fact that it was dealing with an industry which represents $2 billion a year in exports, and which allows the Australian people to live at a level to which they have become increasingly accustomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers, under those trying and difficult circumstances, had to bring fodder on to their properties at a cost of anything up to $150 a tonne for hay. When they sought to transport stock to unaffected properties they were paying between $13 and $14 per head for an average round trip of 230 to 250 kilometres. They found that, whereas in a very dry season they were able to agist their stock, they were paying $2.50 per beast per week. That did not solve the problem of the calves at foot. So farmers found themselves in a grave and difficult circumstance as a result of dieldrin, DDT, heptachlor, Aldrin and chlordane being found in beef which had been grazing on their properties. I might say that it was not as a result of the beef producers that these organochlorins were there in the first place. In the case of Western Australia they were there because these beef-producing areas had previously been used primarily for the cropping of potatoes. The pesticides had been distributed on those properties at a time when there were potato crops there. The farmers later on either bought the property or converted it for the purpose of beef growing. Without exception, the agriculture department led them to believe that there was no danger, risk or prospect of a health hazard. So, using chemicals which had previously been deemed acceptable by the agricultural department, they then proceeded to farm in the normal fashion, only to be visited some years later with the afflictions of this problem and to find themselves without help, succour or comfort from this cold, cynical Government, aided and abetted by the derelicts who represent themselves by the name of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers were in crisis. They found themselves in difficult circumstances. To add to that, in tandem at that time we had the meat and livestock legislation introduced into the Parliament on 17 December. What was the object of that legislation? It was intended to provide a legislative capacity for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to levy on every farmer in Australia a further $5 a head to pursue testing for the future. So at every stage, at every step, the farmers found themselves crippled by ongoing costs and without relief. In the case of Western Australia, part of the problem was caused by the State Energy Commission (SEC) spraying dieldrin on its electricity poles through vast tracts of raw agricultural land. I assume that the SEC knew not what it was doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the SEC did not listen to the nuts, it has my unqualified support because listening to the nuts in no way would have helped either the SEC or the farmers. It is interesting that at the time of the debate on these matters the Democrats were not heard from. The genesis of their proposed committee was found amongst the coalition parties. We proposed that an inquiry be conducted into the reasons, causes and effects of chemicals upon stock grazed in certain areas. We were hoping that in the event that it could be identified that the responsibility rested other than with the farmers, some suitable, sensible and reasonable compensation might have been granted to these farmers who found themselves in financial peril.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what did we find? The moment we made it public that we were looking at a narrow term of reference for a committee which was intended to provide relief to the rural sector, the Democrats thought, `This is a chance to get the loonies on side'. So they have proposed that a committee be set up with broad terms of reference without exception which do not in any way impinge upon, touch upon or help the rural sector. I ask honourable senators to read the terms of reference of this committee again. Which term of reference of the Democrats' crazy committee will help the rural sector? The answer is none. It is intended to help the bugs and the bears and the beasts of this world. There is nothing about farmers or other human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the contribution the Democrats have made. They have made it quite clear that as a result of their grotty little deal with the Government they would not give support to our proposal. As I look at their terms of reference what do I find about compensation? I find nothing. What do I find about an inquiry as to the causes and the reasons for the problems in the rural sector? Absolutely nothing. Of course I find nothing, because the Democrats are not interested in the rural sector. The Democrats could not care less about the rural sector. The rural sector is not part of their fundamental and natural constituency. Do honourable senators know why? It is because people in the rural sector are pretty wise birds. They get up early in the morning. They would not vote for the Democrats if they were the last political party in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural sector is in an economic crisis for which no relief is provided by the Democrats. The Democrats' proposal bears no relevance to the original proposal put by the Opposition or the legislation that has been introduced by the Government. It in no way analyses the problems of the rural sector. It in no way examines the causes of the failure of the national residue survey. It in no way looks at what might be done for the future. It does absolutely nothing to examine the question of meat inspectors generally. It does nothing to examine the question of inspections and inspection charges at abattoirs, either domestic or export abattoirs. It does absolutely nothing to ensure that there is a proper and effective monitoring at those outlet points. It is simply an inquiry to allow the loonies of this world to give unsubstantiated, incomplete and incompetent evidence which will find its way, because of the bizarre and macabre nature inevitably presented by these people, on to the front page of the daily rags. That is the contribution that the Democrats make to sensible government, responsible decision and a reasoned debate in society. That is their contribution-in the vain hope of getting a bag of votes at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> As a party conceived on the basis of keeping the government and the opposition and the chamber honest and responsible, where do we find them? How would honourable senators like to have that lot looking after their principles or integrity? Of course the Democrats do not have any regard for the rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The sadness for me is that this proposed inquiry will not simply ignore the rural sector: it will drag itself across the body of an ailing rural sector in which the average family income, if I recall, is about $20,000 a year and where the average individual income is about $11,500 a year. The Democrats will use the rural sector as a chopping block for political expediency. Their intention, if they have to, is to dislocate and cause distress to the rural sector to ensure that our overseas buyers are knocking on the doors of the Government asking, `Is this true? Need we have these concerns? Is it a fact?'. Forever and a day our meat exporters and agricultural departments will be hosing these people down, seeking to satisfy themselves that these outlandish and absurd proposals that will be put to this committee have no substance and foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we find that the Democrats and the Government together are putting this proposal in the way they are. One wonders why this legislation is being considered together with the establishment of a committee. The legislation does, in a responsible way, address the problems of the rural sector. The Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) study reflects concern about the problems in our rural sector. A working party has been set up to consider those matters which, when addressed, will enable the rural sector to conduct itself responsibly with respect to chemicals and their application. There is not a matter I can find in the ASTEC study which will not cover the matters enshrined in the motion proposing a committee, except to say that, instead of having the Democrats asking their crazy friends to come along and give a bit of trivial evidence which afterwards will be tested and found wanting, there will be a committee of eminent scientists contemplating these problems and bringing down in a responsible, measured and sensible way recommendations that will go some way to solving the problems we have before us and answering the so far unanswered questions. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the legislation, we hear hardly a word from the Democrats. They are not interested in this legislation any more than they were interested in the national residue survey legislation. However, I do respect for a moment the political judgment of one of the Democrats, the senator from Western Australia who crossed the floor and voted with us in disallowing that legislation. She was smart enough to know that that was where the votes were. I do not know whether she understood the dimension of the problem for the rural sector. The rest of the Democrats joined with the Government to load up the rural sector with another 15c per head without regard, care or concern for that sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noticed in this debate, as I presume we all have, that the Democrats have not laboured this legislation. They have not analysed the legislation. They have not spoken on it, with incidental, inconsequential exception. The Democrats have spoken with regular monotony on their proposal and put aside the matters of major concern. They do not recognise that this legislation deals with some fundamental questions. It seeks to introduce legislation which will provide a scheme for the clearance and use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. It is a scheme that is long overdue and one that I suspect would not have been implemented if it had not been for the problems that visited themselves upon the rural sector last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder about the timing of the legislation when I note, for instance, that there are beef farmers in Victoria who are putting together a fighting fund to mount a test case in the Victorian State Supreme Court for compensation for losses arising from the allegedly incorrect advice offered to them by the Victorian Department of Agriculture. A report by the chief manager of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in that State reveals that departmental officers may have known the effect of persistent organochlorine chemicals in beef as far back as 1971. As I said earlier, similar allegations have been made in other States. In New South Wales a farmer near Kempsey has accused the Department of Agriculture of deliberately withholding information about pesticide residues in the soil. </PARA>
<PARA> If those allegations are wrong, what is irrefutable is that during the period of testing the national residue survey information which was flowing from export abattoirs was made available to the various State Government departments of agriculture. I asked myself the question, as I asked the Government previously, `Why was it that when the level of incidence of retained organochlorins in beef cattle in Western Australia was 250 per cent higher than in the rest of Australia there were no bells ringing?' Why did somebody not say after looking at the statistics, `We've clearly got an aberration; we've clearly got a problem. It is a matter which requires research.'?</PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume that the statistics were filed away as the problem was thought to be too hard. Had the information, modest and ineffective as perhaps it might have been, been studied and examined it may well have prevented a very real problem for the rural sector. The problem of the rural sector is that the Government chose simply to solve that problem by adding to the cost of the rural sector. The rural sector then quite responsibly and promptly created a voluntary levy scheme for immediate and intensive testing. The result was that 400 tests were conducted in 10 months in Western Australia. Around Australia over 1,300 farms were quarantined. It was not necessary. it was a result of a cover-up or incompetence, or both. The contribution of the Government and the Democrats to that crisis was simply to load the rural sector up with more costs and to create further problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As I draw to a close, it is with a tinge of sadness that I note that we have such a serious problem before us and that the rural sector has a serious problem before it. Because this proposal is 10 months old the considered deliberations of the Democrats lead them ultimately not to assist the rural sector but to exacerbate its problems. The Democrats' intention is to get as much free publicity out of their proposal as they possibly can. They will milk this committee for every emotional statement and headline they can possibly get. If it damages our overseas exports and our domestic consumption and if it affects a $2 billion industry, presumably, on the basis of its conduct, so be it. It is hardly a responsible way for a political party in this country to behave. It is hardly preserving and protecting an industry. It does little more than create instability, uncertainty and destabilisation of the industry and a significant part of our economy. One might hope that at the end of the day there will be a deathbed repentance; that the Democrats will recognise the damage they are doing; that the Government will have second thoughts and retreat from the collusion and support it is giving this proposal. But I fear that is a vain hope. I suspect that at the end of the day we will see not only the passing of this legislation-hopefully, with our amendments-but also a corruption of integrity in terms of the ideals which ought to be applied to a sector of our economy, and, sadly, we will see the setting up of this inquiry.</PARA>

It got the Democrats' support for the resource rent tax after the Democrats had twice rejected that tax and, two or three days later, a proposal was put up for an agricultural chemicals inquiry. Such an inquiry will now go around Australia and take evidence. The Government of this nation sold out the beef producers, the pineapple producers, the banana producers, the wheat producers, the cattle producers and the wool producers to get its resource rent tax through this Parliament. That was a disgraceful performance and one for which I hold those opposite fully responsible. It is no wonder that none of them has the audacity to get up and defend himself.

The establishment of this committee flies in the face of the Australian Agricultural Council, which is doing very similar work and doing it well. A coalition of Labor, National and Liberal agriculture Ministers who are responsible to the farming communities in their respective States is investigating the use of chemicals in Australia. Another organisation is also investigating the matter. Now we are to have a third organisation, a parliamentary committee which, at great expense to the Australian community, will fly from State to State to do the job of the two organisations that have already been set up. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the most wasteful exercises that I have ever seen in this Parliament. Senator Walsh is always preaching to us about how we should be saving money and how the Labor Party is trying to cut government expenditure. I would like him to put his view on this matter before the Parliament, as he is one of the few rural representatives in the Labor Party. But there is no way in the world that Senator Walsh will be putting on the record what he thinks. </PARA>
<PARA> I rose to speak only briefly. I want to give my colleague Senator Lewis the chance to voice his opposition on behalf of the farmers of his State of Victoria. I thank him for allowing me a brief opportunity to enter this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the President of the Senate wishes to make a statement about an important matter before the Senate rises at 7.30 this evening, so as soon as he comes in I shall seek leave to continue my remarks later. The Senate is currently debating two matters. We are debating principally the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1988, and the Government-not the Australian Democrats-has moved a motion which has brought forward for debate cognately a motion by Senator Powell to set up a select committee to examine agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. It is the Government that has brought Senator Powell's motion forward for debate and it is the Government which will be supporting the motion, so it is the Government which will be establishing the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia proposed by Senator Powell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Opposition parties have taken every step we can to avoid the establishment of that Committee. We opposed as strongly as we could the motion that these matters be debated cognately, that this motion of Senator Powell's come up to be debated with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill. We voted against it, but the motion was supported by all Government senators. Not one Government senator spoke in favour of the proposal that the matters should be debated separately-in other words, that the motion should come on for debate with the Bill-except Senator Cook, who is the Minister with responsibility for the Bill, and all he had to say was that he had heard our arguments against the proposal, he was not satisfied that our arguments were compelling and so the Government would be supporting the Democrats proposal. That is not an argument for it; it is a negative of a negative. So we have not heard from one Government senator the reasons why this motion should be debated cognately with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go a step further. In the course of my remarks against that proposal I put two very definite propositions. I put firstly that the reason the Government was supporting the Democrats proposal was that some deal had been done between the Government and the Democrats whereby the Democrats supported some Government measure and in return the Government agreed to push this proposal forward. Having put that general proposition, I went on to put the specific proposition-that it was our belief that the measure the deal was done over was the resource rent tax, and that in exchange for the Democrats' support for the resource rent tax the Government, and in particular Minister Kerin, said, `Yes, we will set up the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia'. I put both of those propositions and said, `Senator Powell will get her opportunity to deny it if it is not true, and Senator Cook on behalf of the Government will get his opportunity to deny it if it is not true'. Neither of them has denied either proposition. Not one word has either of them said about either proposition. It is one of the most aggressive accusations that has ever been made in this chamber-that there was a deal done on votes: `You vote for this measure and we will vote for that measure; blow the farmers of Australia, we don't care about them'. The Government wanted its resource rent tax, which the Democrats had twice voted against, but when the crunch came the Government bought their votes. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that accusation now-this is the third time I have made it-and I wait to hear someone deny it on behalf of the Democrats or the Government. It may be that some of the Democrats-I see one in the chamber-may not have been aware of the deal, because I believe it was a confidential deal done between Senator Powell and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. So it may be that some of the Democrats are not aware of it, and certainly some members of the Government are not aware of the deal. It is quite clear that Government senators are absolutely appalled by it. Not one of them has come into this chamber to speak on either the motion that the two matters be debated cognately or the motion to establish a committee. It is clear that Government senators are, as I say, appalled at the proposal to establish this committee. They are not supporting it in any way. There have been no Government speakers in favour of it, but they know that Minister Kerin has locked them into this deal and they cannot get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this deal is that Australian farmers and Australian primary produce are to be the sacrificial lamb. There will be a public examination of the social and environmental impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals on primary produce in Australia. I have no doubt there are some chemicals which should not be used in primary production, and of course many have already been banned. I have no doubt that there will be people prepared to give evidence that all chemicals should be banned in primary production, and they will have very strong beliefs as to why they are right. They may be right; I do not know. I do not prejudge the issue. But that would mean action should be taken all around the world. This evidence will be limited and restricted purely to the use of chemicals in Australia, and such evidence will then be blown right around the world to the detriment of Australian primary production and to the detriment of Australian primary producers. I see that the President has now taken the chair, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time today Senator Boswell asked me a question concerning a resolution of the Aboriginal Development Commission relating to the presentation of evidence to parliamentary committees. Senator Boswell suggested that the Commission had passed a resolution to the effect that documents were not to be presented to any parliamentary committee without the prior approval of the Commission, and that this related to evidence requested by a Senate Estimates committee and the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I table a copy of the resolution of the Commission dated 10 October 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that on 11 October Senator Peter Baume asked me a question concerning the protection of witnesses and the activities of the Aboriginal Development Commission, and that on the following day I advised that the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was inquiring into that matter and that I would not take any further action until the Committee had concluded its investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the matter raised by Senator Boswell I gave an undertaking to investigate it as a matter of urgency, and I wrote to the Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission to inquire whether any resolution of the kind referred to by Senator Boswell had in fact been passed by the Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the Senate briefly on the contribution of scientists in the peace movement and the critical role they are playing in education and technology in this country. When I was at Sydney University as an honours student of English, I heard much from my lecturers about `the two cultures'-science and the humanities-and I was exceedingly frustrated by what was presented to me as an apparently irreconcilable difference between the two. Science was for the boys who studied the world of hard facts within the rigors imposed by empirical discipline. Humanities, on the other hand, was largely for the girls. With only uncertain vocational direction, other than school teaching, we were directed towards the softer subjects to develop our aesthetic, ethical, literary and emotional sensibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not until my honours year that this gap between the two cultures was partially breached for me, largely by a very well read and intellectually stimulating Canadian lecturer. It was she and my fellow students, some of whom had completed a science degree, who exposed me to the history and philosophy of scientific ideas. The effect upon me was profound, something akin to a personal revolution. I began to perceive how damaging to the development of human society was this false dichotomy between science and the humanities, which at university took the form of a very tangible hostility between students from the different faculties. Arts students regarded science students as yobbos, able to deal only with the material world, while arts students were viewed as intellectual snobs; and each was contemptuous of the other. I am pleased that this division has been somewhat eroded at certain Australian universities during the 1970s, although I do not believe we have gone far enough in this direction. When science lecturers begin to quote Shakespeare and Germaine Greer in their lectures and when arts students study the influence of Darwin on literature and culture, we will have begun to heal this educational schizophrenia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1960s and early 1970s, when I was a student at Sydney University, I came across very few science students in the anti-Vietnam movement. This may have been partly due to the heavy demands of course work and assignments, but it was, I think, one of the subliminal results of our educational system. There was little, if anything, in the education of science students to encourage them to develop political opinions or political involvement. Quite the contrary; they were taught to aspire to some notion of objectivity, much as lawyers are taught, without realising how inherently conservative that notion of objectivity was. </PARA>
<PARA> A political conscience cannot be nurtured in a laboratory under conditions of strict scientific method because it involves a value judgment, and that belonged to the arts student whose training, it seemed, was almost entirely directed towards that end. No matter that those judgments were often ill-informed, we made them nonetheless and, in our own way, became as moralistic about, as the science students appeared to be detached from, the political turmoil of the period. </PARA>
<PARA> Alongside the new political activism there was the growth of another significant movement in the 1960s-the environment and conservation movement-which in those early days attracted a strong luddite component of which I was never a part. Like many of my fellow students, I was disturbed by the escalating impact of humans on the environment but, as a young feminist caught up in that movement too, I was also conscious of the liberating influence of some technology on women's lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly during this tumultuous period I became aware that my arts education was inadequate in helping me make informed judgments. It was not until several years later in my publishing career that I met another inspired mentor, this time a scientist, who helped me bridge the gap. An American zoologist, this scientist was an early student of Paul Ehrlich and came to Australia in the late 1960s to work as an ecologist, believing that Australia still had some environment left to save. In the late 1970s, together with a second scientist, we co-edited and co-authored a book about Australian ecology for which our long labours were rewarded with a prize from the Royal Australian Zoological Society. </PARA>
<PARA> Ecology presented itself as an interdisciplinary study which integrated the physical, biological and social sciences. Essentially a study of processes, it required an interpretive application of mind as well as the capacity to be directly useful not only in describing how human beings were affecting the global environment, but also in proposing ways of minimising that impact for the long term survival of ourselves and the planet. Unlike many of his colleagues at the Museum of Australian who made public statements strictly on the findings of their research, this scientist became quite a controversial figure in expressing strong public opinions on environmental matters. Although he was regarded with dismay by some of his more conservative colleagues, his strong advocacy of conservation issues at local, State and national levels has done much to draw public attention to the significance of loss of wildlife species, the impact of woodchipping in Australian forests, urban pollution, and other matters. Perhaps even more than his considerable scientific ability, I was struck by his great willingness and his ability to communicate not only the findings of his research but also their significance in a social and political context. In this respect, when I first met in 1975, I found him quite unusual. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great respect for the work carried out by the organisations, Scientists Against Nuclear Arms (SANA) and Professional Organisations Against Nuclear Arms. SANA was formed some five years ago. It has been particularly useful in producing a regular and very informative newsletter which has done much to publicise the issues and to provide much needed material for a higher level of debate in the peace movement. Like Dr Helen Caldicott, I have an abhorrence of the jargon of the military industrial machine, but we should also recognise that our arguments against the use of nuclear arms will have to be at least as sophisticated and well informed as those who defend them. </PARA>
<PARA> First and foremost, because of the special training, education and skills of scientists, it is especially incumbent on them to seek out the facts. Much of the material dealing with, say, the composition and structure of nuclear arms, or the technology of arms verification is highly technical in nature and is not accessible to a lay reader such as myself. I am not able to tell whether a technical expert is fudging the results of his or her research. It is up to members of SANA and other similar organisations to scrutinise the results of scientific research by their peers into various aspects of the nuclear arms race and to draw attention to failures of method or errors in scientific logic. This may involve setting aside time from personal research interests to read scientific journals from overseas, or it may involve contacting colleagues in equivalent organisations abroad for their response to the research under scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe, however, that scientists should limit themselves to the presentation of the facts. Facts do not speak for themselves: they require interpretation-by which I mean they need to be explained. If scientists are going to address an audience other than scientists, which I believe they must, this interpretation must be written or spoken in a language accessible to non-scientists. </PARA>
<PARA> The formation of SANA and particularly the publication of Update has done much to present sometimes recondite scientific information to a broader community. Within Australian scientific circles, however, there is still, with some notable exceptions, an academic diffidence about speaking out publicly on certain issues when more than a scientific interpretation is required. This may be due to several reasons. It may be that scientists feel that it is not their role to go beyond the facts and the interpretation of those facts. It may be they lack the confidence that is acquired with an arts education to take a moral stand on controversial issues. It may be an unfamiliarity with the non-scientific language of ethical discourse. It may be academic timidity, a reluctance to expose oneself to criticism from colleagues co-existing in a conservative and circumscribed academic community. It may be a natural and quite understandable distaste for entering the political arena. These are, in my opinion, red herrings. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Soviet physicist Anatoly Sakharov has argued, there is a strong moral obligation on scientists to overcome their natural diffidence to participate individually and collectively in this urgent debate on nuclear arms. After all, science produced the atom bomb, and a large proportion of the world's scientists are currently employed in military research of one kind or another. Their position is not neutral or objective: they are actively supporting the arms race. As colleagues, these scientists must be encouraged and persuaded as a group and as individuals to withdraw their labour, much as unions do or as Lysistrata and her consoeurs did in Ancient Greece, and they must be offered constructive alternatives. If a national strike of scientists is not even a remote possibility at this time, at least a national organisation such as SANA could take the Australian Government to task for its particular contribution to the nuclear arms race. </PARA>
<PARA> On such matters SANA would need to be able to respond relatively quickly to changes in government policy and this would require a concerted and continuous effort by the organisation to familiarise itself with the details of those policies. This is the laudable aim of the Rainbow alliance, a group consisting largely of Australian social science academics who meet regularly to discuss and analyse government policies on a range of issues, including defence, in the context of hypothetical short term, mid-term and long term goals for Australian society. Having established a national position in relation to a particular government policy, SANA would also need to establish the means of publicising its position. SANA must develop some such strategy in order to establish itself as an organisation with a national voice and not just one preaching to an audience of converted colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading the aims of SANA I am struck by the apparent dissociation of the arms race from what many regard as closely related issues, such as consideration of the opportunity costs of the arms race and military spending. I do not believe that we can have meaningful discussions about ending the arms race unless we address the question of the kind of peace we want. </PARA>
<PARA> While reducing the arms race must be the immediate focus of the activities of the peace movement we would be myopic to ignore or avoid an analysis of the causes of war in our society. That must entail a very thorough re-examination of our social, economic and political structures, the distribution of wealth, social justice, sex role stereotyping and conditioning, as well as the continuous re-evaluation of empirical science for all its contribution to modern life. Scientists who are teachers in schools and universities have a very special role to play in this regard. When they stand in front of a class not only are they teaching the facts but also they are helping to shape in their pupils an attitude towards the world. The influence of teachers, while often not immediately acknowledged, can be inestimable in later years. An inspired teacher can influence a human for life and the development of a scientific ethic in young minds will produce a more socially concerned generation of scientists in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are three areas in particular in which concerned scientists could become more active. The first relates to freedom of information (FOI) legislation in Australia. There is a great necessity for the peace movement to develop a more informed and sophisticated debate to counter the proponents of the arms race. Generally, these proponents have at their disposal many more resources than the peace movement because they are intimately associated with governments and military complexes which have billions of dollars at their disposal, not to mention control of huge media conglomerates. These governments and military establishments are paranoically obsessive about secrecy, particularly about nuclear matters, and this is something that should be particularly offensive to scientists as seekers of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> While the United States of America sends its nuclear aids-bearing ships to Australian shores it must also be recognised that it provides much of the information that we in the peace movement need to wage our war of words. This information is obtained under the considerably more liberal FOI legislation that exists in the United States. SANA could very usefully lobby the Federal Government to relax its freedom of information legislation and press at the State level for wide-ranging FOI Acts. We need more information rather than less. </PARA>
<PARA> With the great respect accorded to scientists in our community, SANA members could consider taking on the argument of national security-a common reason given for denying access to information-as well as pointing out the folly of accepting the secrecy provisions of foreign powers, for example, in relation to the United States and United Kingdom policies of neither confirming nor denying the presence of weapons on board their ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area in which organisations such as SANA could become more active is in its dissemination of information to the active unions in the peace movement, particularly the waterfront unions, which are in the front line of a nuclear accident should it occur. I believe that the unions would welcome such an approach and I believe that scientists would also benefit from hearing about the difficulties the unions face, both on site and in taking a stand on peace issues. It is vital that we forge links widely in the peace movement in order to develop a broad base of support for peace and disarmament issues. </PARA>
<PARA> A third initiative is for organisations such as SANA to become actively involved with the soon to be established Australian science and technology information service, a science information service developed by science broadcaster Peter Pockley and the Australian Academy of Science for journalists, politicians and schools. This may provide a significant means of promulgating correct information about the arms race to the media, to parliamentarians and to students. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, let me commend the excellent work of SANA, Professional Organisations Against Nuclear Arms, the Medical Association for Prevention of War and other similar organisations in the past. I encourage them to continue to take an active role in the Australian peace movement. </PARA>
