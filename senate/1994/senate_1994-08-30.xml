<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In recent days the minister has denied offering the member for Lalor, Barry Jones, a diplomatic post as an inducement to hand over his seat to him. Today, we learn that Mr Jones has in fact kept a detailed record of the public and private moves to persuade him to shift from his seat, including virtually verbatim records of key conversations with the Prime Minister and Senator Gareth Evans, and that the records suggest that the prospect of employment outside parliament was in fact offered. I ask the minister what alternative employment prospect was raised with Mr Jones during the course of these discussions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that this has anything whatever to do with my ministerial portfolio and I believe the question is out of order. But for the record let me repeat absolutely and unequivocally that there was no offer of any diplomatic appointment, nor anything more than a fleeting, passing reference to whether either of us would be interested in that sort of career at some future stage. The answer from both of us was no. The only other context in which life after political death was the subject of some particular discussion was in the context of a discussion about how Mr Jones's extraordinarily well-developed talents for thinking, for writing and for articulating a vision about the future of Australia might best be utilised if he were to leave parliament. Some options were canvassed in that respect. Beyond that, I do not propose to go into what was at the time a private conversation and should have remained so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is interesting that the minister confirms that a fleeting, passing reference to a diplomatic post did occur. This should be put in the context of what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in today's editorial described as the `disturbing trend by the Labor Government to regard Federal appointments as patronage to be dispensed as part of the spoils of office'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> listed some appointments including those of Bannon, Kirner, Kerin, Ryan, Tate, Cavalier, Hayden, McClelland, Jenkins, Bowen, Maguire, Hurford, Sibraa, Blewett and Grimes. The minister might remember Mr Charles who lost his seat so that a place could be found for Mr Crean. Mr Charles was sent off to San Francisco as a consul-general with no experience whatsoever. With that background, should not the public regard a fleeting, passing reference to a diplomatic post as an inducement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: Senator Evans, by reading out a list of Liberal appointees in previous governments, has shown that that was the practice of the previous government. After all, Mr Fraser got three backbenchers or ministers out of the road in 1980&mdash;he appointed them to overseas posts&mdash;all of whom who performed well. Senator Evans is entitled to indicate the credentials of Senator Hill and the Liberal Party. In raising the issue of Labor appointees, they are entitled to have the Liberal appointees brought to their attention, because that is what Senator Evans is relying on as a precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of order is that the minister fails to understand the distinction; that is, the jobs that I have referred to have been Labor members who have been removed to create vacancies and given a benefit at the public expense. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> refers to it as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . entrenching a political culture that its boys and girls can expect to be supported by the taxpayer long after their political careers are over.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the question concerned an inducement that was offered to Barry Jones to create a vacancy for the foreign minister, and that is why it is so different from all of the other examples that Senator Evans has given.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza runs around the world looking for a black cloud to stand under. I have a bit of good news, and I am sorry Senator Panizza has to listen to it. This booklet contains a preface from the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr McGauchie, who fully endorses the very close cooperation between the Australian government and the Australian rural industry in achieving the major results for Australia on agriculture&mdash;as he properly does and should&mdash;because my predecessors, collectively, did an outstanding job in achieving this outcome. They received tremendous support from the rural industry and industry groups in that activity. It is a major win for the Australian rural community. We have to remember that it is not the end of the process of gaining better market access for Australia, but it is a very good start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other preliminary point to realise is that the key question now is to get these commitments implemented. I am optimistic that the results of the Round will be implemented, particularly by the major players&mdash;namely, the United States, Japan and the European Union&mdash;and I will be writing to key US congressional leaders to urge the early passage of the Uruguay Round legislation, particularly in my capacity as chair of the Cairns Group because those countries share a very profound concern about that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the hard edge of the benefits. It is very easy for people to make quips in here about 1999 and about all those things that Senator Panizza wishes were, but are not, true. The fact of the matter is this: ABARE has assessed the benefits for beef at approximately $330 million each year over the six-year implementation period; $210 million a year for dairy; $320 million for wheat; $50 million for coarse grains; $30 million for rice&mdash;for 2,000 rice-growing families there will be $30 million; and $10 million for sugar each year over the six-year implementation period. These are very substantial, important, recognised and welcomed benefits for our rural communities, thanks to the combined good work of the Australian government, the ministers and the public servants who provided the enormous support, and the industry groups and industry organisations which also participated and whose support was invaluable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that there will be increased export income for Australia's farmers, heightened economic activity in rural communities and additional jobs in country towns and regional centres. They are gains that will not just fall into our laps; we will have to work for them and we will have to be competitive to win them. But there are important tangible opportunities and very substantial benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round deal, for example, will provide significant openings for our beef exports to the US market in particular which alone could provide additional exports of around $1 billion over the implementation period. We will be working with our fellow Cairns Group members to ensure that the commitments are honoured and that the good start we have achieved is built upon. That Cairns Group, which was established at Australia's initiative, will be working with us to ensure that the pressure for agricultural trade reform is maintained so that we can get even greater opportunities for Australia's rural exporters and enable the income gains that should flow to so many deserving Australian farming communities, regional centres and country towns to be built upon in future years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the astonishing admissions yesterday by Mr Crean in the other place regarding the appointment of Joan Kirner to the $104,000 position as chairperson of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. The minister will be aware that Mr Crean indicated that he had checked with Mrs Kirner on her health to carry out this job and was assured that she could perform this full-time job. At the same time, Mrs Kirner apparently had an application before the Victorian Parliamentary Superannuation Fund indicating that she was in poor health and that this had forced her to leave the parliament. Mrs Kirner was in such poor health that she needed $360,000 extra from the superannuation fund while at the same time she was apparently in such good health that she could take on a $104,000 job offered by the Keating government. Could the minister please explain this farcical position that Mrs Kirner has placed herself in as part of Labor's relentless quest to plunder the public purse for its cronies? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising that I should find helpful some specific briefing on this matter because it is outside my immediate area of portfolio responsibility. But the situation is, as the Hon. Simon Crean said in the house yesterday, that the issues associated with any question of Mrs Kirner's health and her claim against the Victorian government were discussed with her before her appointment, and Mr Crean was satisfied that she could fulfil the role; otherwise she would not have been appointed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my point of order is on the basis of relevance. The question is quite clear. What the minister is being asked to tell us is how it is that someone can be considered competent for one job and so unwell as to require extra funds from the superannuation fund, on the other hand. He cannot answer that simply by listing out the reasons why the minister thought she could do the job. She may well be able to do the job. That is not what is at issue. What is at issue is: if she can do the job, how come she is putting her snout in the trough for more money from the super fund? That is the question he should be answering.

As Senator Vanstone said, listing a whole host of Mrs Kirner's apparent achievements&mdash;I have to say that that is very disputable as well&mdash;is not answering the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. While I have been critical of the way this government has failed to address some key areas of Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage, I ask whether he can realistically have a land fund to address dispossession and the building of an economic base but at the same time say that it must not primarily be about land? Can he claim to acknowledge that the root cause of Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage is dispossession, as the Leader of the Opposition did about an hour ago, but then say that land to provide an economic base is not the answer?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard some slow and gentle lobs in my time, but none more attractive than that. Senator Kernot has of course put her finger absolutely, squarely and legitimately on the matter in issue, so far as the land fund is concerned. What we are talking about with the land fund is not only a mechanism to enable the redress of a long and intensely felt cultural and spiritual need, but also a mechanism to address an economic need to create a base&mdash;a solid foundation, an economically firm foundation&mdash;on which Aboriginal people in various parts of Australia can rebuild their lives not only with spiritual and psychological confidence but also with the economic wherewithal, whether it is on pastoral stations, tourist properties or things of that kind, in order to recover confidence and prosperity for themselves and their families in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course Aboriginal people have many other needs&mdash;health needs, education needs, housing needs and needs for other forms of social expenditure on infrastructure&mdash;we all know that. We all know that we have been spending massively to address those needs and will continue to do so. But we also know that those needs are best addressed by specific functional appropriations&mdash;what we have been doing and more of the same&mdash;and we will continue to do that.</PARA>

I refer to the release last week of ABS data relating to Australian business enterprise expenditure on research and development for the 1992-93 financial year.

What action is the government taking to maintain and increase this level of growth in business R&amp;D?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In checking the level of research and development in Australia one has to have regard to the level of government funded research and development. On that index, Australia ranks about fourth in the whole of the OECD. But on business funded, private sector funded research and development, Australia ranks very much at the bottom of the OECD table. So the government has been concerned to stimulate the private sector into investing more funds in research and development in order to gain the competitive edge in industry. What is heartening from the figures referred to in this question is that the evidence is coming through now that the private sector is responding and deserves to be congratulated on its response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Australian Bureau of Statistics data show a sharp increase in business research and development expenditure between the 1991-92 financial year and the 1992-93 financial year to bring it to the highest ever levels that it has achieved in Australia. We achieved a stunning 17 per cent real increase in research and development in just one year. Business research and development expenditure in Australia has now reached almost $A2.8 billion, or 0.67 per cent of gross domestic product. That is up 0.25 per cent from just a year ago. So we have moved from 0.25 per cent to 0.67 per cent in the space of one year&mdash;a strong performance indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s industrial research and development grew faster in Australia than in all but one other OECD country. From 1981-82 to 1991-92&mdash;that is, a 10-year span&mdash;we achieved a real annual growth of 13 per cent in our business research and development expenditure. In that period, Australia applied for more patents than any other country in the OECD. During the period of the recession, research and development expenditure in Australia held up. It did not decline as it did in most other countries in the world. Business maintained its commitment in the hard times; it is not surprising that it has gone on with it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment in research and development is further evidence that our economic strategies and the work we have put into restructuring the Australian economy are paying dividends and are starting to be responded to more broadly by the private sector. Government settings to encourage research and development are the 150 per cent tax concession on R&amp;D, the industry innovation program, our partnerships for development program and the industry development arrangements. All these have worked with the Australian private sector in lifting those levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, what should also be said is that, notwithstanding this very good performance, we still have a way to go and we still have much to do to improve on what has been historically a poor performance overall. While we have improved well and the signs are promising, we have not got to the ideal yet&mdash;although during the last period of the recession, whilst research and development fell off in France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the United States, it grew in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler deserves marks for being a constant exponent of this view of industry policy and for being one of the few people in this chamber who actually takes an interest in the subject. I would end good marks for Senator Spindler from this point on because the issues that he takes up, I would argue, are wrong in policy terms, wrong for Australia and represent, by inference, a return to the levels of high protection and an inward looking, low growth economy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking a snapshot in time at any one stage in a transition process, one can make a case that the change is not working. However, when we opened the Australian economy and began to internationalise it, we knew that it was not like turning on an electric light&mdash;it does not suddenly happen that all the things that we want to see arrived at in policy terms occur. Transition involves long hard work, government leadership and industry change. We are in the midst of a transition now, so figures halfway through or part-way through the transition process do not reflect the underlying direction of change, nor do they reflect the fact that these are desirable changes for the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler refers to manufacturing exports. For the last five years manufacturing exports have grown, year on year, at 12 per cent. Over the last five years elaborately transformed manufactures have grown, year on year, at 19.1 per cent. We are seeing massive growth in manufacturing exports from this country, and most of it in elaborately transformed manufactures. That continuing growth reflects a major restructuring of the Australian economy and our economic capacity. That is the important figure to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler refers to the balance of payments. I have the balance of payments figures here. Senator Spindler neglected to remind us that the export of merchandised goods went up 12 per cent in the last 12 months&mdash;a growth of 12 per cent&mdash;while merchandised imports went up at a rate of 8.4 per cent, and most of the merchandised imports are probably manufacturing imports. So Senator Spindler has not drawn the obvious comparison: on the latest balance of payments figures, manufacturing exports are growing faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask what we would do as an alternative. Given what Senator Spindler has said on many occasions in the past, the only alternative is a return to high protection, a return to selective protection&mdash;to ignore the international outcome of the GATT and do industry specific things. Of course, there is no record in Australia of that type of policy working. If there is a bipartisanship in Australian politics it is that we have to make this economy more competitive by opening it up to international competition and lowering the levels of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing about the  balance of payments figures is that they show that we are importing a lot of capital equipment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Not only was the minister's answer not relevant, but also she was totally ignorant. I was referring to the fact that the minister for health has been giving commitments of her support for general practice and to the quality of care in general practice, but at the same time she has increased the GP's rebate this year by only 15c&mdash;well below anything that goes towards the costs of their practice. This will mean that those who continue to bulk-bill will be forced into an assembly line quality of care. Does the minister not care about that? It also means that those who do not go into assembly line quality of care will be reducing bulk-billing to their non-card-holding patients, and that effectively will be a government induced co-payment. Is not the minister concerned about this, considering her well-known concern about co-payments? What is she going to do about it? Is it not double standards, is it not hypocrisy, for the minister to sit there, having gained her place on the front bench through the promise of the Prime Minister to abolish co-payments?</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not think it was important enough to warrant a reply, but I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so now. Some months ago the World Trade Organisation or the GATT, the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation, invited countries to express interest in where they would like the World Trade Organisation headquarters to be. The reason Australia did not support any Asian candidates was that no Asian country expressed any interest. There were no nominations from this region. There were no countries here that said they wanted it. No countries were available for us to support, so we did not support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two matters where there is potential for the Asia-Pacific region influence to be enhanced.

The second is the question of candidature for the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. There is a candidate from Korea and we have indicated, firstly, that our preference is for a candidate from the Asia-Pacific region, of which there are at least two, and, secondly, that for as long as the trade minister from Korea is a potential candidate, we are happy to support him. So where there are opportunities to enhance the influence of the Asia-Pacific region within the World Trade Organisation we are taking it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to tell the Senate about the new social security agreement that provides for a more equitable sharing of the cost of pensions paid to people who move between Australia and New Zealand. It allows for any possible fluctuations in future migration patterns, and it ensures that neither country will suddenly face an excessive burden in paying pensions to people who spend most or all of their working lives in the other country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new agreement New Zealand will reimburse Australia for pensions paid to people from New Zealand with less than 10 years residence in Australia during their working lives and who have arrived here since 1983. Australia will similarly reimburse New Zealand for the pensions it pays to people from Australia. This arrangement captures the bulk of pensioners who arrived during the peak years of New Zealand's migration in the late 1980s. The level of reimbursement will be based broadly on the portion of a person's working life spent in the former country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know that the agreement does not cover unemployment benefits or basic family payments. Indeed, a year or so ago Australia changed the rules about the eligibility of New Zealanders for unemployment benefits in particular, and there is now a 26-week waiting period for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance that applies to all newly arrived immigrants, including New Zealanders. It encourages all new arrivals, particularly New Zealanders, to think about what kind of support they will be able to provide for themselves before moving here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new cost sharing arrangements will begin from 1 January 1995, and when they come into effect they will cover all new pensioner arrivals from that date. They will be phased in for people who arrived between 1 January 1983 and 1 January 1995, and the first year of full reimbursement will be 1998-99. Reimbursement by New Zealand to Australia, currently at $23 million a year, is likely to triple over the next few years as the arrangements are phased in, so I think it is a very important extra step in our relationship with New Zealand. From those figures it can be seen that it will be of great financial benefit to Australia. We welcome New Zealanders, we are pleased to assist them, but we also like that sharing of the costs.</PARA>

Commonwealth payments to the states made up $58.3 million of this amount and the remainder was drawn out of reserves of Commonwealth funds held by the states. During 1993-94, $92 million from reserves of Commonwealth funds held by the states was used to assist farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reserves held by the states arose during RAS 1988 where states received Commonwealth funding according to a formula, whether the amount was expended or not&mdash;a practice, I might note, that has been criticised from time to time by the Auditor-General.

<PARA>This is a very serious matter. When a matter of a similar type was raised in the New South Wales parliament not long ago, Senator Gareth Evans's colleague the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Carr, in that instance referring to Mr Greiner, put it in terms of an issue of official corruption and a criminal conspiracy. In other words, that is the way he was describing the issue of a possible inducement being offered to a member of parliament to resign his seat to the advantage of an individual or the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being raised here is whether Senator Evans offered an inducement&mdash;a diplomatic post or some other government benefit&mdash;to Mr Barry Jones to resign his seat in order that he, Senator Evans, might take that seat and thus further his ambitions to one day be Prime Minister, succeeding Mr Keating. Of course, the allegation is in some ways even more important because it is said that Senator Evans did that with the knowledge and the support of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. So the Prime Minister as well as the Leader of the Government in the Senate is involved in this. Few matters of greater seriousness could be brought into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found that Senator Evans has changed his position over the last few days. When this matter was first raised with him by me in this place last week I asked him specifically about a diplomatic post being offered in relation to Beirut or whether there was any other inducement and he said no. Now that we know a little more about the matter we can read his words and see that he selected his words very carefully. He said that an ambassadorship in Beirut was not offered and no inducement was offered. We have subsequently learned more about what Senator Evans defines as `no inducement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when Senator Knowles came into the chamber after an article by Geoff Kitney appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> Senator Evans changed his position. I remind honourable senators that Geoff Kitney said that he had reason to believe that, with Keating's approval, Senator Evans had in fact offered Mr Jones a diplomatic post. Senator Knowles therefore came into the chamber and asked Senator Evans about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans changed his position because, on that occasion, he said that he did not offer Mr Jones a diplomatic post but that the `possibility of a life after politics was the subject, as one might have expected, of some discussion in an earlier conversation, some time before the first conversation in which the question of Bruce was even raised'. On the second question, we find that Senator Evans acknowledges that the issue of a job had been raised with Mr Jones but says that it was on an earlier occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As more information flows&mdash;one suspects that a fair bit of it is flowing from Mr Jones&mdash;another article appeared this morning, this one written by Geoffrey Barker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review.</EMPHASIS> It refers in some detail to the position of Mr Jones and to the fact that he had kept detailed records of the conversations between Senator Evans and himself and the Prime Minister and himself in relation to their attempt to get Mr Jones out of his seat to provide the vacancy for Senator Evans. Senator Evans knows that Mr Jones has some detailed records of this matter. In fact, there is an implied threat in the article written by Barker&mdash;on behalf of Mr Jones one suspects&mdash;that, unless the heavies of the Labor Party lay off Mr Jones, those records might come into the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that background we asked Senator Evans today what the story is. Of course, the language changes again. For the first time he said, `Well, there was fleeting, passing reference to a diplomatic post'. So we know that in discussion about this seat the issue of a diplomatic post was raised. We have gone from no inducement to there being mention of it during an earlier conversation&mdash;but not in relation to Mr Jones's seat&mdash;and from there to now having on the record that reference to a diplomatic post was made in the discussions between Senator Evans and Mr Jones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? What does a `fleeting, passing reference' mean when Senator Evans is asking Mr Jones to vacate his seat in favour of himself? Everyone knows what that means.

That is a very serious matter and one that needs to be explored at much greater length. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill is desperately trying to flog some life into what is a very dead horse indeed. The truth of the matter is this: Mr Jones was not at any stage asked to resign his seat. The question was raised with him, as honourable senators might have expected, in the context of interest in these matters arising from the redistribution in Victoria as to what his intentions were so far as the next parliament was concerned. Mr Jones was asked whether it was his intention, when his tenure expired in the natural course of events at the next parliament, not to go on for another term, given that he would be 62 or 63, I think, at that stage, or whether he was determined to run again and to seek preselection accordingly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, in the context of that conversation the question arose as to what Mr Jones would do with the rest of his public life or his professional life in the event that he did choose to stand down and not seek preselection for the next term of parliament.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, some discussion took place about, as I said in question time today, the possibility of utilising Mr Jones's talents&mdash;not necessarily through a government-paid or public sector job at all&mdash;in a way that would utilise his obvious capacities for thinking, for talking, for articulating about the nature of Australian society. We discussed, for example, the report that had just come down from Mrs Kirner's committee about the proposal for a COAG, a Council of Australian Governments, appointed position running the centenary celebrations and whether that was something that Mr Jones might, if he were to step down from politics, be interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a discussion of that kind; it was purely general.

But it would not be sensible to even begin to talk about that until after the government is re-elected because, obviously, it would not be possible for this government to make any commitments about what any subsequent government could enter into.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Jones responded, as I recall, to that particular proposition by saying, `Look, I'm basically not in the slightest bit interested in that kind of job anyway. I see my future as working basically out of Australia and, really, I'm not interested in doing anything other than staying in parliament for another term.' That was effectively the end of that conversation&mdash;end of argument. That is the beginning and end of it. It was a private conversation addressing that range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a later stage&mdash;some days later&mdash;a further point was put to Mr Jones, which point has become the subject of some public controversy, about a different option for him that, since he was determined to stay in parliament, it may be that he would be interested in helping the party in another way by taking a different seat for what seemed likely to be his last term in the parliament. It was in that context that further conversations took place which have been the subject of a good deal of public speculation, a good deal of huffing and puffing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is not even the beginnings of a comparability between this situation and that which arose in the New South Wales parliament. Mr Metherell was specifically offered the situation, `If you resign in the middle of a parliamentary term, your job right now, you will find yourself occupying a particular Public Service job'&mdash;one that is normally filled through a process of advertisement and choice of someone on merit in a competitive environment. That context was not even one, as I recall, of offering a traditional job that is the subject of executive discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that there is a long and perfectly honourable history in this country of people who have had a distinguished career in parliament and in public service through the parliament moving on after the natural effluxion of their time in such a parliament to take various kinds of appointments. It has occurred over and over again on both sides of politics. It has occurred through us in the context of a willingness to put people into these positions from the other side of politics, if they have done a good job during their career. It is a practice that I fully believe should continue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It has already been established quite well that Mrs Kirner has made application for payment from the Victorian parliamentary superannuation fund of an extra amount of $360,000. The reason for this is that she was in poor health, which had forced her to leave the parliament. She has made application for that enormous amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new job to which Mrs Kirner has been appointed pays $104,000 per year. Not only does the job pay well but also it gives her a travel allowance of $300 per night, access to a government car, first class air travel and an annual trip for her spouse. The job is comparable to a senior executive position. The nature of the position would indicate that there would be a degree of hard work and, indeed, a good degree of travel around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health problems that Mrs Kirner claimed invalided her out of the Victorian parliament were back problems and tendonitis, as detailed in this morning's edition of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>. I put it to the Senate that these health problems are not going to be alleviated by long hours in a plane or a car, as will be required of her in her new position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either Mrs Kirner is in poor health, as witnessed in her application to the super board, or she has minimised those health problems in the portrayal of her true position to Minister Crean. Yesterday in the other place, Mr Crean indicated that Mrs Kirner's new position will be `a full-time activity in the first couple of years at least'. As I have indicated, a job of this type is comparable to one in the senior executive service and would entail a great degree of hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us leave aside for the moment who the appointee is in this case. The coalition, far from indulging in personality politics, is simply interested in wondering whether the government is going to get good value for money in this appointment. Would a senior executive who had previously suffered health problems be allowed to take up another senior position? I put it to the Senate that the answer is that that person should not be allowed to take up that position. Part of the criteria for the suitability of a person for jobs such as these must be whether or not the applicant is capable of sustaining the rigorous schedule that is necessary to perform the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer, Senator Gareth Evans concentrated on the  qualities that Mrs Kirner brings to the job. That debate will be one for another day. One quality which Mrs Kirner will need to cultivate is the ability to communicate the same message to interested parties&mdash;that is, to tell the truth. Either Mrs Kirner is ill enough to warrant the extra $360,000 payment or she is in such good health that she can take on a demanding senior executive job with this government. Senator Evans dodged this issue totally during his answer to me. We can only await a more specific answer when the matter is raised again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Crean also said that he wished the coalition would concentrate on real issues of importance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION  LAWS  AMENDMENT  BILL  (NO. 3)  1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures which give effect to certain announcements in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 Budgets and the Working Nation White Paper of 4 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regional headquarters</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Working Nation the Government announced a number of measures aimed at enhancing Australia's attractiveness as a regional headquarters location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include the provision of a wholesale sales tax exemption and credit for imported used computer related equipment, tax deductibility of certain costs of locating regional headquarters in Australia and a removal of withholding taxes on certain dividends distributed through Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives in this bill will improve Australia's attractiveness as a location for the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters of large transnational corporations including Australian companies. These complement the measures already put in place and first announced in the 1992 One Nation statement to promote Australia as a viable offshore banking centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regional headquarters measures contained in this bill should provide a climate that attracts and retains multinationals without compromising the integrity of our taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will help Australia become an expanded financial centre of the region and so integrate more closely with the Asian-Pacific growth economies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to revenue of the measures is likely to be around $40 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation of Australian branches of foreign banks</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes new taxation measures for the Australian branches of foreign banks. The new taxation measures were announced on 18 June 1993 in the Banking Policy Statement issued by the former Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new measures will recognise for taxation purposes intra-bank loans, derivative and foreign exchange transactions between the Australian branch and the foreign bank. Non-resident interest withholding tax will be applied to interest treated as being paid by an Australian branch to the foreign bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals also treat part of a branch's funding from all sources as equity, through the application of a notional equity requirement. The amendments also provide for revenue and capital loss transfer between the Australian branch of a foreign bank and its wholly owned Australian subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In implementing the decision to allow foreign banks to operate in Australia through branches, the Government has given careful consideration to the taxation measures to apply to the Australian branches of foreign banks. This has been a complex process involving extensive consultation with the banking industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the consultation process, the Treasurer released draft legislation and explanatory notes dealing with the proposed taxation measures. The industry comments were carefully considered and taken into account in preparing the branch banking provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures are estimated to cost the revenue $10 million in 1994-95, $15 million in 1995-96, and $20 million in 1996-97 and 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Social Security payments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home child care allowance and dependent spouse rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "with child" dependent spouse rebate for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and dependent child or student is to be abolished and replaced with the new home child care allowance from 29 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will remove a taxpayer's entitlement to the dependent spouse rebate where the taxpayer's spouse qualifies for the home child care allowance. The amendments also exempt home child care allowance payments from income tax and exclude the payments from the separate net income test for rebate purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also alter the current zone rebates, and rebates for members of the defence forces serving overseas and in the United Nations armed forces. This is necessary to ensure that these taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the abolition of the "with child" dependent spouse rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the provisional tax rules are also necessary to ensure the correct rebate entitlements are used in the calculation of provisional tax for 1994-95 and later years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the bill provide that where the spouse of a taxpayer qualifies for the home child-care allowance then the taxpayer will not be entitled to claim the `without child' dependent spouse rebate through the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the government considers that families should be able to fall back onto the `without child' dependent spouse rebate if they qualify for that rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the government will be moving amendments in this place to allow taxpayers to claim the `without child' dependent spouse rebate instead of claiming for the home child-care allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Partner allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 29 September 1994, the amount of job search, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit paid where the recipient has a dependent partner is to be split between the two partners. The recipient will continue to receive the allowance or benefit at half the former rate and the spouse will receive the partner allowance, paid at the same rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the tax law are necessary to give the partner allowance the same tax treatment as other comparable social security allowances and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact on revenue of removing the dependent spouse rebate is a gain to revenue of $360 million in 1994-95, $870 million in 1995-96 and $1050 million in 1996-97. These gains are offset by outlays on the home child care allowance. The cost of introducing the partner allowance is not significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deductions for bequests of significant cultural value made to certain institutions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow an income tax deduction for a testamentary gift of property to specified funds, authorities and institutions under the Cultural Bequests Program, announced last year by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also exempt the gift from the application of the capital gains tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total deductions to be approved under these provisions will be capped at a notional cost to revenue of $2 million per year, commencing in the 1994-95 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reportable payments system</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments designed to increase the level of compliance within certain industries. The amendments will introduce a new reportable payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like the prescribed payments system, the scope of the reportable payments system will be prescribed in regulations. Initially the proposed system will apply to certain payments within the fishing and the clothing industries where a high level of non compliance has been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed system, a payee who is receiving a reportable payment may quote his or her tax file number to the payer. This quotation will form the basis of reports provided by the payer to the Commissioner of Taxation. The information will then enable the Commissioner to match and verify the declared income of payees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a payee chooses not to quote his or her tax file number, the payer will be required to deduct an amount from the payment. The amount to be deducted is consistent with amounts currently deducted from investment income, prescribed payments and salary or wages, when a payee's tax file number is not quoted. Amounts deducted will be forwarded to the Commissioner and credited to the payee on assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased revenue from these measures is difficult to quantify. This is mainly due to the difficulties in estimating the precise level of tax evasion and the behavioural changes that will result from the introduction of the reportable payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government estimates that increased revenue of up to $100 million per annum will be collected as a result of the introduction of the reportable payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign investment funds and controlled foreign companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia now has a comprehensive system of taxing foreign source income. The first two parts of this system were the foreign tax credit system and the controlled foreign company measures. The foreign investment fund measures which took effect from 1 January 1993 constitute the third and final part of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures have been kept under constant review in order to rectify any difficulties which arise in the course of their operation. The bill contains amendments necessary to fine tune the foreign investment fund measures and align them properly with existing provisions, particularly the controlled foreign company measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures have a minimal effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Eligible investment fund income of registered organisations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will include in the assessable income of friendly societies and certain other registered organisations income derived from certain assets of the organisation. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions of Division 8A are not circumvented by the holding of assets separate from the eligible insurance business of the organisation. The amendment is in response to the full High Court decision in Independent Order of Oddfellows of Victoria v FC of T.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply to income derived on or after 1 July 1994 by a registered organisation from eligible investment assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to reliably estimate the revenue impact of this measure; however, the measure has the potential to prevent a significant future loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Provisional tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes amendments to retain the current provisional tax uplift factor of 8 per cent as announced in the 1994-95 Budget. The uplift factor of 8 per cent will be applied to 1993-94 incomes for the calculation of 1994-95 provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure defers $170 million of revenue from 1994-95 to 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation:  Reasonable benefits limits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the provisions relating to reasonable benefit limits that apply to concessionally taxed superannuation benefits. The reasonable benefit limit provisions apply from 1 July 1994. The proposed amendments will overcome a number of technical deficiencies with the new provisions and ensure that the provisions operate as intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply from 1 July 1994 and have no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care centres</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1993, to make child care more affordable, the Government introduced amendments to provide certain exemptions from sales tax to child care bodies. In general, to obtain funding for a child care centre and thus access to the sales tax exemptions, the centre must be outfitted and operating. This raises the issue that the goods needed to set up the centre will not be exempted from sales tax. The bill will introduce a new credit ground to allow such bodies a credit of sales tax for goods to be used in the provision of child care where the goods are purchased before a body is approved for funding. The credit will apply from 24 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further issue has arisen with certain child care bodies purchasing luxury motor vehicles free of sales tax. Although there are few occasions where the usage of such a vehicle will meet the criteria for exemption, it is not the Government's intention to allow bodies to gain this level of exemption at the cost of child care. It is proposed to limit the sales tax benefit in the purchase of motor vehicles to the sub-luxury component of the value. Thus the value above the luxury vehicle limit will be fully taxed. This restriction will apply to purchases from tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of these amendments on the revenue will be negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Streamlined sales tax review</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of the new sales tax on 1 January 1993, the Australian Taxation Office, in conjunction with business and other affected parties, has been reviewing the operation of the tax. The Government has been pleased to find that the vast majority of provisions are operating very well. However, there are some that would be best handled by legislative amendment. The overall cost to the revenue of these initiatives is expected to be small.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, where <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">faulty goods are replaced free of charge under warranty,</EMPHASIS> a credit is allowed for the tax borne on the replacement goods. If the defective goods are later repaired and sold, a clawback of the credit, proportional to the price received, is obtained. At present no allowance is made for tax paid parts used in the repair. The law will be amended to reduce the clawback by the amount of tax borne on the parts used in the repair. The amendments will apply to sales of defective goods from today.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a burgeoning industry in <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">repairing goods for overseas owners</EMPHASIS>. It is also developing a market for used Australian goods which have been refurbished. The law will be amended to allow a credit for parts, fittings and accessories used in the repair, renovation or upgrading of goods to be exported, provided the tax is not passed on in the price of the alterations. The credit will apply to tax borne on parts used after 1 January 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and the ACT in 1994-95, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council Meeting of 25 March 1994. The bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1993 and its provisions will have a similar effect as the provisions of that act. The Explanatory Memorandum was presented on 29 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current estimate of the general purpose funding for the States and the Territories to be appropriated by the bill is almost $15 billion, or around 12 1/2 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1994-95. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth Budget and, in combination with the Loan Council Allocations for borrowings by all levels of government agreed at the Loan Council Meeting, they have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centre-piece of the 1994 Premiers' Conference was the agreement that financial assistance grants to the States and Territories will be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years. That is, financial assistance grants will be adjusted each year not only for inflation but also for total population growth in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement reached at the Premiers' Conference will deliver a level of funding that is significantly higher than States and Territories would have received if the real terms guarantee that applied from 1991-92 to 1993-94 had been continued. This will assist the States and Territories to make further improvements to their budget positions. It is important for all levels of Government to make further progress in reducing their deficits over the medium-term in order to augment the public sector's contribution to national savings. The outcome of the Premiers' Conference will also provide considerable financial certainty to the States and Territories and should therefore represent an opportunity to focus on longer term policy challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each State and Territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants. It is currently estimated that financial assistance grants will amount to around $14.1 billion in 1994-95. The distribution of this assistance is determined using per capita relativities provided by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its Report on General Revenue Grant Relativities, 1994 Update, and estimates of population by State and Territory as at 31 December 1994 as determined by the Australian Statistician. It was agreed at the Premiers' Conference that the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission would be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to the States of around $516 million on current estimates. Of this amount some $183 million is in the form of one-off transitional special revenue assistance of which the Commonwealth will fund directly approximately $103 million and around $80 million will be funded from the pool of financial assistance grants by the States and Territories. The remaining $333 million of special revenue assistance relates to payments to New South Wales and Victoria under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare Agreements. When these arrangements were first introduced at the 1993 Premiers' Conference, it was agreed that in 1994-95 the Commonwealth would halve its contribution to the Medicare guarantee payments. At the 1994 Premiers' Conference it was agreed that, for 1994-95 only, the Commonwealth would continue to maintain its level of funding of these payments in real per capita terms, at a total estimated cost of $111 million in 1994-95. This represents a significant financial benefit to the smaller States. The balance of $222 million will be funded from the pool of financial assistance grants. The ACT will receive an additional $66 million for transitional allowances and special fiscal needs as recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and will be paid from the Appropriation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994-95 the Government will provide $350 million of identified arterial road grants to the States and Territories. These funds will be distributed on the basis of the average of the arterial roads allocation over the three years to 1992. In 1995-96 and 1996-97 the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to the movements in financial assistance grants. These payments replace funding that was provided under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 prior to 31 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was the case last year, the Higher Education Funding condition will again be an important feature of this bill. The bill, in conjunction with Section 25A and the proposed Section 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, provides for grants to be made for financial support for student organisations in circumstances where the Education Minister is satisfied that a State or Territory, by its actions, has affected the ability of the higher education institutions to provide such support as they see fit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories receive financial assistance on the condition that they will reimburse the Commonwealth for any grants made under section 25A or the proposed 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. If this condition is not fulfilled, the Treasurer may reduce the financial assistance grant to a particular State or Territory by the amount not reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State and Territory Governments and the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is continuing the debate from last evening on the subject of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, a bill which makes a number of housekeeping amendments to the SIS Act and to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. During that debate I commented on the government's most recent amendments to clauses 34 and 35. Clause 34 is amended with the object of authorising the disclosure of protected information or protected documents to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to clause 35 allow officers of the ISC to provide protected information or documents to the tribunal, but only where that information or those documents could be used by the tribunal in the performance of any of its functions or exercise of its powers. Protected information relating to the personal affairs of an individual will not be disclosed by the ISC to the tribunal unless it is in the public interest, that is, it is reasonable to do so in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What disturbs me is that what may be in the public interest of a minister for political purposes may not necessarily be in the public interest from an impartial assessment. Therefore, I seek an assurance from the advisers to the minister that, when such a disclosure is made, it is made on the recommendation or through the officers of the government advisory body, the ISC, to ensure that it is initiated from that area rather than from, say, a minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst that measure acts as a protective mechanism, I seek an assurance from the minister that the government will look at the further protective mechanisms which I suggested last evening. When a member makes a compliant to the tribunal, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission must be required to obtain an authorisation from a member permitting personal information to be given to the tribunal. This will protect not only consumers but also the ISC in the event of a dispute as to whether it was reasonable to disclose the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to draw to the Senate's attention one further matter arising from the presentation of this bill. I remind the Senate that amendment bills are not necessarily the only way in which the SIS Act can effectively be amended. The ISC has power under legislation granted by this parliament to modify provisions of the act, either temporarily or permanently, under part 29 of the SIS Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concern, certainly in relation to issues of a permanent nature, that perhaps these really should be not in the form of a modification order but in the form of an amendment to the act or some measure whereby the parliament itself has the ability to scrutinise these particular modification orders. It does have substantial power to change the intention of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC's power to make such modification orders, in effect, is to amend the legislation without reference to the parliament. It is true that it has to be gazetted, but it does not, for example, have to be placed before parliament in the form of a regulation. This amounts to a delegation of parliament's legislative power to a government agency without a legislated requirement for review. However, I take this opportunity to say that the ISC has conferred with me, as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Superannuation, in relation to modification declarations, and I have invited members of the committee, if it is convenient, to attend all such meetings. This process is necessary, given the power of these modification orders to substantially act, either temporarily or in a permanent way, on that power which has previously been determined by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC has already exercised this power on a number of occasions by issuing modification declarations and temporary modification orders. In praise of the ISC, these declarations have actually reflected the flexible attitude of the ISC in responding to industry needs and concerns. You, Mr Deputy President, need no reminding that these are necessary. As we are well aware, the ISC has announced numerous initiatives to facilitate the transition of superannuation funds to the SIS regime and some of the initiatives will be addressed in modification declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While agreeing to modification order No. 1, I still think it is a responsibility to bring it to the Senate's attention. That modification, taken to have effect from 1 December 1993, relaxes the strict application of the rules in the SIS Act which require public offer funds to have independent trustees so that employees of a professional fund trustee may become members of a public offer fund operated by their employer without jeopardising their employer's status as an independent trustee of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the subject of that modification is undoubtedly a good idea and again illustrates the willingness of the ISC to consult the super industry and heed its concerns, again the question arises: is this the best way it should be done? The declaration essentially enacts a new section of the SIS Act. That is the effect of it. I believe the Senate should look at this issue from two points of view. Firstly, the section will have general and open-ended application to public offer funds and their trustees; and, secondly, it does not contain a sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that this particular modification order should have been included as an amendment in the bill which is before the Senate, and that is why I use this occasion to raise that matter. I remind the Senate that it is a gazetted item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the ISC for its briefing last week on the government's latest amendments. I also commend the Commissioner of the ISC, Mr Pooley, for responding so quickly to a number of issues that have arisen in recent months, some of which are reflected in the legislation which is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that my time is nearly up, I remind the Senate that the coalition will not be opposing the bill or the amendments introduced by the government. I believe they are timely housekeeping matters in relation to what I refer to as threshold-type legislation which will be of widespread benefit by providing strong prudential standards for superannuation and protecting the rights of members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 which we are currently debating, as Senator Watson said, contains a number of technical and finetuning amendments to that landmark piece of legislation&mdash;the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act&mdash;passed by the Senate last November. The original SIS Act established a strong prudential supervision regime for the superannuation industry in Australia. The need for such a prudential supervisory system had already been established by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in its various reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to remind all senators yet again that it was an Australian Democrats initiative which set up that superannuation committee, but it was one which quickly gained the support of all parties. The committee and its work start as a high water mark of what can be achieved by a strong Senate committee acting in a cross-party way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today finetunes the original legislation in various technical ways, clarifying the rules relating to guarantees, in-house investment, approved deposit funds, appointment of custodians and retirement of trustees, provides trustee arrangements options for public offer funds, and modifies disclosure provisions. The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 is also to be amended to allow exempt public sector superannuation schemes, which are mostly state government funds, to become subject to the tribunal. I wish to speak on only two aspects of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one is the amendment to allow exempt public sector superannuation funds to come under the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. As I understand it, the provision will allow the states to refer the power to hear complaints arising out of their superannuation funds to the Commonwealth and its single purpose tribunal. I think that is a welcome initiative. I know that in Queensland, my home state, the only appeal against a decision of the trustees is a case to the Supreme Court. That requires expenditure of several thousand dollars simply to exercise a right of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Commonwealth should encourage all states to refer their complaints resolution powers to the new low cost tribunal. I understand that the four smaller states intend doing this under this amendment, but the two largest states, New South Wales and Victoria, do not intend to do so. If this is the case, I think it will reflect very badly on what I consider to be the already poor performance of those two states as employers on superannuation issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two years both New South Wales and Victoria have moved to radically reduce the entitlements of their employees for superannuation. For example, in New South Wales the original and sloppy&mdash;I think it was sloppy&mdash;attempt to abolish the rights of 70,000 employees to join the old state superannuation scheme without notice was thrown out by the courts. That is why I say it was sloppy. However, in its place what could be called a shonky deal between the Fahey government and the Carr Labor opposition then allowed the reduction of superannuation entitlements for new employees to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government has followed the New South Wales model. Based on creative accounting practices, the Victorian government managed to mix up the issue of its grossly overstated, unfunded superannuation liability with the issue of state debt. In the process, the Victorian government has run roughshod over the rights of its employees, both existing and new. It has rewritten unilaterally its employment contract and, on at least three occasions, breached federal law. On 22 June my colleague Senator John Woodley dealt in detail with the curious case of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner's finding of the three breaches and his decision, after consulting the Treasurer, to forgive two of those three breaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Federal President of the Australian Services Union, Mr Tony Touhey, is seeking to have the issue raised at next month's ALP National Conference. But given what has happened, at both state and federal level in both those states, I really do wonder about the role of some Labor members of parliament and their professed concern for the welfare of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Democrats remain extremely concerned about what has been and is being done to the superannuation rights of Victorian public servants. Senator Watson said Commissioner Pooley had responded promptly to several requests for information. I want to know from Senator Watson why Commissioner Pooley has not yet responded to the complaint from Victorian workers of the fourth breach of federal law by the Victorian state government. This concerns the complaint by state government employees about the coercive tactics used by the Victorian government to force people to leave the old super scheme and join the revised scheme. That might sound like a good idea but the problem is that these employees will face benefit reductions of up to 20 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confer with Senator Watson when I have finished speaking. I will move on to the second issue which deals with clause 26. Clause 26 seeks to amend section 66 of the principal act, which governs the acquisition of assets from members of superannuation funds. The original section 66 was easily the most controversial of the clauses in the original SIS Act. Given the careful balancing of the issues in the superannuation committee's report on the section and the subsequent compromise amendment in this place, we must look with particular care at the proposal to restrict further the section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original clause was designed to allow those small business people who felt that they were capable of running their own superannuation schemes to do so, but not in such a way as to provide tax shelter status to their ordinary business or income. In my speech during the second reading debate on the original bill last year, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the government has argued that clause 64&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>now 66&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will close a significant tax avoidance provision whereby members transfer assets into superannuation at a concessional tax rate. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, small business groups, the Law Council and the accountants association have argued that the government is seeking to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer.</PARA>
<PARA>We just want to be reassured that the clause, as it was originally drafted, cannot adversely affect smaller superannuation funds. There appeared to be an assumption that members of small funds were incapable of running their own investment funds without engaging in tax avoidance&mdash;in other words, that tax avoidance was their primary motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current amendment will restrict the operation of this section to assets of the fund member's principal business. I need to ask a few questions about that. I wonder whether in some respects this might not be going in the opposite direction of what the government says is needed. For example, where a small business person runs a small business but owns an investment property, he or she cannot sell the investment property to the superannuation fund. Why does the government think that this achieves the purpose that it seeks?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish my comments by welcoming the important finetuning provisions contained in this bill to improve the operation of the complaints tribunal, but I urge the government to get its house in order. Two months after the tribunal was supposed to be operational&mdash;I think I am right in saying this&mdash;the secretariat is still not fully staffed and a chair is yet to be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But more worrying than that is what I see as an insurance industry-led push to have complaints arising from personal superannuation accounts moved from the jurisdiction of the tribunal and placed under the privately run industry complaints body set up by LIFA. That is a totally unacceptable reduction in the tribunal's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that an independent, low cost government complaints system is far more likely to produce fair results than the tamer industry self-regulation complaints body. Where would it end? If we take this model, will we then say that banks can insist that complaints relating to their super funds be referred to the greatly restricted Banking Ombudsman? I urge the government to resist any restrictions on the tribunal's jurisdiction, at least until the tribunal has had a chance to sort itself out and find its feet. </PARA>

These are not in the order that Senator Watson dealt with them because his contribution was in two parts. The issue of requiring at least one member representative trustee to be a member of the fund is a matter that Senator Watson flagged. The current act requires many funds to have member representatives on their trustee boards. For many funds the SIS Act requires there to be equal numbers of employer representatives and member representatives in charge as trustees of the fund. I am not sure whether Senator Watson is still the trustee of a fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood you to be trustee of another fund, but that might not be correct. In the past I was a member nominee or trustee of a fund. It is an important requirement because it gives fund members a say through their member representatives. Member representatives do not have to be members of the fund; that is the point that Senator Watson is making. For example, they can be an appointee of an organisation representing the interests of members, such as a trade union.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Watson does not object to that. I also point out that employer organisations can nominate representatives on the trustee board on the same principle. Nothing prevents a fund from requiring members to be the member representatives on the trustee board. However, requiring all funds to have members, as opposed to single member representatives on the trustee board, could cause difficulties for some funds in complying with the equal representation requirements. For example, in some funds it may be difficult to find members who wish to be trustees. Certainly the responsibilities, if anything, are much more onerous and the obligations required are much greater because of the types of legislation that the government has been presenting to this place and we have been passing. At this stage we still believe that, on balance, the current provisions should remain as they are. I certainly can see Senator Watson's argument, but it could cause difficulty for some funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point Senator Watson raised related to requiring an authorisation before releasing certain protected information to the complaints tribunal. One of the government amendments to the bill will allow the ISC to provide protected information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I do not think there is any argument with that as a procedure. Senator Watson has requested that a restriction be placed on the circumstances in which such information could be provided to the tribunal. If the information is personal information, Senator Watson believes the ISC should be required to obtain an authorisation from the person involved to release the information to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be unusual, though not impossible, for protected information to include information relating to personal affairs of an individual. The ISC would not release any personal information it has, such as details of the complaint made to the ISC by a particular member, to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal unless it was reasonable to do so in the circumstances&mdash;for example, where the release of the information would aid in a speedy and fair resolution of a complaint before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will note that the government has made a public commitment to this effect in paragraph 6 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Again, I think this is something that we can observe in the operation of the legislation to ensure that the government commitment in the supplementary explanatory memorandum will be met, as I am sure it will. There will be other opportunities for senators&mdash;and this would apply to their other concerns&mdash;who are sufficiently aggrieved by the procedures to suggest and foreshadow amendments in this place, given there is a fair flow of legislation affecting superannuation. For example, I understand that a bill to be introduced later on in the year will affect this legislation with respect to small amounts. So there are opportunities to move amendments if this bill is not applied reasonably and fairly and the assurances are not kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue concerns the disclosure of protected information for political purposes by the minister. It is the government's intention that permanent and temporary modifications be reviewed prior to the expiration of those temporary modification orders on 30 June 1996. Consideration will be given to formalising those amendments to the legislation. We are not doing it here today, however. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot raised three issues that I wish to respond to. Firstly, she drew attention to the division 3 amendment concerning public sector superannuation funds coming within the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal if the states or the territory confer that responsibility on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I understand that most of the states&mdash;not all but most&mdash;wish to place their superannuation funds under the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not everything, I know. But the states had a particular view, as they invariably do on these sorts of issues, that they did not want the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal vis-a-vis our legislation covering them. It could have been a difficult constitutional point, I think, given some possible question mark over jurisdiction in this area, as we would affect the states. But, suffice it to say, I think it is useful that states have of their own volition come to the realisation that the most practical way to deal with disputes is to have a dedicated tribunal deal with these specific issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that Senator Kernot raised was the appointment of a chair to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I am informed that Senator Kernot will have an answer to that concern by the end of this week and that that appointment will be notified very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue Senator Kernot raised related to section 66 of the act. I understand that evidence has been given to the committee on this matter. I am not aware whether or not it is with respect to a referral, but the reason for the amendment to section 66 of the act is that it prevents the trustee or investment manager of a regulated superannuation fund from intentionally acquiring assets from members of the fund or relatives of such members. There is an exception, however, which allows such assets to be acquired provided certain criteria are met. These criteria are that the fund is an excluded superannuation fund; the asset acquired is business real property or a listed security; the asset is acquired at market value; and the total value of assets so required after royal assent does not exceed 40 per cent of the total fund assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment clarifies the operation of the exception by requiring that the business real property so acquired can be acquired only from the principal business of members or relatives. This ensures that members cannot avoid the intent of the prohibition by arranging their assets in a manner which readily allows access to the exception. The exception recognises that in certain circumstances acquisition of a member's business assets may benefit the fund and the member's retirement income but at the same time recognises the dangers from a prudential retirement incomes and taxation revenue perspective in the fund acquiring assets from members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment aims to ensure that the right balance is struck between allowing the acquisition of such assets but recognises the dangers in such an approach. It does this by clarifying the operation of the exceptions by requiring that the business real property so acquired is acquired only from the principal business of members or relatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were the issues that I wished to comment on in responding to the speeches made during the second reading debate. A number of other matters were touched on as invariably superannuation legislation provides an opportunity for senators to comment generally about other matters affecting superannuation.

Provided that the authorisation decision is made in good faith and in accordance with other administrative law principles, the minister does not require the ISC Commissioner's consent to exercise the power to authorise disclosure under section 346(6)(e).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to answer that question now&mdash;and the answer is no. The Democrats support this legislation. The Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Bill is the latest in a series of bills which have begun to internationalise the proceedings of Australian courts and tribunals. In this context it is significant that the bill will allow, with Australian proceedings, the issuing and enforcement of Australian subpoenas in New Zealand, the taking of evidence by video link in New Zealand and the enforcement of judgment of Australian courts in New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disappointingly, the powers to issue subpoenas have been restricted to other than criminal and family proceedings. I understand that the legislation has been framed in this way at the insistence of the New Zealand government. Perhaps the minister at the table could explain why the New Zealanders have adopted this particular position. Whatever the reason, it does produce a disappointing result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very proceedings where the subpoena procedures could be most useful and potentially productive of the greatest savings, these will be unavailable. This in turn will restrict the effectiveness of the video link procedures in family law and criminal cases given that it will not be possible to compel a witness to attend at a video link facility to give evidence. I do hope the government will exert whatever pressure it can to get the New Zealand government to change its stance on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the video link procedures, the bill, under the reciprocal scheme established by clauses 25 and 31, would pick up relevant state law and apply it to proceedings sourced from New Zealand; however, I am not aware of any state rules  or procedures that would govern the taking of evidence from overseas. I am aware that in the context of the child sex tourism legislation many concerns were raised about the use of this sort of technology in criminal proceedings. I believe that some of the expressed concerns were to an extent overstated; however, state and territory governments are going to have to think hard about the issue. It is disappointing that the federal government has not sought to give some sort of lead and establish appropriate benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the thrust of the Sackville report, and with the recently introduced evidence bill, uniform procedures in this area would be desirable. It would certainly make things simpler for the New Zealand authorities, who are going to have to supervise the taking of video evidence for Australian courts. The bill does provide in clause 47(3) that in the absence of relevant state rules the rules of the Federal Court will apply. I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in the interests of efficiency to meet with his state counterparts to put in place a uniform scheme which would govern video link procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this bill also throws up yet another example of how our laws discriminate against single sex couples. The Democrats are committed to the principle of ensuring that homosexual couples are treated equally before the law. They should be given the same advantages and suffer under the same liabilities as heterosexual couples who are married or who live together as de facto husband and wife. In the context of legislation such as this, the recognition of this equality is of great importance as it confers equality of status and treatment within our legal system. This applies whether it is a benefit that it confirms or a liability that it imposes. I refer to the definition of a de facto couple in the definition section of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had correspondence with the Attorney-General on this matter and have suggested that, in line with the stated policy of the government to achieve equality in these areas for all Australian citizens, we should seek to amend this. I have offered to move the amendment&mdash;in fact, I have submitted a draft amendment to the government. However, I appreciate that on this occasion an agreement had to be made with the government of another country, namely New Zealand, and that the government was constrained by the attitude of that government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of this consideration, seeing that the purpose of the whole bill is to achieve some sort of uniformity and the government clearly was not able to move the government of New Zealand on this point as on others&mdash;I have mentioned the family and criminal law areas&mdash;I have decided not to move the amendment. I simply urge the government to continue  negotiations with New Zealand. We should strive in all our pieces of legislation, all our acts and all our statutory provisions, to achieve equality for all Australians, irrespective of their sexuality. As I have said, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally Senator John Herron would be taking the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) through the Senate on behalf of the coalition. It is appropriate to put on the public record that he is not here to do that because he is using his medical skills in Rwanda to assist the people in that area. It is a great credit to this Senate that we have someone who has those skills and is able to use them in this way. I am very proud, especially as a senator from this side of the house, that Senator Herron has seen fit to offer his services in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 makes amendments to a number of acts within the human services and health portfolio. It proposes amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986, the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953 and the National Health Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. I have often stated in this chamber that we spend a considerable amount of our time here fixing up drafting anomalies and it is something which should not happen as often as it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the legislation. There are three main parts to the bill. Firstly, it tightens control over pathology services in terms of both supervision and locations. Secondly, it allows a level of Medicare benefits to be set by regulation without reprinting in the schedule of the act. Thirdly, in relation to pharmaceutical benefits, it restricts the eligibility of persons to safety net concession cards for pharmaceutical benefits and provides for brand substitution by pharmacists of drugs or medication prescribed by doctors in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity has been taken also to make a technical amendment to section 4(1AA) of the National Health Act 1953 in relation to the rendering of a pathology service in a hospital or day hospital facility, substituting the term `patient' for`in-patient' wherever it occurs. The amendment removes an anomaly that exists currently in the act. The pathology amendments correct anomalies and they clarify the supervision definition for the rendering of pathology services. They restate the original intention of the pathology licensed centre collection scheme and remove the redundant references to temporary pathology collection centres, since these licences ceased to exist on 1 January 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with the supervision of pathology services. The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides the legislative basis for the payment and administration of Medicare benefits in relation to medical and hospital services. These proposed amendments seek to tighten control over pathology services by defining the meaning of supervision. Medicare benefits are payable only if the services are performed or given on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The proposed amendments dictate that a pathology service will not attract the Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged proper supervision of that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 3AA(3) states that proper supervision has been arranged if the approved pathology practitioner ensures that a properly qualified person supervisors the rendering of the service and has personal responsibility for the proper rendering of that service. The purpose of proposed section 3AA is to enable the minister to provide for the definition of adequate supervision of pathology services rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The question of whether proper supervision is provided is to be decided in accordance with the written principles which will be determined by the minister. According to the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is that these principles will be modelled upon National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council standards and applied using currently accepted practice for the approving of premises as accredited pathology laboratories. New subsection 3AA(5) provides for the determination of the principles to be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area covered by this bill is the location of pathology centres. The second area of tightened control is in relation, as I said, to the location of collection centres for approved pathology authorities. The bill replaces the existing section 23DNB with a new section 23DNB which incorporates and adds to the old section. Again, the explanatory memorandum notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to allow the Minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed section 23DNB(3) provides that the minister must determine in writing the principles with which she must comply in performing her duties under that section. The bill provides that these principles must include a formula or other method for allocating entitlements, the circumstances and method for varying an allocation, and the number and location of collection centres that can be operated under the entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of concern in Australia about the access of people in rural and isolated areas to a fair and equitable health system. When this bill was debated in the House of Representatives, the coalition sought an undertaking from the government that the minister would act to alleviate the hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. Dr Theophanous, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, has given an undertaking that the principles will address the need for collection centres in rural and isolated Australia to allow fair access by people living in remote areas and that the government will develop the determination in consultation with the profession. I reiterate the call from the Senate that Dr Theophanous and Dr Carmen Lawrence ensure that these issues are addressed and that people in rural and isolated areas are not disadvantaged by any of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, I understand the proposal is that provision should be made for the use of the allocation in operating licences on a one for three basis in rural and remote statistical local areas, as defined by `rural other' and `remote other' in the January 1994 Department of Human Services and Health publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural/remote areas classification</EMPHASIS>. The coalition accepts the government assurances on this matter, but it is also aware that, as a disallowable instrument, the minister's determination is subject to tabling and disallowance so the parliament will have an opportunity to examine the matter in detail at that later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main thrust of the bill concerns the table of fees. The level of Medicare benefit which is payable for a particular service is calculated on the basis of a lengthy table of fees. The purpose of the amendments to section 3(1), sections 4 and 4A and schedules 1 and 1A of the Health Insurance Act 1973&mdash;the act&mdash;is to avoid the need to reprint the lengthy schedules in reprints of the act, as the content of the schedules is printed regularly in the form of regulations under the act which annually provide for the making of, or amend, the general medical services table and the pathology services table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to these proposed amendments, the relevant tables were in the schedules to the act. Schedule 1 related to general medical services and schedule 1A related to pathology services. The bill omits the provisions requiring the tables to appear in the schedules to the act. Instead, the bill provides that the level of Medicare benefits will be set by regulation alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third main thrust of this bill is in the area of pharmaceutical benefits. It makes two changes to the legislation governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The first gives effect to the decision announced in the 1994-95 budget to restrict the issue of safety net concession cards to persons eligible for Medicare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments relate to the National Health Act 1953, which establishes the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and ensures that pharmaceuticals are provided to the general public at a maximum of $16 per item. Where an individual or family spends more on pharmaceuticals than the safety net figure of $400 a year, any further prescriptions are provided at a reduced rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be noted here that this was not widely publicised. A member of my family was quite surprised when she got to the $300 limit and thought that she was now going to get her pharmaceutical benefits at the reduced rate only to find that the limit was going to be $400. So the government is very good at singing its praises about the good news but it is not so keen to actually notify people about something that is of concern to them but which the government would rather them not know quite so much detail about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme also provides safety net concession cards for some patients, including pensioners, the unemployed, low income families, veterans, and war widows and their dependants. Eligible recipients pay $2.60 per prescription until their annual expenditure reaches $135.20. After this safety net level has been reached, pharmaceuticals are provided at no cost to the cardholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes an amendment to ensure that the safety net concession cards will be available only to people who are eligible to receive Medicare benefits. Such eligibility to receive Medicare benefits is generally extended to Australian residents and certain members of diplomatic missions. The restriction of the safety net concession card to Australian residents is estimated to result in a savings of $0.4 million in 1994-95 and $1 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has expressed concern at the lack of reimbursement for the extra workload imposed on pharmacists by this bill. The guild argues that under the new legislation, as an additional step, pharmacists will be required to sight the Medicare card, to transcribe the Medicare number and to forward details to the HIC for eligibility. The Pharmacy Guild is concerned that pharmacists will also have to explain to patients why concession cards have been denied and try to recover from patients the difference between the concession and the non-concession prescription cost. Alternatively, the pharmacists will have to charge non-concession prices and then refund the difference when cards are validated. Dr Theophanous in his second reading speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not up to pharmacists to police Medicare details. When patients go to have a prescription filled out, it is their duty to declare whether they have validity under the Medicare arrangements, as they do now when applying for a safety net card. I do not think it is going to lead to a significant increase in the work done by pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA>Time will tell, but the pharmacists have said one thing and the government has said another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change to the legislation governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme permits brand substitution by pharmacists, subject to conditions agreed to by the Australian health ministers conference. The main proposal is to amend the National Health Act 1953 so as to allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication that is marketed under a different name from the drug or medication specified in the prescription written by the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the proposed amendment is to allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic product for a branded one, which will mean that in many instances it will be cheaper for the patient. This can occur only when the patent for the branded product has run out and generics are being manufactured. When a branded product is prescribed, the patient is required to pay a premium for the product, which on average is between 50c and $1. There can be a definite preference by individuals for a product with which they are familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substitution will be allowed only in the following circumstances: firstly, if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified branded drug or medication is to be supplied; secondly, if a schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent; thirdly, if a ministerial determination allowing the substituted generic drug or medication to be marketed under a particular brand name is in force; and, fourthly, if the supply of the substituted brand is not prohibited under state or territory law. This change has resulted from an agreement between state and Commonwealth health ministers concerning rules under which pharmacists dispense medication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes have been supported by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia has stated that the bill's proposals do not appear likely to have any significant impact on the pharmacy profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has expressed concern about two issues in the legislation. The first concern is with the term `equivalent'. One of the conditions required to be met before substitution can occur is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits issued by the Department states that the specific benefit and the substitute benefit are equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA>The current practice is for the department to identify products where brands have demonstrated bio-equivalence to the satisfaction of the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, through the addition of an appropriate identifier in the pharmaceutical benefits schedule. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has argued that the use of `equivalence' has a much broader meaning than `bio-equivalence'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is related to co-marketed products. There are a number of instances where the same pharmaceutical product is marketed as two or more separate and distinct brands with separate marketing and PBS listing approvals, co-marketed by competing pharmaceutical companies. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is concerned that the legislation as currently drafted could allow pharmacists to substitute one brand of such products for another, even though consumer premiums under the minimum pricing policy, which the amendments are intended to allow consumers to avoid if they so choose, are not charged in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these concerns the coalition does not oppose the bill but notes the need to monitor the operation of the new provisions to ensure that the sorts of concerns expressed by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association are not forthcoming and that pharmacists are not given an additional load, as they claim. Indeed, we will be watching that closely and discussing it with those professions to ensure that this does not happen and that the system works as intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) amends a number of acts within the human services and health portfolio. The Australian Democrats do not have any problem with this bill and, indeed, I do not intend taking up much of the Senate's time this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only two areas I particularly want to mention. Firstly, the Democrats support those provisions which tighten up controls over pathology services. Basically, these provisions, which are largely procedural, correct some anomalies and clarify the supervision requirements for rendering pathology services. Medicare benefits are only payable for pathology services where the service is performed or given on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to obtain approval under the Health Insurance Act a pathologist must provide undertakings to the minister&mdash;and this bill extends those undertakings to incorporate the pathologist arranging `proper supervision' of the pathology service, including ensuring that a properly qualified person supervises and is personally responsible for rendering the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether the practitioner ensured proper supervision of the service will be decided in accordance with principles determined by the minister&mdash;and those principles will be disallowable. I note that the explanatory memorandum indicates that these principles will be modelled on the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council standards, which means that the principles set down by the minister should be acknowledged and accepted by pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also clarifies the original intention of the licensed collection centres scheme and removes the now obsolete references to temporary pathology collection centres, which ceased to exist earlier this year. In 1991, when the government started fixing the number of licensed collection centres which pathologists could operate, it argued that the growth of centres was contributing to a fairly significant blow-out in pathology costs. That thinking was understandable, if not entirely correct, but one result of this policy has been the closure of a number of pathology collection centres in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that some of these centres should have closed, but there is equally no doubt that the residents of other rural areas have been significantly disadvantaged by the closure of their local centres. The government, to its credit, has recognised this problem and has now proposed that, when rural and remote areas are concerned, one licence could cover three centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to acknowledge that pathology is an area where there has been some blatant abuse of taxpayers' funds in the past. Even now there are suggestions that a small number of pathology services are looking for&mdash;and indeed may have found&mdash;ways around the new provisions. So it is a question of balance for the government; a question of balancing the need to tackle pathology overservicing with the requirements of people living in rural and remote areas to make sure that they have reasonable access to pathology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the bill that I want to mention concerns the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The first change gives effect to the decision announced in this year's budget to restrict safety net concession cards under the PBS to persons eligible for Medicare benefits. What this means, in effect, is that the concession cards will be restricted to Australian residents. While non-Medicare cardholders will still be able to benefit from the subsidised drugs available under the PBS, they will be unable to take advantage of the further subsidies which cut in once the safety net is reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change will allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication&mdash;that is, one which is marketed under a different name from that specified in a doctor's prescription. The substitution will be allowed only when a number of criteria are met, and these are: firstly, where the doctor has not specifically indicated on the prescription that substitution is not to occur&mdash;in other words, the doctor instructs the pharmacist via the prescription that no substitution is to be made; secondly, where the drug prescribed and the drug supplied are listed as being equivalent by the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health; thirdly, where there is a ministerial determination in force allowing the substituted drug to be marketed under a particular brand name; and fourthly, where the supply of the substituted drug is not prohibited under state or territory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a welcome and long overdue move, and I note that it is supported by Pharmacy Guild which has correctly pointed out that pharmacists are more than capable of advising on lower priced equivalents. This represents the final step in the Commonwealth government's generic drug use policy, and we believe that it is a sensible and necessary step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was ridiculous to have a minimum pricing policy while saying at the same time that we were opening up the pharmaceutical market to competition; yet still having a situation where patients did not have a real choice about purchasing the cheaper generic equivalent to the drug prescribed by their doctor. I have had letters from pharmacists and individuals complaining about the fact that unnecessary costs were being incurred because the pharmacist could not substitute the cheaper generic equivalent of the prescribed drug. I know that many pharmacists were very unhappy about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were unhappy about the impact on pensioners and other financially disadvantaged patients; they were unhappy about having to contact the prescribing doctor before they could make any substitution; and they were unhappy because they felt&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;that their training and experience was not being recognised in this particular area. This change is not only a step forward for patients, but it also has some potential&mdash;as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Theophanous, has noted&mdash;to give the government some additional muscle in negotiating reasonable PBS prices with the pharmaceutical companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may even lead to some changes in the way in which pharmaceutical companies advise doctors of their products. The Democrats commend the government for taking this step. We also commend and congratulate the many pharmacists throughout Australia who have put patients before profit and have lobbied for this change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. As Senator Patterson and Senator Lees have said, it seeks to amend a number of services being provided to people throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area on which I wish to focus has predominantly to do with problems in the provision of rural health services because I have some real concerns about this legislation which I seek to have alleviated by the minister during the course of this debate. While the coalition supports the bill, I have concerns with respect to some aspects of the area of pathology reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to pathology services will be implemented through necessary amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. With these amendments, pathology services will not attract a Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged for proper supervision of the service, and the question of whether or not proper supervision is occurring will be decided in accordance with written principles set out in determinations which can be disallowed by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek some assurances from the minister in this regard because for a number of years I have been concerned that rural health services and the maldistribution of practitioners, including specialists, in Australia have been of great concern to health planners and providers. What we saw in recent years with the pharmacy restructuring authority would lead to more concern as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us will allow the minister to influence the location of pathology centres to ensure, supposedly, that remote or economically disadvantaged areas will have access to pathology collection centres. Those two things combined are flashing a few lights in my mind: are we going to be making it more difficult or are we going to make it easier for those in the country to have greater access?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the bill's explanatory memorandum this change will `alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres'. I hope that the profession is not hand-balling this across to the government and getting the government to make hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Invariably when government buys into the final decision as to where something is going to be located some of those communities are very seriously affected. Under the new subsection 23, the minister will be required to allocate annually to each person who is an approved pathology authority individual units of entitlement to operate licensed collection centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three mandatory provisions will apply, and they are: firstly, the formula for calculating units of entitlement for approved pathology authorities; secondly, the circumstances under which units of entitlement can be varied and the formula for calculating such variations; and thirdly, the number and location of licensed collection centres operable under a unit of entitlement. At first blush this seems to me a very helpful move, but history certainly shows us that government intervention in areas of locating medical services&mdash;whether it be a collection centre for a pathology authority or a pharmacy&mdash;has been fraught with a lot of danger. During the pharmacy restructuring time in Western Australia a number of pharmacies closed and in some cases people had to travel for hundreds of kilometres before being able to have access to their first pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having sat through all of the public hearings of this particular committee that looked at the pharmacy restructuring authority, I am concerned that we do not set up a system whereby similar problems will occur again. The rationalisation of pharmacies was certainly highly problematical. The aim of the scheme was to restructure the pharmaceutical program whereby rationalising the number and distribution of retail pharmacies throughout Australia was thought to be beneficial. What developed during that time was that a few pharmacists&mdash;and I have to say a very few&mdash;decided that they could make a quick buck out of it and blow the patients. It did not matter what the patients had to suffer as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was flawed. I am very keen to make sure that this legislation is not flawed. There is always the question of who is going to be responsible for the accuracy of information on which the minister makes the decision. That was an issue that applied to the pharmacists and is bound to apply to the question of pathologists as well. It is my fear that this could happen in remote areas where there is insufficient feedback, and those areas will either gain or lose collection centres purely at the decision of the minister who may well have never visited that area and may well not know whether it is a developing area or not. Once again I speak from experience of the way this has happened in many country centres throughout Australia with the pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may also be loopholes as there were with the restructuring of pharmacies because, inevitably, loopholes lead to rorts. The inherent danger is when the medical professions, or people in any business, get into bed with the government. I think we should be very much aware of those dangers to make sure that that is not going to happen as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a huge problem in attracting suitable health personnel to the rural communities and retaining them there, and this is now becoming a long-term problem right throughout the country. It is one that has to be addressed very quickly because it is really getting to the stage now where many of those country people are having difficulty accessing a variety of medical services. A number of those rural areas have experienced, and continue to experience, difficulties attracting the adequately trained general practitioner, particularly to isolated areas and to areas where sole practice is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take an area such as the remote parts of the north-west of Western Australia, that is particularly so. Therefore, we have to be sure in any legislation that is passed through this parliament that there will not be further disincentives put in the way of making sure that there is access for those country people to a range of medical services. While many of them would simply love just to have a general practitioner, we have to be aware that a lot of those country people have no access or little access to specialist facilities, and I categorise pathology as one of those very specialist facilities that are desperately required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the whole area of general practice, we see that the professional difficulties faced by the rural general practice work force have been well canvassed through many major reports. It has been highlighted again and again. In fact, I am not too sure, Mr Acting Deputy President, whether it was you who raised this particular issue about country rural medical services the other day in the parliament, because I know that you too have a great interest in the facilities and services provided to country people throughout your state of Queensland, as I do in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) today, I will first make some general comments in relation to the matter of the quality and the affordability of health care for Australians&mdash;which is very much a current matter and which I raised this afternoon in question time with the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Crowley. Honourable senators will recall that I asked her a question about the effective co-payment which is being introduced by the Minister for Health, Dr Lawrence, as a result of her refusal to increase the rebate to general practitioners by more than 15c. This has meant that those doctors&mdash;and it is pretty well all of them in Australia&mdash;who, over the last year, have seen their costs rise through labour and other costs, are now in the position where their income coming from the government bears no relationship whatsoever to either the costs of medical practice or the consumer price index.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about that, not because I am here as an advocate for the AMA or for doctors; I am here because I am concerned about the quality of health care in Australia. Sadly, what I believe will be the result of the government's intransigence on this matter is that some doctors will decide that they will no longer bulk-bill. The people who will not get bulk-billing are likely to be the battling families&mdash;particularly the people in the bush&mdash;and the independent retirees. Those are groups for whom I feel particular concern. They are not cardholders and they may well be the people who fall to the bottom of the pile. If their doctors do not bulk-bill, they will have to pay an increased amount of money to their doctor and there will be more of that uninsurable gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get the Uriah Heeps on the other side from time to time wringing their hands and talking about the need to do something about the gap, but it was their government when it came to office that abolished the ability of Australians to insure for the gap. So what is going to happen is that, despite the wails, the wringing of hands and the projects of the previous minister for health, former Senator Richardson, to do something about the gap, we now have a minister for health who is making the problem of the gap, in terms of medical treatment, much worse. So these battlers and the independent retirees who have carefully husbanded their resources on which to retire and those in the bush who are suffering so badly from drought are likely to be the ones who will be hurt most in their pocket and for whom medical care may become more and more of a luxury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for those who are cardholders, I do not believe that they will come out unscathed from the minister's actions either. What we will see is production-line medicine&mdash;the very worst kind of medicine. The rebate system is already so slanted that those doctors who want to give longer consultations do so at the cost to their own pockets. It is a system which is not designed for the best quality of medical care and as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, so many patients will go to a doctor and only start to get comfortable about the second matter on which they wanted to consult when it is time to be ushered out the door. People do need to feel comfortable and to establish some rapport or relationship with their doctor before they get to the more sensitive issues. They may start off with an ingrown toenail, but they will move on to more personal matters later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that we are going to end up with production-line medicine instead of the quality of care which the minister, Dr Lawrence, keeps telling us she is firmly committed to targeting. Unfortunately, we have to judge her by her actions rather than her words. This failure to properly remunerate GPs will mean that the patients inevitably are going to end up with a reduced quality of care from doctors who are already hard pressed in terms of poor remuneration for the work done. I have often heard the AMA President, Dr Nelson, talk about doctors who get out in the middle of the night to go and visit patients for something like $38.70. I do not think there are too many plumbers or other tradesmen who would get out of bed in the middle of the night to go and ply their occupation, but it seems to be all right for the government to expect that of doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announcement was that it intended to increase Medicare rebates or refunds for GP consultations by only 0.625 per cent from 1 November this year. That means that a doctor who bulk-bills will have had, over a two-year period, a 30c increase in payments for a standard consultation, and that Australians who are paying doctors' bills are seeing their rebates increase at a rate far below that of inflation and their reasonable expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should all be concerned about this because for most of us general practice is the basis of our wellbeing. Most of us see our GP on a fairly regular basis. Thank goodness, not too many of us end up in hospital with specialists. But it makes the issue of the remuneration of GPs and the resulting effects on their patients very much a national issue and an issue of real importance. It is a public health issue. When I say that GP rebates are only going up by .625 per cent in 1994, that is in the context of the CPI being expected to increase by 2.5 per cent and average weekly earnings by 3.5 per cent in the same year. That is how far the remuneration of GPs is slipping back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to a report of the Auditor-General in 1991. Talking about the administration of the Medicare benefits schedule&mdash;things have not improved too much since then&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developments in recent years would suggest that the scheduled fee simply represents the amount the government, having regard to budgetary and economic considerations, is willing to pay for the provision of particular medical services. It bears little or no relation to the actual cost of the provision of the services.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to remember that the majority of the costs of a medical practice are wages which cannot be discounted. The government would be the first to object if GPs around Australia were not paying their staffs the proper rate. Those wages cannot be discounted but apparently the government thinks that it can discount medical fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really feel quite incensed, not just for the doctors, but also for their patients who, one way or another, will end up bearing the brunt of Dr Carmen Lawrence's new form of co-payment&mdash;done through stealth and through the back door. In fact, I am astonished that members of the Centre Left&mdash;who were so prominent in giving their vote to the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to help him get his hands on the keys to the Lodge&mdash;have not risen up in wrath about this. Back in 1991 they were the ones strutting the national stage, saying how monstrous was the co-payment introduced by Brian Howe. We hear not a word from them now. Are those patients, those constituents, now all forgotten? Is it too far off an election, perhaps? Perhaps Mr Keating has them frightened. Perhaps people now have their promotions or their preferments and they can afford to forget their consciences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a particular aspect of the bill before us, and that is an amendment to section 103 of the National Health Act. It is the insertion of a new subsection which will allow pharmacists to legally substitute a cheaper, equivalent generic drug for a prescribed drug. I know that previous speakers have addressed this but it is a matter in which I am particularly interested because when I was serving as shadow minister for health I consistently argued for change in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember the substantial discussions that took place at an estimates committee hearing in August of last year. At that time I roundly scolded Senator Richardson because the government had had a policy for at least six years to implement generic substitution but had not got around to doing anything about it. To compound the offence, Senator Richardson was prepared to countenance a prosecution of a Wynnum pharmacist for effectively doing what the government had said should be able to be done. That was hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a couple of segments on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> which highlighted the hypocrisy of the government in this matter and the treatment of the pharmacist and his patients by the HIC. I am pleased that at last some action is being taken. Pretty heavy-handed action was taken on the Wynnum pharmacy issue; at last we are going to see some action here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read the House of Representatives debate on this bill and I share the observation of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile): it is somewhat ironic that at the same time as this bill is being debated by the parliament, the federal government, via the Health Insurance Commission, is prosecuting a pharmacist for behaviour that will be legitimised by the passage of the bill. I made the point at the estimates hearing that while the government might have had a minimum pricing policy, it was not doing anything about it. The summary provided to me by the department after that hearing said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the concerns of the medical profession and the fact that State law is important in this area, the Government's approach to encouraging generics via the 1990 policy change was the most appropriate rate of progressing the use of generics at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that there has been a significant increase in the use of generics since then, and that concerns about quality have been dealt with, it is now appropriate to consider moving to generic substitution as a way of making further progress.</PARA>
<PARA>The arguments for change&mdash;freedom of choice, competition and thus lower costs for consumers&mdash;are irresistible. In arguing for change, however, I have always been conscious of the importance of balancing the roles of the medical and pharmaceutical professions. In a speech in the Senate on 27 October last year I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless doctors have clearly indicated that there is to be no substitution, pharmacists should be able to talk to patients about the choice available between a brand name and a generic drug, in the cases where a generic drug is available, with obvious due and proper regard for bioequivalents.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment before us takes account of these conditions by specifying that substitution will only be allowed if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified drug or medication be supplied and the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent. I understand that the Australian Pharmacy Guild has welcomed this change and that the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia has accepted these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very glad that the AMA has also accepted the need for change in this area. I know that there were some doctors who were concerned about this issue. When I discussed the matter with them last year and into this year there was some concern that their right to prescribe could be diminished by any change to the law. I do not think that has been done in this case. I would want to know that, with monitoring, the level of their satisfaction and that of their patients will remain the same after the passage of this legislation. With the conditions attached to the generic substitution that I outlined, there can be no doubt that the essential prescribing role of doctors is appropriately protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that pharmaceutical manufacturers have raised some concerns regarding the use of the word `equivalence' in the amendment and about the issue of co-marketing. I understand that both of these issues have been addressed to the satisfaction of the manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I again say how pleased I am that the government has acted at last to bring forward amendments giving legislative authority to generic substitution. Although it has taken some time for the amendments to see the light of day and they will not actually take effect until 1 December of this year, it is nonetheless pleasing that the government has finally acted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those senators who made sensible contributions to the second reading debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. I want to address a few of the issues that are canvassed in the bill. The purpose of the introduction of the new section 3AA is not to diminish the role of the medical scientist but to recognise the importance of the medical scientist in the proper provision of pathology services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part recognises that there are a number of categories of laboratories that can and do operate efficiently where supervision is provided by a scientist or senior scientist. This notion is supported in the acceptance of these standards in the determination made by the minister under section 23DNA of the principal act for the approval of premises as an accredited pathology laboratory. These principles have been in place with the Commonwealth since 1987 and are based on standards set by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part recognises that although a scientist can adequately supervise certain categories of laboratory, a Medicare benefit can only be paid to a medical practitioner. Instead of the medical practitioner having to personally supervise pathology services, as required by the unproclaimed section 3AAA, the onus is on ensuring the medical practitioner takes personal responsibility for the proper rendering of services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This acknowledges that the medical practitioner may not own or even be physically present in the laboratory at the time of the service. Rather, the medical practitioner must accept the responsibility that all appropriate standards are in place and have been complied with during the provision of the service upon which a Medicare benefit becomes payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that in section 3AA, taking personal responsibility does not imply anything about ownership. Clearly, salaried doctors or visiting medical officers in public hospitals are responsible for their actions without owning the hospitals. As honourable senators can see, the new section 3AA should heighten rather than lessen the role of the scientist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles, who has kindly stayed to listen to this contribution, has asked for a commitment that people in rural and remote areas will not be disadvantaged by the bill. The purpose of these amendments is to provide an incentive for the pathology industry to reverse its commercial decisions that have resulted in the closure of rural and remote collection centres. The rural and remote licensed collection centre provisions of the Health Insurance Act were in fact reviewed in consultation with peak professional bodies. These consultations have resulted in the government proposing, as part of the minister's determination of the rural and remote provisions, to allow one licence to cover three centres in specified rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These areas are identified by the Department of Human Services and Health as `rural other' or `remote other' in its January 1994 publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural/remote areas classification</EMPHASIS> which has been based on the definition of the Australian Bureau of Statistics of statistical local areas.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments to subsection 3(1), sections 4 and 4A and schedules 1 and 1A of the Health Insurance Act 1973 . . . is to avoid the need to reprint the lengthy Schedules in reprints of the Act, as the content of the Schedules is printed regularly in the form of regulations under the Act, which annually provide for the making of, or which amend the general medical services table and the pathology services table.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think this parliament should allow a situation to develop where provisions are removed totally from legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the package of bills now before the Senate: the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994, the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994, and the</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994. These three bills, which have the support of the coalition, enable levies to be imposed on horticultural products at the request of the industry concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, horticultural groups wanting to raise money to fund research and development can do so through the Australian Horticultural Corporation and receive dollar for dollar funding. They can also call on the AHC to undertake promotion on their behalf. Groups paying and receiving the benefits of dollar for dollar grant arrangements include nurseries and producers of apples, pears, citrus, avocados, cherries, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, potatoes, onions and dried fruit. However, there is talk that the apple and pear growers will withdraw from the AHC. Presumably, those growers will no longer pay levies, undertake promotion or participate in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, each industry decides whether it wants to pay a levy. It can then set an amount and decide how that levy will be collected. Some industries charge on a per tray of produce basis, others on a per tonne basis, by the box or even by a levy on pot plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collected money is split between the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, according to the industry's particular requirements. As I mentioned earlier, the coalition has no argument with these bills. Various industries have asked for more flexibility so that the levies can be collected and disbursed in a more effective and cost efficient manner. However, the importance of these changes cannot be allowed to overshadow the fundamental problems facing the horticultural industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993 the then minister for primary industries set up a task force in response to an Industry Commission report to develop an export growth strategy based on the work of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The task force overview states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with tariffs on many horticultural products being gradually reduced, and the possibility of satisfying quarantine barriers to further domestic access, domestic producers will face increasing competition from horticultural imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With current planting trends and forecast production increases, both here and overseas, Australian horticultural industries will need to concentrate their efforts on developing and maintaining exports markets to remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition particularly agrees with the task force conclusion, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities which are developing, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are not limitless and will only be available for a relatively short period of time before the distribution systems are taken up by other countries. Australian horticulture has only a short term window of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>In the six months since the task force handed down its report, the government has failed to indicate where it is going with this report or what the outcome might be. Basically, the task force believes there is an urgent need for the industry to move away from the juice concentrate end of the market&mdash;where, frankly, Australia cannot compete&mdash;to the fresh fruit and fresh juice end.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force also recommends that the government exempt fresh orange juice from sales tax and that drinks with more than 25 per cent of juice be taxed at 11 per cent rather than 21 per cent. But, again, the federal government has failed to act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry already has a concessional sales tax rate of 11 per cent on fruit juices with 25 per cent or more local content, but this is to be abolished at the end of the year to comply with GATT. While the industry has accepted this position, it is still calling on the government to announce that from 1 January next year it will adopt the task force recommendation that 100 per cent juice containing no concentrate be exempted from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), told the other place recently, this sales tax is the government's own version of a consumption tax. The major difference is that the coalition was prepared to exempt food, including 100 per cent fruit juice, from its then proposed GST. Unless the government acts, Australians will pay 21 per cent tax on their morning glass of orange juice from 1 January next year. In other words, the existing 11 per cent plus a hefty 10 per cent rise. We still have no idea whether the government intends to adopt the task force recommendations, so we can only assume that the tax will rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the government has failed in its duty to undertake effective bilateral trade negotiations to open up new markets for our horticultural products. Too many of our products face obstacles in gaining access to international markets, including many Asian markets. There are bans, tariffs and a range of other barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there are no taxation arrangements, planned or otherwise, to encourage the horticultural industry to reduce its dependence on the domestic market and grow fruit for export. This is a very important point. From a Northern Territory and electorate perspective, I comment on the expanding and growing horticultural market of tropical fruits that has developed in the areas adjacent to Darwin and Katherine in the Northern Territory. I certainly hope that encouragement to these important industries and potential employment areas will be enhanced in the future by government. </PARA>

The report finds that, despite smugness about our economic performance, it would take only minor disruptions to trigger a financial crisis in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill, the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill. I have been over time in contact with the Western Australian industry. The message that is coming through fairly strongly is that levies are only as effective as the extent of consultation. I need hardly remind the chamber of the level of disturbance there was within the wine industry when a tax was imposed after only certain sections of the industry were consulted and, even then, only marginally. Even during the process, it was not until the last minute that somebody thought it might be useful to talk to people on the other side of the continent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia does exist and there are ways of going about problems which often arise in the industry in Western Australia and which are quite different and require a different approach. The government seems to consult only with the national bodies in respect of many of these kinds of issues. These national bodies are often representative of the eastern states and do not necessarily consult fully with their branches in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, I remind honourable senators of my remarks on 7 December 1993 in responding to a report on the functions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. I spoke about the fact that a levy charged on the gross value of farm gate production to farm marketing programs by the Australian Horticultural Corporation was not considered to be as useful by the Western Australian growers because it was geared towards specific marketing situations in the eastern states and not in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, because of the level of disquiet, efforts are being made by the Western Australian Fruit Growers Association to withdraw from the Australian Horticulture Corporation. The Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association voted to withdraw from the AHC, but it is having trouble at the moment as it might not be legal for it to do so. However, the fact that that association is currently attempting to withdraw from the AHC indicates the level of disquiet among that association's members about their standard of effective representation at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out by the Western Australian Fruit Growers Association that the majority of growers would support the HR&amp;DC levy. So the members of that association are not opposed to this particular type of levy. However, in view of the results of the apple, pear and citrus industry's involvement in the AHC, it would seem that many of its members would be unwilling for this association to be formed. The response from the executive officer of the Western Australian Fruit Growers Association is that its growers are unequivocally adamant that they want nothing to do with the AHC and are not prepared to recognise the Australian Fresh Stone Fruit Growers Association as their national peak body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that I know enough about the particular concerns that this association is expressing, but I think there is enough evidence that there is considerable disquiet in the industry from the Western Australian point of view. Therefore, when there is a move at a national level that is meant to benefit the industry&mdash;and it seems that this kind of levy is not opposed by the industry&mdash;in order for it to work and have maximum benefit, before such a levy is imposed there must be real efforts at consultation in the regions not just with peak bodies. One lesson which we have learnt again and again is that if we want schemes to work, the regions have to be part of and own such decisions. One way for that to happen is for those regions to be consulted effectively before such decisions take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, whilst we are not objecting to the levy and will not oppose it, we need to make the point that, not just from the Western Australian point of view but from the regional perspective, it is extremely important that those people putting together legislation and national bodies take the legitimate concerns of states and regions into consideration before making this kind of decision which involves collecting moneys from organisations within an Australia-wide industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994 seeks to raise a levy on certain horticultural products by a different method. I have no problem with the raising of a levy for research so that the government can meet its 0.5 per cent contribution towards research. What worries me is the way it is intended to go about raising this levy. In this case, also, Western Australia was totally ignored. I did a ring-around of all the bodies in Western Australia and I found that they were not consulted on this levy or the method of implementing it. I know that when Senator Margetts said she consulted with a Western Australia body I unkindly called out, `You were probably talking to Peter Sumich of AFLO.', but obviously she has been speaking to others and has picked up their points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, there are three acts that provide the means of raising industry funds to support national marketing and promotion through the Australian Horticultural Corporation. As Senator Margetts said, the Western Australian bodies wanted to pull out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tambling has pointed out already, the coalition will support the bill for the good reasons that he gave. What worries me is the way the government is going to go about it. These bills amend the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to enable levy to be collected on the basis of the area under cultivation or other horticultural inputs to the production process such as the number of trees, shrubs and plants. Then we have the presumed yield for those horticultural products to be specified in regulations. In other words, in regulations we are going to have a specified yield of crop. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regulations to be made to determine the presumed yield of leviable horticultural products or a class of products, presumed to be produced in Australia, by reference to several factors including:</PARA>

<PARA>Madam Acting Deputy President, you originally came from the country in New South Wales. I think you would understand that, when one plants a crop, one has no idea of what it is going to yield, even in the best of years, especially in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland with the wheat crop and the drought that is on now. No-one has an idea of yield when planting, let alone the presumed yield. Presumed yield is something like we had in this chamber with presumed income from pensioners' assets&mdash;that if they have so much money in the bank or have a house that they rent out, it is presumed that such assets yield eight per cent. We know that these days the yield on most such investments is around four per cent not eight per cent. I find it astonishing that anyone should work on a presumed yield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume furthermore&mdash;it was stated somewhere along the line, and I queried it with the shadow minister for primary industry&mdash;that the industry wants it. If the industry wants it, I question that more than if the government wants it. Because these so-called representative bodies that we in the field have set up in Canberra with our hard earned money do not necessarily reflect the wishes of the industry at all times, I question it more when they want something. I was told that the industry wants it rather than the people out in the field and certainly not the horticultural growers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look again at the explanatory memorandum and at the financial impact of this bill, I see that there is no financial impact. There is no extra income; there is no extra money going out. I ask the minister at the table: if there is a presumed yield on these variables which I have already mentioned&mdash;the number of trees, acres or whatever&mdash;how are we going to know how much is to be collected and whether the grower is telling the right story? Are we are going to have a team of inspectors going around counting trees, measuring up the land that is presumed to be seeded?</PARA>

I did not speak on this bill this afternoon just to waste time; I spoke to express a few more fears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that what I did for a living, and still do to a certain extent, is any secret to anyone in this place. I worked in the wheat industry. I am sure bank managers and those sorts of people would not mind a system of presumed yield when their customers were planting a crop. If they had lent money to farmers to plant a crop I am sure they would like a presumed or guaranteed yield. Unfortunately, in Australia in this day and age we cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My biggest fear is that this system may spread to other industries. Some secretariat minders of our interests in Canberra may think it is a good idea to come into the wheat industry or the wool industry and extract a levy on the number of sheep being run. Then of course we would have someone out counting the number of sheep or using satellite imagery to see how many sheep are being run. The idea is fraught with danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us say a person agrees with having a presumed yield on wheat&mdash;plants 10,000 acres and presumes it is going to yield so much. What happens when there is a drought like the one presently affecting the eastern states and the south-east of Western Australia? That person has had all those other costs and then has the levy on top. There is that to worry about. There may be a crop ready to take off and then there is a good hail storm which wrecks it altogether. At present, if the farmer is prudent, the crop is insured against fire and hail and if it is destroyed insurance is paid. To my knowledge, if there is an insurance payout a levy is not paid on what has been received as compensation. But here the levy has been paid, yet the crop may be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other sorts of problems. Even on this side of the country, people probably saw that, because of the extent of the drought in the pastoral areas of Western Australia, the emus are running down the emu fence, crossing over into the southern areas, getting amongst the crops and destroying them. All of those things can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have probably given enough examples of what can happen to a crop after it is planted. But another problem is that the price of the product may collapse. In 1991 the export enhancement program virtually halved the wheat price overnight. There was also the wool collapse of 1989. I think we are playing with fire in relation to presumed yields and a rate being paid on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could make it easier for some people&mdash;those sitting up in their kings' castles in Canberra&mdash;to simply put the levy on production costs rather than on the yield from a crop. What is wrong with the good old system of paying levies ad valorem? I certainly hope that neither this nor any other government would get the idea of levying tax on presumed income. That could be a further extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and on about what could happen. The ad valorem system is used in most cases that I know of. There are rates and taxes&mdash;local government rates and state land tax&mdash;and none of them are on presumed yield or presumed income from housing or presumed income from office space that is let. Of course, if there were a system relating to presumed income from office space that is let I think the Labor Party would do pretty well with Centenary House. We will not get into that debate at this stage, but I am giving examples of what might happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition has decided in its wisdom to support the legislation. I certainly do support it because every industry should have a levy that goes towards research and development. I believe every industry should carry its part of the load. The government is carrying its part by putting in a matching fund of 0.5 per cent towards research, but I believe that this method of collection should not spread. </PARA>

Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is for urgent and unforeseen matters. We have now had the budget down for just on two months. In relation to the area I have a particular interest in and responsibility for, the Department of Administrative Services, there are a number of calls on the Advance to the Minister for Finance related to the removal of the business services trust account in DAS to establish a separate trust account for Comcar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Advance to the Minister for Finance is meant to be used for urgent and unforeseen matters. It is inconceivable, it seems to me, that the department or the minister did not know at the time of the budget that this action was going to be taken. I assume it was a policy decision made a number of months ago. I would like the minister in the chamber to request an explanation from Mr Walker as to why we have this urgent call on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for a matter which, one would have thought, was a normal administrative matter&mdash;a matter which would have been considered in the normal budget process. The decision to establish a Comcar trust account having been made, one would have thought that an appropriate appropriation would have been made. I wonder whether it would be possible for her to seek an explanation from Mr Walker as to why we suddenly find, just two months after the budget, this call being made on the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wish to raise in relation to this is that part of the advance relates to the payment of redundancies for Comcar drivers. It is well known that Comcar has been undergoing a number of serious problems for quite a number of years. Each of the various ministers for administrative services has found it very difficult to deal with the problems. We have had a number of major twists and turns in the policy for Comcar, of which most senators and members would be aware. The losses in Comcar have been very extensive. I think for last year we had full accounts they were in the order of $18 million. It is quite appropriate that the government seek to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to Comcar drivers, there is great confusion and uncertainty about their future prospects. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that promises were made to Comcar drivers before the election. They were told by their union that, if they voted for the coalition, they would lose their jobs. We would have to say that, in the long legion of broken promises by Mr Keating, that was yet another one made. The union is responsible for this. I understand that the union told its members that, if they voted for Labor, their jobs would be secure. We are in the midst, as indeed this Advance to the Minister for Finance shows, of a major retrenchment phase. I point out the poor performance of the union involved and the misleading information it gave to its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly&mdash;and this is important, because all of us appreciate the services that Comcar drivers offer us&mdash;there is the great uncertainty and, indeed, confusion that many drivers feel about their future prospects as the government seeks to wind down the number of people involved. They constantly, and rightly, point out to us that, whereas drivers are being wound down, there does not seem to be the same sanction against supervisors. It is an issue which I am glad to have had the opportunity to raise in the chamber today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter arising from a debate held yesterday afternoon in this chamber. That debate centred on a motion relating to our Commonwealth Games athletes, specifically referring to Cathy Freeman. The motion was moved by Democrat Senator Meg Lees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to have the motion declared formal, the coalition was of the view that, like all formal motions of the Senate passed without debate, it should be non-controversial. For this reason, the coalition sought to replace the word `support' in the last clause of the motion with the word `understand'. This amendment was put to the Senate and lost on the voices. Then the original motion was put to the vote and carried unanimously, with not one coalition senator voting against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did Senator Lees do then? She went back to her office and put out a media release which would have to rate as one of the biggest beat-ups I have seen in a long time&mdash;even from the Democrats. The term `beat-up' is being a bit kind to Senator Lees because it may imply that there was some substance in her release that was capable of being inflated, but there was absolutely none.

That only confirms my suspicion and, I presume, the suspicions of a lot of my colleagues that Senator Lees, in moving this motion, had little interest in praising the magnificent efforts of Australian Commonwealth Games athletes, including Cathy Freeman's marvellous efforts. Her only aim was to make political capital out of moving her motion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a proud moment for all Australians as she is the first Aboriginal woman to win a gold medal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She has every reason to take great pride in her heritage and to carry both the Aboriginal flag and the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA>At no stage of that debate yesterday was that statement contradicted. In fact, the three coalition senators who spoke on this side, Senator Campbell, Senator Michael Baume and myself, were very concerned to ensure that we did nothing but praise the efforts of all Australian athletes who performed at the Commonwealth Games, including Cathy Freeman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees was sitting here in the chamber when the debate was held yesterday but obviously was not listening because she had pre-arranged her press release. She did not listen to one bit of what was said during the debate and was concerned only to promote her own personal point of view. In this grubby little political exercise either she chose to ignore the truth to try to make some extra political capital out of it, or she deliberately and wilfully misled the media with her statement, a statement which, regrettably, was run by a number of media outlets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one reporter contacted my office last night, Mr Adam Harvey of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I do not think it is any coincidence that Mr Harvey's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is the only report that I have read which comes close to reporting the truth of the matter instead of relying on Senator Lees's trumped up garbage. Senator Lees and her Democrat colleagues chose to try to regenerate their waning support by trying to appear more caring and more supportive of interest groups than either of the major parties. They think they have a monopoly on compassion, when in fact they only seek to highlight issues and matters which are potentially divisive in our community. The Democrats, and Senator Lees in particular, mouth the word `reconciliation', but in practice seek to highlight divisive issues in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a constant tactic of recent times of the Democrats to go whining and whingeing to the electorate about the way in which the nasty big parties bully them around. How has the electorate responded to this tactic? After drawing a few sympathy votes in the 1970s and 1980s, the electorate has become fed up with the Democrats and is turning away from them in droves. So, as the Democrats are faced with losing their party status at the next election and sinking into total irrelevance, we get the situation where Senator Lees, in a desperate and self-interested attempt to hang on to the benefits which she receives as deputy leader of her party, resorts to politicising the magnificent achievements of a fine athlete and name-calling members of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the Democrats' attempt to get tough and to shake off its whingers tag, it is, quite frankly, pathetic. I used to have a great deal of respect for Senator Lees, until yesterday. If the contents of her press release with the headline `Liberal senators don't support their leader' is the sort of tactic that she resorts to, that respect that I once held for her, I am afraid, is no longer there. Resorting to totally misleading the media with selective quotes, mistruths and untruths is sinking to the depths of despair of politicking and trying to make some political capital out of an issue of which we are all justifiably proud, namely, the performance of all of our athletes at the Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, in this chamber yesterday afternoon was wholeheartedly and totally supported by probably every member of this chamber. He chose not to politicise the event; he chose to make it one that unifies the whole of the Australian nation, and I congratulate him on that. To borrow liberally from the Bard, this press release told by a Democrat, is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. </PARA>

<TITLE>Paper: Sales Tax</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="613" SPEAKER="Coulter Sen J.R." NAMEID="TF4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on another matter. Some years ago I raised in this Senate by way of an amendment to a sales tax bill a proposal to remove the sales tax from paper made from recycled fibre. At the time that amendment was defeated by the combined votes of government and opposition, but shortly thereafter the government introduced its own legislation which removed the 20 per cent sales tax from paper made from recycled fibre. We, of course, supported that and that became the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992 budget the government, however, chose to put back the 20 per cent sales tax on paper made from recycled paper. That seriously disadvantaged some groups which in the meantime had invested large amounts of money to set up a recycling program. There was one company in Brisbane, and Austissue, a company in Western Australia, which had invested, I believe, some $7 million to set up a factory recycling paper and making toilet tissue and, in the process, employing some 40 people. So this change of government policy, this sudden about-face of government policy, was a severe embarrassment to those investors and to those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I went into a negotiation with the then Treasurer, John Dawkins, as a result of which in that budget it was agreed that, while the sales tax on recycled paper would be reimposed, a bounty would be payable to those Australian companies making paper from recycled fibre equal to 20 per cent in the first year. In other words, the bounty would exactly pay for the sales tax payable by those companies. In the second year that bounty would be reduced to 15 per cent, in the third year to 10 per cent, and then there would be a program for renegotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has transpired since&mdash;and this is the reason I am speaking tonight&mdash;is that Austissue, the company in Western Australia, sold semi-finished product to a company in Victoria called Felcro. That company believed that it would be eligible for the bounty because it was the company responsible for the sales tax, there being no sales tax payable on the intermediate product, that is, the product which passed between Austissue in Western Australia and Felcro in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to have happened is that the Western Australian company, Austissue, has taken the 20 per cent bounty and Felcro has been landed with the 20 per cent sales tax. This has resulted in legal claims by Austissue for payment from Felcro&mdash;which I understand has retained some of the payment owing to Austissue because it believes that it should have received the bounty&mdash;and a counterclaim from Felcro against Austissue for the bounty payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence and because the matter has landed in court&mdash;a matter which I thought was absolutely clear in the debates which led to the modification of that budget and the introduction of the bounty scheme&mdash;I thought it was appropriate for the Treasurer to indicate that the bounty scheme was introduced to exactly counter the sales tax to assist those companies which had set up as a consequence of that about-face in government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I wrote to John Dawkins when he was Treasurer, asking him whether my interpretation was correct. John Dawkins did not answer my letter. I wrote to him again. John Dawkins again did not answer my letter. I have subsequently written to Mr Willis. Honourable senators will realise, from the time Mr Willis has been Treasurer, that this correspondence has been going on over some considerable time; and, again, I have had no response from Mr Willis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have two Australian companies involved in the recycling of paper&mdash;a very important activity&mdash;and involved in very expensive litigation over the payment of sales tax and a bounty scheme. If anyone goes back and looks at the debates and negotiations that went on, they would realise that it should be sorted out very quickly at no expense whatsoever. We have the succeeding federal Treasurer failing in his duty to give a clear indication as to the interpretation of that agreement on bounty and sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this speech tonight as a further appeal to the present Treasurer to come out of the woodwork, go back and look at that agreement and write a letter indicating the correct interpretation of to whom the bounty should be payable. I believe it is clear that it should be paid to the company responsible for the payment of sales tax. It was quite clear in the negotiations that that was the intention. The Treasurer can save an enormous amount of heartache and costly litigation and sort this matter out once and for all. I appeal to the Treasurer to settle this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a very brief contribution to the adjournment debate relating to a most excellent article written by Christopher Pearson that appeared on page 13 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today. It sets out in some detail, yet very concisely, the important and fundamental principles that ought to be considered when the federal parliament deals with the legislation that the federal Attorney-General has threatened to introduce to override laws in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article by Christopher Pearson is entitled `Lavarch's Apple Isle adventure leaves sour taste'. It would be fair to summarise Mr Pearson's comments by simply quoting a very brief sentence which reads, `There is no local shortage of object lessons in the tyranny of centralised power'. Mr Pearson is saying that the view that if it comes from Canberra it is okay and it must be good is not necessarily appropriate and, indeed, there is nothing wrong with a degree of diversity in a diverse country such as Australia with diverse states in a federal system. The fact that Mr Pearson has come out on that side of the debate is very interesting, given that he starts off his article by establishing his credentials as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was present at the birth of the earliest successful gay law reform lobby. It was a typical Adelaide cabal of 20 years ago. Peter Duncan, then an ALP backbencher, had drafted a private member's Bill, but its passage through the Upper House was in doubt. Roger Knight, a historian, Peter Ward, now a senior writer with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> but then Don Dunstan's executive assistant, and I met to cobble together a list of prominent sympathisers.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't enter this argument lightly. Being discriminated against because of your sexual preferences is not something that anyone who has experienced it would wish on others.</PARA>
<PARA>It is against that background that Mr Pearson's entry into this argument is so very significant and so very helpful to those of us who believe that all wisdom does not reside in Canberra, but that all wisdom resides with the people of the various states and in their democratically elected parliaments to determine the appropriate social policy for their state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that Mr Christopher Pearson, the editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS>, should make his comments because there have been many arguments directed against my state and its government because it is somehow out of step with the rest of Australia. Sure, it is. That has to be recognised and accepted. But what also has to be recognised and accepted is that 20 years ago the state of South Australia was clearly out of step with the rest of Australia and it would have been just as obnoxious then if the federal government had said, `You are out of step with the rest of Australia. You are out of step with the rest of the world. We will therefore intervene and reimpose the laws because you somehow got it wrong.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very good to see that there are people of such principle as Mr Pearson who are willing to argue the right for the states to make their own determinations in relation to these matters, although it is quite clear from the article that Mr Pearson would reject and oppose the laws as they exist in my home state of Tasmania. That is the only contribution I wish to make to the debate tonight. It was a brief contribution, but I wanted to place on record my appreciation of that excellent article. I hope that because of my contribution to the debate a few more people, especially around this place, will take the time to read this most excellent article. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) decision to phase out the use of heptachlor and chlordane for termite control was based on the conclusions of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) "Inquiry into the use of the Organochlorine Insecticides for Termite Control", and the conclusions of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) report entitled "Cyclodiene insecticide use in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) ARMCANZ agreed to a Northern Territory proposal to extend by two years the phase out period in the Northern Territory in recognition of particular termite problems experienced in the Northern Territory. The extension of time is subject to the implementation of a strengthened audit of organochlorine sales and use, improved training and regulation of pest control operators, consumer choice of treatment methods, increased environmental monitoring and implementation of a new building code which includes alternatives to organochlorines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Queensland Government felt that the termite problem in north Queensland could be dealt with using a combination of improved building practices, physical barrier methods (eg stainless steel mesh or a bed of tightly packed granite chips) and alternative chemical treatments combined with under-slab reticulation systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In light of the compelling evidence from both the NHMRC and NRA reports, ARMCANZ agreed to the phasing out of the use of organochlorine chemicals as the most appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The alternatives to organochlorines that are currently available are chemical treatment with chlorpyrifos, and physical barriers such as crushed granite and stainless steel mesh. Improved methods of building are also available to facilitate easier and more efficient retreatment, such as the incorporation of reticulation systems into the concrete slab. Combinations of chemical treatment, physical barriers and improved building practices could also be used to achieve integrated termite management using a range of complementary control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Pest control companies can apply alternative chemical treatments at little or no additional cost to the company. These companies will generally not be involved in the installation of physical barrier alternatives which are installed by specialist franchisees in the case of "Granitgard", the commercially available granite chip barrier and "Termimesh", the commercially available stainless steel mesh barrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The NRA, has estimated that the alternative chemical treatment, chlorpyrifos, is around $200-250 more expensive than organochlorines in a new building. The physical barrier treatments also involve more expense than organochlorines in new construction (an added $250-300 for partial steel mesh, $2500-3500 for full slab underlay, and about $500 for crushed stone).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The residual life of organochlorines is estimated to be 20-30 years under ideal conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) CSIRO research has confirmed that chlorpyrifos may provide 4-15 years protection depending on soil and environmental conditions. The granite chip and stainless steel mesh barrier methods are expected to last for the life of the building, generally estimated as 50 years.</PARA>
