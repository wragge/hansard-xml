<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: why are Australia's long-term real interest rates, as measured by 10-year bond rates, now at their highest level in more than 30 years? What effect will this have on Australian business? Did not the government learn any lessons from the worst recession in 60 years?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One hopes that, as rats in a maze learn their way out after a period of time, even Senator Hill would learn some of the basic realities about the setting of long-term interest rates, which are not within the control of the Australian monetary authorities or the Australian government. They are set by the market and they have regard&mdash;or they should have regard&mdash;to the underlying fundamentals of the economy. Manifestly at the moment they are not. Manifestly they are having regard more to overseas developments and perceptions as to interest rates that seem likely to prevail and economic activity that seems likely to prevail elsewhere rather than to the underlying reality of the Australian scene and the predictions that all reputable analysts and economists are making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be building in&mdash;as these figures seem to&mdash;inflationary expectations of five or six per cent simply is against the run of all the objective analysis that is coming from commentators here within the system. The fundamentals just do not give rise to interest rates of that particular kind and there is no basis for those sorts of figures. So we just have to live with the reality of that figure being struck. But it has nothing to do with the government's deliberate decision making in the area of interest rate management; nor has it anything to do, as I keep saying, with the underlying fundamentals of the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government's policy is to deliberately force up interest rates in order to dampen demand as an alternative to tackling the deficit, is it not therefore surprising that long-term real interest rates are so high? I ask: what effect does the minister think this will have on Australian business? As I said, has not the lesson of the last recession been learnt, because in the run up to that recession what the minister was saying to us was exactly the same thing&mdash;it was the market and it was not government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator McMullan for that interjection because he was making the very obvious point that those opposite are talking about the Australian balance of payments situation and the budget deficit as being somehow a contributor to this; and yet every other country to whom he is drawing attention by way of comparison to Australia has a much higher deficit than we have in terms of the current account situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no rational relationship between long-term interest rates as they are prevailing now and the present condition of the management of the Australian economy, because the underlying realities of the Australian economy are that we have&mdash;as is constantly being said&mdash;the best conjunction of fundamentals for 30-odd years. The growth rate is fine. The inflation rate is fine. The level of investment that we are currently experiencing is fine. The wages situation is fine. There is no basis for these sorts of assumptions. Whatever has happened in the past in relation to short-term interest rates bears no rational relationship to the long-term situation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Over the past week there has been a great deal in the press regarding APEC-related activities in Jakarta. I understand that, whilst it has not been reported widely, during the minister's recent visit to Jakarta for the APEC ministerial meeting, a trade and investment agreement was signed with Mexico. Could he advise the Senate as to what this agreement will mean for Australian export, for investment and for jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3041" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Forshaw for raising this issue, which has been underestimated. This agreement with Mexico represents a major step forward in the commercial relationship between Australia and Mexico. It is the sort of international agreement that generates significant benefits for Australia and is the sort of international negotiation in the trade area that needs to be undertaken. Those who think we should in some way be withdrawing from international agreements fail to see the potential benefit these agreements can generate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an agreement which positions Australia to capture some of the benefits of the predicted rapid growth in the Mexican market. It provides practical benefit to Australian exporters and investors in two ways. There is a framework for the resolution of trading problems that might emerge between the two countries as our level of economic engagement increases. We both have relatively open economies but that does not mean no conflicts can arise. For example, Australian beef exports to the Mexican market have dropped dramatically as a result of the imposition in 1992 of a 25 per cent tariff on frozen beef. Of course, our competitors in the US and Canada do not face that because of NAFTA. There is also a complex issue, which I will not take up the time of the Senate with now, about our relationship with Mexico concerning sugar. Overall, we have a very positive relationship and a basis on which we can build.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement provides an opportunity to examine and develop new opportunities for trade and particularly for investment, because Mexico is becoming a country of major commercial opportunity for Australia and more and more countries are showing interest in it. This is the third aspect of this agreement. It has a demonstration effect. It says to Australian business, `This is a country to which you should be giving more attention. Here are some significant opportunities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mexico is an economy in which there has been dramatic economic reform. It is a country of 90 million people and with a GDP growth of 3.8 per cent. As it opens, so an increasing proportion of its economy is being serviced by imports. Our exports to Mexico have tripled over the past four years, but they are still very low. They are now $192 million, although, as I said, that is a tripling in the last four years. It has risen to be significant amongst our markets around the world, although it is still nowhere near the top of the list and nowhere near its potential, particularly on the investment side, where Australian businesses are just starting to look. We are getting some mining investment there. But even though exports are picking up, we are underperforming on the investment side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look for this agreement to be one of those aspects that will increase the priority in that, as is the decision&mdash;the very welcome and correct decision&mdash;by the department and by my predecessor to include Mexico as a focus market at the national trade and investment outlook conference. It is another demonstration effect raising the significance of this market in the eyes of Australian business, both for trade and investment, and is also a very practical way of making contacts for Australian business in Mexico and for allowing Mexicans to make contact in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also developing much more of a habit of dialogue and cooperation with Mexico as it comes into APEC and as it has now joined the OECD. This trade and investment agreement is significant directly for our trade and investment relationship with this increasingly important and underestimated economy. It is also a signpost of the way into the growing Latin American market, an area with one of the fastest rates of growth in the world and with significant political change going on, generating further significant opportunities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In view of the total inability of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to answer Senator Hill's very simple question asking why Australia's long-term interest rates now under this government are at their highest level in over 30 years, let me try another interest rate question on one of his junior colleagues. I ask it in the context of the OECD having recently predicted that Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates of any of its members in 1995. Is he aware that bank, housing and business  loans are now around nine per cent and rising? Is it not also a fact that real interest rates are above seven per cent and rising? Why are real interest rates so much higher than current and projected rates of inflation? Can he assure the Senate that interest rates on home loans will not rise over the next six months?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3042" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Short had actually listened to the answer provided to Senator Hill by Senator Gareth Evans a moment ago instead of interjecting at the top of his voice, he would have heard a quite clear and cogent explanation. The main feature of the explanation was Senator Evans accurately reporting that, of course, we do not regulate long-term bond rates in Australia. That is a feature of market activity, and as far as those in the long-term bond market factoring in inflation rises of the order in which they apparently are&mdash;between six and seven per cent&mdash;are concerned, there is no empirical evidence, nor is there any evidence among the economic pundits or the government forecasts, that such a level of inflation in Australia is at all likely or indeed tenable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it does leave a question as to why they do this, and do it in a speculative market. I must say I am somewhat surprised but, nonetheless, they do do it and it is a factor of the market&mdash;it is not a factor of government regulation. So the opposition cannot come to us as a government and say, `In this area that you don't regulate, you are responsible for the way in which speculators go about setting long-term bond rates.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates in Australia tend to be higher than the inflation rate, and that has been a long-term feature of the economy. I have often heard senators from the other side compare Australia with New Zealand and, on the basis that a conservative government applies in New Zealand, therefore New Zealand somehow or other attracts their admiration in preference to their own country. It is my understanding that interest rates in New Zealand are higher than interest rates in Australia and that that is a feature of its economy. This is an empty and vacuous question which has already been answered in the main by Senator Evans. I have nothing further to add.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I point out to the minister that since January this year Australia has experienced a rise of 65 per cent in long-term interest rates&mdash;the sharpest rise ever recorded, and a rise double that experienced by the United States over the same period. In view of the minister's complete failure to answer my first question, I ask: is the minister saying that, with his government's appalling track record on forecasting and on delivering economic results, the Australian community should believe his government's view on the nature of interest rates as opposed to the well-informed market's view?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that Senator Short should raise the question of our forecasting ability. I recall vividly that shortly after the budget was brought down, Senator Short joined in the chorus of other sceptics in Australia, arguing that the budget forecast on investment projections&mdash;a 14 1/2 per cent growth in investment for the budgetary year 1994-95&mdash;was impossible to achieve, or was unbelievable, and went on to rubbish the forecasts, as oppositions always do, to try to undermine the budget settings. But, of course, we are now seeing that we may have been in fact wrong in the sense that we may have underestimated the growth in investment in this country, because the figures that are coming through now&mdash;and given the latest predictions of the agency that Senator Short prefers to cite, Access Economics&mdash;show that our estimates are in fact realistic. Therefore, the opposition cannot have the allegation that it now makes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which comes into effect tomorrow. I understand that the convention will effectively double the coverage of Australia's territory, adding almost 15 million square kilometres of marine territory to our exclusive economic zone. I ask the minister: what implications does this convention have for our marine based industries and research institutions? What obligations or challenges does the acquisition have with respect to understanding and management of the oceans surrounding Australia and its territories?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for this question because it is important. Tomorrow, 16 November, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea comes into force, and the area of territory controlled by Australia will increase by 150 per cent as a consequence. The Convention on the Law of the Sea ensures that Australia can lay claim to territory 200 nautical miles from its coastline or to the edge of the continental shelf, whichever is the greater. That means that the area under Australian control will increase by 14.8 million square kilometres of ocean. This is a vast increase in the amount of responsible area in the world controlled by this country, and it imposes on us a huge responsibility. We will have sole rights of control and sole rights to exploit the living and non-living resources in this extra area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already put in place the necessary legislation earlier this year to define and create the exclusive economic zone, as it is called, and other marine zones to which we are entitled under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Our new maritime claim includes the seas surrounding Australia, the Antarctic and other territories out to 200 nautical miles or approximately 370 kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Australia also has sole right to seabed mineral resources on the sections of our continental shelf which extend beyond the 200 nautical mile EEZ. Our combined exclusive economic zone and continental shelf claims under the United Nations convention add up to 14.8 million square kilometres, which is close to twice the area of the Australian continent and is probably the largest ocean claim worldwide under this United Nations convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations convention effectively confers ownership to Australia on the resources in this exclusive economic zone and also allows us to host a host of other rights, including control over scientific research, cable laying and the erection of offshore structures. But the United Nations convention also demands that we manage this exclusive economic zone in a sustainable way to ensure that the living resources in it are not destroyed, depleted or irreparably harmed. The future economic and social benefits of our new offshore claims are almost certainly massive, but this is only an educated guess as there is still a small amount of knowledge about what the features are in terms of fisheries, oils, mineralisation, gas and other resources which may exist in this massive ocean perimeter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say, for example, that CSIRO predicts that by the year 2015 the farming of tuna fish in this area of ocean controlled by Australia will be worth more than the total value of the beef industry in Australia in terms of exports. The marine research will be essential for Australia to get a baseline study in place and work out how sustainably we can tap the huge potential of this area. The research we need to undertake is to be developed and conducted in close cooperation with industry environmental groups in the community, which ultimately own this area and will benefit or lose depending on how we manage it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know less about this area than we already know about the surface of the planet Venus, so there is a huge amount of work to be done in getting the baseline scientific studies correct. I am pleased to say that steps are being taken to do that and a major conference on this subject will be held in Canberra tomorrow. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I share Senator Kernot's concern about the mangrove clearing that is taking place in the Hinchinbrook Channel adjacent to the Port Hinchinbrook development. Since the clearing was first proposed and the deed of agreement for the development was drawn up, information has been made available to me and my department that gives us cause for grave concern about the likely impacts of the clearing on the seagrass communities that are adjacent to the site in the channel. These seagrasses are feeding grounds for dugong and are an integral part of the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the government has been doing, and doing effectively, is to provide a progressive response to what is regrettably a progressively deteriorating situation. As I advised the Senate the other day, and I can advise Senator Tierney now, despite the fact that the government's scheme has been operating now for only a bare four weeks&mdash;and I checked again this morning&mdash;applications for assistance under the scheme have now exceeded 4,000 and well over 2,000 payments have now been approved. They are being processed at the rate of around 200 a day, and the current approval rate is in excess of 90 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also advised the Senate&mdash;Senator Tierney was clearly asleep when I was doing so&mdash;that I would have discussions with my state colleagues, all of whom, I might add, supported this move, to develop a more scientifically based set of criteria upon which exceptional circumstances could be based. One of the difficulties in Australia at the moment is that the drought declarations are state government matters and the processes by which they are carried out differs widely from state to state. Indeed, a number of states have no drought declaration processes at all, which means that it is crucial to get a more uniform national response to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some significant progress was made on this at the ARMCANZ meeting recently held in Adelaide. I have been advised by the New South Wales minister for agriculture, Mr Causley, that an application will now be made from New South Wales for additional exceptional circumstances assistance, and I expect to receive that shortly. When I do receive it, it will be referred to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, chaired by Neil Inall, in the same way as other applications for exceptional circumstances are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect to the two points that Senator Tierney made about what would be without question a horror scenario of the drought not even breaking, on current predictions of the Meteorological Bureau, in autumn next year, I have repeatedly stated the situation that would be involved then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are, however&mdash;and I have said this before&mdash;that if the drought should not break by autumn of next year, if we do not get a substantial relief in what will then be the fifth continuous year of drought for areas of Queensland in particular, it will at that point have escalated to a major domestic crisis, not just for the rural community but for the whole Australian community. There is no question that the government at that point will have to examine the responses that will then be necessary, because the quantums of assistance that will then be required will be extremely high indeed.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The minister must have been the one asleep when I was asking the question, because I did not ask him a question about the welfare measures. I asked him a question about what he was doing to help support the rural farm and business units. Out in rural Australia the whole rural infrastructure and economy are now facing collapse because of his lack of assistance to the business units. So let me repeat that aspect of the question. Has the minister developed any comprehensive plans to assist rural farm and business units&mdash;let me repeat it: rural farm and business units&mdash;to survive the worst drought on record? Could he please tell the Senate what they are?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. It refers to her letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 4 November 1994 in which she asserted that critics of the government's family tax policy, quoted in Kate Legge's article, do not want genuine choice. If, as the minister states constantly, child care is a cost of earning income, why is it not also a cost for a one-income family in which one spouse cannot engage in paid work if the other does not care for the children? Why is one spouse not allowed to deduct for tax purposes, payments to the other spouse to care for the children whilst he or she does paid work? Where is the genuine choice when the fringe benefits tax exemption for child care excludes the care of a child in its own home by a parent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of Senator Harradine's question, as I understand it, concerns the different treatments for the payments for child care in the home, as opposed to payments for child care in formal child care arrangements. Quite clearly, there are ways in which this government has addressed those needs. The decision to assist with the cost of child care through child-care assistance, as Senator Harradine well knows, deals with the needs of low income families but the additional introduction of the child-care cash rebate this year goes to the recognition of two things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that child care is a legitimate cost against earning an income and, like any other cost against earning an income, it is non-income tested. Unlike other tax deductions, it is paid as a rebate to enable the costs of child care to be offset as they occur. Properly, like any other tax rebate, it is not income tested and recognises the cost of child care as a legitimate claim against income. The second thing it does is extend the assistance for the cost of child care to the informal sector. Up until now, we have not been able to really assist with the informal costs of child care; yet we know how many families use informal child care either by choice or by necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing Senator Harradine's question does not recognise is that many of the people accessing our child care are effectively in single-income families or are not in the work force. This figure is not recognised. Our program tries to balance most of all keeping the costs of child care fair and, at the same time, making the provision of child care available to as many people as possible. For example, our occasional child care and the fee relief&mdash;the child-care assistance for that&mdash;is never mentioned by Mrs Carole Carroll, Senator Minchin or anybody opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is paid at exactly the same level. I find it very interesting that Senator Newman does not want to acknowledge that. What we have done is recognise the need for child care and recognise through the tax system assistance for child care and, at the same time, with the payment of the home child-care allowance, recognise the importance of a continuing income to the spouse at home caring for children and the invaluable work that that person does in caring for children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what we have done is recognise those changing roles of women in particular. In their adult lives they will move from the care of children at home, particularly when the children are young, to participation in the work force, and they have a need for child care to assist them in doing that. We have provided programs that support them in their choice. We have used direct payments through child-care assistance and have now assisted that with the tax program for the child-care cash rebate. It is a program that extends child-care assistance to as many families as possible. I believe it is very much based on access and equity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a strange re-run by Senator Harradine of an argument that he put very extensively during the debate on the home child-care allowance and, indeed, the introduction of the child-care cash rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. While acknowledging the overall benefits to Australian industry from the Uruguay resolution, I point out that there are some Australian industries, like the egg and pork industries, that receive no assistance but in the follow-on from the GATT implementation will go to a total free market and be placed in an unfair trade position compared with other countries which will continue to benefit from high assistance levels. For example, the Canadian egg industry will go from a 192 per cent tariff to a 164 per cent tariff, which is equivalent to 80c a dozen over the next six years. As other countries have introduced measures to ease industries through their adjustments to the new GATT requirements, such as an $86 billion package to Japanese farmers and the US proposals, what does the government intend to do for these particular unassisted Australian industries that will be left totally exposed to a continuing unfair international trade situation, including imports from countries which will retain high subsidy levels?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason that Australia has taken such a major initiative through the Cairns Group in seeking to create a climate of fair trade in agriculture is that that is overwhelmingly in the interests of the Australian economy and the Australian rural sector. We have been out in front. The essence of Senator Boswell's question is that we did not, in the Uruguay Round, get as far as we would have wished in getting the elimination of distortions and unfair subsidies in the agricultural industries, and that is correct. We made more progress than has ever been made before. I realise Senator Boswell acknowledged that, and I thank him for that because it is unusual. This is the first time in which the Australian agricultural sector has made big gains out of such negotiations, and this is fundamentally because of the initiatives taken by my predecessors through the Cairns Group, with the support of a large number of other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting examples that Senator Boswell gave&mdash;I did not get a chance to note them all, but I tried to take them down as he spoke&mdash;was the subsidy for the Japanese rice farmers because of the wonderful achievement that we gained in getting access to the Japanese rice market, even though it was less than we should have had. They are having to pay subsidies to compensate for the fact that Australian farmers, for the first time, will get access to this market. The last figures that I saw estimated this market to be worth more than $100 million a year to Australian rice farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to open up the market. We are continuing around the world&mdash;through multilateral, bilateral and, most immediately, regional activities&mdash;to create opportunities for Australian agricultural, manufacturing and service providers to get better market access. But we do not have the budget to compete with the subsidies provided by the major players. If we sought to enter into a subsidy contest, we would lose. It would be against our interest, and it is certainly not consistent with the policy of reducing the budget deficit by slashing outlays, which Senator Boswell's party proposes. We cannot increase spending on everything and reduce outlays at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot enter, and hope to win, the subsidies war. What we can hope to do is get effective constraints upon those subsidies, which we have done through GATT, put pressure to remove non-tariff barriers, put downward pressure on tariffs, which we have gained and continue to campaign for through the Cairns Group, through bilateral approaches, such as those I mentioned earlier with regard to Mexico, and through regional activities, such as APEC, but not only APEC. Those are the strategies we intend to propose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty in answering this question&mdash;and I understand the genuineness with which it is asked&mdash;is that both of the assumptions on which it is based are wrong. I know of no indication whatever that agriculture will not be included in the APEC meeting. I have spent two days talking about APEC with representatives of the 17 other countries. None of them raised it. Maybe somebody else knows more about it than any of us, but it was not raised at the ministerial meeting and has not been. I am not aware of that proposal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our motor vehicle industry is one of the least protected in the region. If we were to get common strategies of very low protection for motor vehicles in this region, it would be of enormous benefit to our industry, which is seeking to export into Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and around the area and which is having difficulty getting into those areas because there are tariffs of somewhere between 100 per cent and 300 per cent. It is still getting some exports because it is an efficient industry, but it is not getting as much as we would like. That is the strategy that will lead to a strong industry&mdash;not trying to continue to build a strong industry on the back of a market of 17 million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, our TCF industry, which is exporting strongly and the exports of which have gone up significantly in recent years, would find exporting much easier if it faced lower tariff barriers in APEC.

We will make decisions based on our judgment of our domestic interest. We will continue with the existing program of liberalisation because we think it is in our interests.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is now over six months since the government accepted the overwhelming recommendations of the Conroy review into the Australian Customs Service. Since then, the government has got on with the job of carrying out those recommendations. I am able to say to the Senate and to those senators interested in this issue&mdash;and there has been plenty of interest in the restructuring of Customs over the last 12 months&mdash;that, for example, we have appointed a new head of Customs and we have established a Customs Advisory Board on which the private sector has the majority of positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week 319 officers will be retiring from Customs under a voluntary redundancy program. A further 67 officers will be retiring early next year and, in accordance with the agreement of cabinet and after discussions with the staff and with the union, there will be new recruitment coming into Customs to provide new blood into the system, but there will be around 250 overall reductions in positions in the Customs Service in line with the reform process. This is a significant saving to the operation of Customs and, of course, a significant saving to the budget of the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have we established a new Customs Advisory Board; we have also established new industry panels, including an industry panel on gateway clearance which also will deal with mandatory electronic clearance. After discussions with industry, if we are able to proceed with these new processes, we will find that this is an area that will provide further substantial savings in the future; but it will only be done after direct consultation with both the staff and with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second industry panel has been established on Customs audit reforms, again looking at ways in which maybe self-assessment in this area can provide substantial savings and more efficiency for the private sector in the area of auditing. We also have a close relationship with the Customs National Consultative Committee. Where appropriate, it has now been agreed that that body will be consulted on the introduction of any legislation for Customs which does not affect budget procedures but which would have an obvious impact on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all in all there have been significant changes in the structure of Customs. I have to say there are now very encouraging signs that with the full support of the staff&mdash;and I want to emphasise with the full support of the staff&mdash;the culture of Customs, which many senators complained about over 12 months ago and earlier this year, is now changing and that change is well under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though we still have a long way to go, I want to pay tribute to the overwhelming majority of Customs staff who have accepted the need for change in the operation and management of their own service. They realise in the long run they will end up with a better service offering a better career structure&mdash;a structure that will offer them a more encouraging lifetime career if they choose to stay within the service. So the changes in the last six months have been significant. We have not completed the changes, but they are well under way.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, yesterday Senator Ellison asked me a question about the imprisonment of Australian businessman Eric Robert Bowra in the United Arab Emirates. I undertook to supply some further information when that came to hand. I now do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I confirmed to the Senate that on 13 November Mr Eric Robert Bowra, an Australian businessman from Western Australia, was sentenced by a UAE court to a prison term of 12 months. This term is to take account of the time Mr Bowra has already served. In addition to the prison term, Mr Bowra was ordered to pay to the family of the deceased the equivalent of about $A55,000 as compensation. This amount has been paid from funds lodged with the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The embassy in Riyadh has now provided me with a translation of the judgment. The judgment, in Arabic, was given to the Australian consul who attended the hearing on 13 November. In the judgment Mr Bowra was found guilty on three counts: manslaughter, causing injury and not aiding the injured. The court, in deciding on the criminal aspects, left it open to the family of the injured party to pursue civil compensation including property damage claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bowra was not present for the hearing. On the other hand, it seems though that the family of the injured party or its legal representative were also not present. Mr Bowra's legal representative from the legal firm of Aljabri and Partners, Abu Dhabi, did not object to the hearing proceeding without Mr Bowra being present. I am informed that both Mr Bowra's legal adviser and an independent legal source considered that this course, though unusual, was not illegal. I believe Mr Bowra's business associates and his legal adviser have decided to appeal the sentence and will do so within the prescribed period of two weeks. It is expected that hearings in regard to the appeal could commence in early December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been questions raised about the matter of Mr Bowra's release, or application for release, on bail. On 5 October a departmental officer in Abu Dhabi, that is one of my officers, was told by Mr Bowra's business associates and legal adviser that they were considering their options regarding the bail order, which had been made on 27 September and was unsuccessfully appealed against by the prosecutor the following day, 28 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An embassy officer was advised on 24 October by Mr Bowra's legal adviser that the lawful reason for the continued detention of Bowra was not known. The next day the embassy official submitted a formal request to the UAE authorities for an explanation regarding Mr Bowra's continued detention. The Australian ambassador in Riyadh followed this up with a high level inquiry on 2 November. A further follow-up was made by the Australian consul to the head of the consular department of the UAE foreign ministry on 12 November, but this was then overtaken by the events of 13 November. Our embassy in Riyadh has, nonetheless, been instructed to seek a written response to its representations, and I will advise Senator Ellison when further information comes to hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important question, and one that I touched on yesterday, is whether an Australian citizen has received, as we would expect, the benefit of the same laws, administration and protection of rights and redress that are available to citizens of the country in which the arrest took place. Mr Bowra's legal adviser has told the Australian consul that a UAE national would have been treated in the same way as Mr Bowra. While his business associates have concerns about the judgment against their colleague, there has been no suggestion that&mdash;apart from the bail question which remains unresolved, and we are awaiting answers on that&mdash;he has been treated otherwise than in accordance with UAE law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, apart from the issue relating to bail, there is evidently no role for the Australian government in the judicial processes of the United Arab Emirates. The next step would seem to be Mr Bowra's appeal, and that is solely a matter for his lawyers. Australian consular officials will, nonetheless, continue to monitor Mr Bowra's wellbeing. I seek leave to have the judgment incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Robert Bowra Case: Court Judgment 13/11/94</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Unofficial Embassy Translation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basis for the sentence in the criminal case no.: 1344/94 legal misdemeanour</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public prosecution presented Eric Robert Bowra after the naval collision accident between the boat of the defendant and the victim's boat. When Jeffrey Howard was questioned, he said that he was with the defendant in the boat and that the cause of the accident was a collision between the two boats and that the defendant was driving his boat quickly, turning and returning and that he knows no explanation for the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the victim's son, Khaled Ibrahim, was questioned, he said that the boat of the defendant came in a fast manner and collided with their boat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Suheil Freih Al-Qabees was questioned, he said that he saw the boat of the defendant going very fast and turning around spectacularly and then heading forward again. When the boat of the victim was coming, the boat of the defendant collided with it strongly from the left side. Due to the strength of the collision, their boat flew up in the air about 10 meters. The report of the criminal laboratory no: 1120/2/14 proved that the iron boat collided with Al-Danah which belongs to the victim at its front left half and went over it by an angle of 45 degree towards the rear right side, colliding with the external edge of the driving cabin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the defendant was questioned, he admitted his error in front of police. But he said to the public prosecution that it was not his fault and that it was the victim's fault. When he was confronted with his attempt to leave the country and his arrest at Abu Dhabi airport, he admitted this and said that he attempted to leave because of fear after the incident had taken place. He explained his inability to treat the victim by saying that there had been other people with him in the boat who were injured as a result of the accident and that he had intended to treat them, and that the incident was near the beach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defendant paid the blood money and 50,000 dirham for the value of the victim's boat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court session of 25 October 1994 was attended by the defendant and the victim's son, as one of the heirs. A representative of the heirs also attended. The son of the victim insisted that the defendant had failed to help them and had left after the accident. The representative of the heirs said that the heirs accuse the defendant of murder because he did not treat the victim after the accident, and this being evidence that the defendant acted deliberately. The representative of the heirs requested that the case be referred to the public prosecution to investigate the defendant and also requested that the second victim be referred to a medical committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding the request of the heirs' representative to refer the case to the public prosecution to investigate the defendant on the crime of murdering the victim, the court rejected this request because it is clear from the papers of the case that the incident took place by mistake. It is clear from the testimony of the witness Suheil Freih Al-Qeesy that the defendant was wandering about the sea and performing spectacular moves. This was before the arrival of the victim and the accused did not change his behaviour. The two sides were surprised to be face to face. If it was deliberate, the boat of the accused would have been following the victim's boat, and there would not have been a collision in the manner which led to the death of the victim. The one who is deliberate takes complete precaution when committing a crime and the collision would not take place in this surprising manner or speed. The report of the criminal laboratory stated that the boat of the defendant flew in the air during the collision at an angle of 45 degrees. This confirms the attempt of the defendant to avoid the incident in all ways which negates intent by the defendant while committing the crime. Therefore, the decision of the public prosecution is right in charging the defendant of manslaughter. Not treating the injured does not constitute a proof of deliberation, and the defendant said that it had been because he was attempted to treated the people injured with him, and that a man in such circumstances feels frightened, and this is shown by the attempt of the defendant to escape from the country after the incident. These two matters, not treating the victim and attempting to escape from the country, are not considered a proof of murder. The intent to murder is something that the perpetrator keeps to himself. The crime of murder requires a special intention to kill the victim. Nobody knows this intention except Allah, unless the tool used in the incident proves it, or unless it is proved by the circumstances of the incident and by the way in which it took place. This crime is a normal collision accident which happened due to the fault of the defendant who did not intend to kill the victim, for the reasons that the court has mentioned. The incident took place by mistake. Therefore the defendant will be punished for the crimes of manslaughter, causing injury and not treating the victims by imprisonment for one year, and be impelled to pay to the victim's heirs the blood money of 150.000 dirham and to hand this sum to the heirs in the court. The heirs will maintain the right to seek the value of damages that occurred to the property of the victim as a result of the incident, and the injured victim will maintain the right to seek compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons the court passes the following sentences:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Convicting Eric Robert Bowra&mdash;Australian&mdash;Christian and 40 years old of the crime of manslaughter of Ibrahim Abdul Rahim Ahmed Al-Sheibani and of injuring the victim Khaled Ibrahim Abdul Rahim, and of not helping them. It punishes him for this by one year's imprisonment and by compelling him to pay to the heirs the legal blood money of 150.000 dirham, which has been received by the court and put in its safe in accordance with receipt no: 84574 and will be handed to the heirs according to normal procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The rights of the injured Khaled Ibrahim Rahman Al-Sheibani and the rights of the heirs of the deceased Ibrahim Abdul Rahim Al-Sheibani  to seek from the defendant civil compensation for injury and for the damage caused to the property of the victim are maintained.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some businesses pay sales tax on the taxable component of their prefabricated product and get their input sales tax free. Other businesses pay sales tax on their inputs and are not required to pay tax on their outputs. Different rates of sales tax are payable depending on the approach adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO has reviewed the industry with a view to ensuring consistency of treatment. As a result, it has issued a draft ruling. The ATO's view is that the law requires sales tax to be payable on the prefabricated buildings unless the manufacturer qualifies for the small business exemption. As is usual with draft rulings, the ATO is consulting with the relevant industry bodies.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Cook's answer to me today, at least in part&mdash;I am not too sure whether it was deliberate or whether it was based just on his basic ignorance of the true facts&mdash;was wrong and, therefore, misleading to the Senate. He claimed that New Zealand interest rates are higher than interest rates in Australia. We were talking in the context of bond rates and long-term interest rates. Let me put it on the record that, according to the latest official statistics, Senator Cook is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term interest rate in New Zealand in August was 8.35 per cent. In Australia it was 9.35 per cent and, indeed, between August and September the Australian rate went up a full percentage point to 10.35 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Michael Baume has corrected the further ignorance that is shown by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The ignorance of Senator Gareth Evans does not surprise me because those opposite all get it wrong. My comments are directed particularly to Senator Cook, but Senator Evans, in his attempt to answer a question of Senator Hill's today, also made some fundamental errors and failed abysmally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get a couple of things on the record about interest rates which were not covered in Senator Cook's answer to my question and which should have been, if he were serious about attempting to answer the question. The fact is that interest rates in Australia are rising and that interest rates in Australia will rise further. The basic reason for both of those two irrefutable facts is that they are due overwhelmingly to the failure of the government's economic policies and, in particular, to its incredible laxity when it comes to budgetary or fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to long-term bond rates in Australia today, which are a fundamental determiner of many other rates and help determine the rate structure in Australia, 10-year bonds are at 10.6 per cent in nominal terms and, in real terms, of the order of 7 1/2 per cent to eight per cent. At that real figure, they are the highest real interest rates that we have had in Australia for more than 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That 10-year bond rate has increased by 65 per cent this year alone. That is a rate of increase that is more than twice the rate in the United States, and it shows no signs of abating. The OECD, the industrialised world's economic think-tank, predicts that next year rates in Australia will be the highest of any industrialised country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government tries to talk about making Australia internationally competitive and getting on with the game. All it is doing, through its policy failure, is to make it increasingly difficult for Australian businesses to do business and for Australian households to maintain a standard of living that ought to be theirs of right in a country such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is so complacent about these facts, I commend to it the article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by its former Finance Minister, Peter Walsh, who points out that the current account deficit is blowing out in Australia; that the government's budget projections are slipping month by month; that interest rates are the highest for years; and that many of the other fundamental economic factors underlying the economy are going from bad to worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook set out to mislead this Senate, and he behaved disgracefully. He found one interest rate, among all the range of interest rates, that was 0.4 of one per cent lower in Australia than it is in New Zealand. Every other interest rate indicator of any substance shows New Zealand interest rates massively below Australian interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an incredible thing for a minister of the Crown to set out to mislead the parliament like this, using the most selective quotation, particularly when all the trends are going massively against Australia, while in New Zealand, of course, the situation, despite a remarkable growth rate double Australia's, shows nothing like the sorts of problems that this government has visited upon Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get the facts so that Senator Evans will be at last informed, because he, being the representative of the government in the Senate, is probably the most incompetent Leader of the Government we have ever had in this place in terms of understanding what is going on in the economy. Let us look at the facts of the call money market. There is no doubt that that is the only market that Senator Cook referred to. That in Australia was 5.5 per cent overnight, when New Zealand was 5.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the 90-day bill market&mdash;7.06 per cent in New Zealand and nine per cent in Australia; the five-year bond market&mdash;8.35 per cent in New Zealand and 10.35 per cent in Australia; and the first mortgage housing rate&mdash;8.8 per cent in New Zealand and 9.5 per cent in Australia. Here we have a farrago of nonsense being presented by Senator Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost as bad as the nonsense we got from Senator Evans himself when he said that there were no fundamentals to justify rising interest rates in Australia. I do not know which fundamentals Senator Evans had in mind, but there is one that strikes me&mdash;and he seems to be talking through it. The fact is very simple indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest fundamental in terms of why Australian interest rates are going up is the balance of payments. Can I let him into a secret, because he obviously does not know it: the September quarter current account deficit of Australia is the worst ever in our history. It is $7 billion. I do not know whether that has ever entered his consciousness, but it means that in Australian interest rates there is built in a premium for the risk involved of foreigners, in particular, buying Australian dollars. That is dramatised in all the recognised expert opinions on what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental fact is that the markets are concerned about the future of the Australian dollar and how it will need interest rate protection to keep people, foreigners in particular, being prepared to hold Australian dollars. Why are we worried about foreigners holding Australian dollars? It is because we have this massive, record, continual collapse in Australia's current account which this government is quite prepared to live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians, I fear, do not recognise what the consequences are every time there is one of these massive balance of payments deficits. It hits their interest rates; it hits the mortgage rates that are so much higher in Australia than in New Zealand. It hits the mortgage rates of ordinary Australians who now are going to the industrial tribunals seeking huge increases in their wages. This is inflationary and, therefore, Australia is being priced out of more markets. As a consequence of this government's incompetent fiscal policy, interest rates have to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, former Senator Walsh knows all about this and he explained to economic oafs like Senator Evans exactly what the facts are. It is a pity that Senator Evans did not listen to Senator Walsh when he had the opportunity to do so in the cabinet because if he had, at least he may have become economically literate instead of trying to pretend, along with his colleague Senator Cook, that the government knows what it is doing. The consequences of its actions are disastrous for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I am an economic oaf, I am in pretty good company because the briefs that I have on this matter reflect the considered opinion of Treasury&mdash;they are a pretty sophisticated bunch of economists over there&mdash;and, of course, reflect the government's total economic strategy, which is the product of many minds other than my own.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. Australian long-term bond yields reflect the market's judgment about a whole series of factors, including likely future real interest rates and inflationary expectations that are built into those; past inflation performance; and developments in other bond markets such as the United States. Some of the recent rise in Australian yields seems certainly to have reflected the recent weakening in the US bond market in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The balance of payments comes into the equation in terms of people's perspectives. But in doing that, it ought to be appreciated that, while the current account situation is certainly not as comfortable as we would like it to be, our debt service ratio, which measures the capacity to handle the current account deficit in terms of the quantum or the proportion of exports, is in very good shape indeed. Part of that is contingent on exchange rate movements, so it jumps around a bit but it is running at the moment at around 11 or 12 per cent. That puts us in very good company internationally compared with other countries which have balance of payments difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, our overall public debt relative to GDP is very low by international standards and that ought to be properly reflected and acknowledged as well. If we are going to have a genuinely sustained low inflationary environment of a kind which the international money markets ought to be prepared to concede, as they are not at the moment, obviously we have to adjust both our fiscal and monetary policy in a way as to ensure that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions that we have taken both in relation to fiscal consolidation and in relation to those interest rates that are within our capacity to control, namely the short-term cash rates and those rates that are contingent upon them, have demonstrated that the government is prepared to take the hard decisions to ensure this outcome. There is absolutely no reason for our credibility to be questioned or threatened in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the interest rate side, the monetary authorities have already reacted decisively and pre-emptively to ensure that low inflation is maintained. That has been widely acknowledged by commentators in the marketplace domestically as an appropriate course to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as fiscal tightening is concerned, it is the case that the 1994-95 budget estimates are that the deficit is expected to be under one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and approaching balance in 1997-98. That fiscal target and our capacity to achieve it compare very favourably indeed with those of the G7 countries, which have announced targets, and indeed compare favourably right now with their performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in response to Senator McMullan's interjection that our budget deficit position is really very good by international standards. Compare the figures at the moment: our 1993 figures reflecting the 1992-93 outcomes indicate 3.6 per cent for us. Compare that with the United States, 3.6 per cent; France, 4.5 per cent; Italy, 9.7 per cent; UK, 7.8 per cent; Canada, six per cent; with only Germany, at 2.2 per cent, being underneath us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the target deficits that we are chasing, Australia's one per cent in 1996-97 compares very favourably with the three per cent that Canada expects and hopes to achieve, the 5.8 per cent that Italy is targeting, the 2.5 per cent in 1997 that France is targeting, the 1.3 per cent in 1997 that Germany is targeting and the 2.3 per cent that the United States is targeting for fiscal year 1997-98. Only the UK, which is chasing zero per cent in 2000&mdash;three years after that&mdash;has a target less than ours. We hope, of course, to achieve that zero per cent, that balance, a year or two earlier than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in terms of comparative performance right now in budget deficit terms we are, exactly as I said in question time, looking very good by comparison with the rest of the world, including the trading countries with whom we normally compare ourselves. That is the environment. The economic fundamentals are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the assault on Senator Cook's integrity is concerned, might I draw Senator Michael Baume's attention to the most up-to-date data I have in front of me at the moment, from the back page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far East Economic Review</EMPHASIS> from 17 November, which compares interest rates around the region. In both Australia and New Zealand the prime lending rate&mdash;I say to Senator Baume that that is pretty significant for business decision making&mdash;is 9.5 per cent. If we look at the interbank rates, we see that one month, three months and six months out we will be a damn sight better than New Zealand for each of those three periods. That is the reality of the matter. There are some other figures&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These figures are in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. On that basis, we would have to say that Senator Cook was not only wrong&mdash;he was comprehensively wrong. I think two fundamental statements were made today in question time, and I think they are worth re-recording. They are: why are Australia's long-term real interest rates, as measured by 10-year bond rates, now at their highest for over 30 years, and why has the OECD recently predicted that Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates of any of its members in 1995?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Senator Gareth Evans to come into this chamber and make certain claims about what he thinks his government is doing, but the bottom line, as measured by real interest rates, is that we are amongst the worst performers in the world. And it is interest rates that have a major effect on living standards, particularly in relation to young home owners, a major effect on employment and a major effect on investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan is in the chamber, and he will no doubt have read this morning the comments made by his former colleague Senator Walsh, a former Finance Minister in this government. He gave a totally different picture from the one that Senator Evans tried to paint for us. The former Senator Walsh&mdash;as I said, a former ALP Finance Minister&mdash;in the article headed `Banana road to republic', pointed out that the current account deficit is blowing out, probably to five per cent of GDP or more. Perhaps this is one of the major reasons why interest rates in this country are so high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans conceded that the balance of payments had some effect. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the real level of interest rates in this country happens to be so high. I again turn to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. I think Senator Evans's staff would be better advised to give him the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> because it would help him to get his figures right on certain key points. In regard to the balance of payments, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> has a table which compares Australia's balance of payments performance with 12 to 15 other industrialised economies. The figures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> show that Australia's balance of payments performance is not only currently the worst amongst OECD countries but is also predicted to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans came into this chamber and said that we had a wonderful conjunction of economic figures. We have the highest real interest rates for 30 years, the highest real interest rates in the OECD area, and the worst balance of payments figures in the OECD area. I put it to Senator Evans, as Senator Walsh undoubtedly pointed out to Senator Evans in his article this morning, that there are some major fundamentals in this country which are going sour. Senator Evans mentioned the budget. These are Senator Walsh's views compared with Senator Evans's:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That permissive target recedes every time (about every second month recently) the structural Budget deficit gets blown out by a "statement" on something or another.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to Senator Evans that there are serious problems in the economy. It ill-behoves Senator Evans and Senator Cook&mdash;who I concede is the junior minister, but who undoubtedly takes his lead from Senator Evans&mdash;to come in here and pretend that everything in the economy is lovely, but find it absolutely impossible to explain why interest rates in Australia are at record levels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In northern New South Wales the Labor member for Page, Mr Harry Woods, was asked about what should happen. He replied, `Well, they can always get money from the Farmhand appeal.' That is an outrageous statement on public policy. The Farmhand money is welcome and has done quite a lot of good, but it is money raised from the public to help people in desperate situations on farms because this government has not come up with an appropriate policy response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to contrast what this federal Labor government has not done with what has been done by the Fahey government in New South Wales. Even though the New South Wales government has greater restrictions than the federal government, it brought in measures amounting to $22 million in August and $60 million more recently. The New South Wales government has given local government relief, matched rural adjustment scheme money, provided relief on electricity accounts, provided funding for humane treatment of stock, provided for plant seeding projects, fodder and water trains, and the carriage of charitable goods, and has allowed grazing on crown land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the federal government response to such excellent measures in New South Wales? The federal government has put out a minor amount of money for social welfare, but in terms of protecting rural Australia's business and farm units so that we have something left to build on after this drought, this government has done nothing and it deserves the condemnation of this parliament and the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument exempts Impulse Airlines Pty Limited from the provisions of Civil Aviation Order 20.11, subsection 9, in relation to the use of emergency lighting, subject to specified conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rule-maker stated in the body of the instrument that it was being made by a delegate of the Civil Aviation Authority. The rule-maker signed the instrument, however, for and on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority. These designations do not appear to be consistent. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on who was the rule-maker in this case and whether the inconsistency has any implications for validity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the instrument does not indicate the day on which it was made, although the instrument is expressed to be effective from 8 September 1994. If, however, the instrument was made and was effective on that date, then unless it was also gazetted on that date it appears to be void under s.48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.  As well, the intention of the instrument, which is reflected in the explanatory statement, is that Impulse Airlines may act contrary to a specified Civil Aviation Order. Regulation 207, however, under which the instrument was made, does not appear to provide a power to exempt anyone from the Civil Aviation Orders or permit anyone to operate contrary to the Orders. The Committee has asked the Minister for advice on these matters.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 of the former instrument and clause 7 of the latter provide for circumstances in which directions may be given relating to the operation of a station and set out the persons who may give such directions. The circumstances are where there might be interference to radiocommunications which may endanger an aircraft or emergencies relating to the environment, risk of death or injury to persons or substantial damage to property. The persons who may give directions are police, Defence Force officers, officers of the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre and certain prescribed officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions appear appropriate and reasonable, but the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to which provisions of the parent Act authorise the conferral of these powers to give directions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Instrument amends retrospectively an earlier Instrument by removing the phrase "of the pancreas", which the Explanatory Notes advise was a typographical error.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that has been brought to my attention regarding the Sizzler chain of restaurants. For the information of the Senate, the Sizzler chain has some 92 restaurant outlets in this country. It is relatively new upon the Australian scene, having been here for only the last couple of years, but it has experienced fantastic growth. It is a United States based concept and it has enjoyed many of the advantages of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been brought to my attention that the Sizzler chain, for the first time known in this particular industry, is importing United States beef. It is, indeed, importing into this country the largest single shipment known of United States beef. It does not show loyalty to its suppliers at all&mdash;that is, the Australian farming sector&mdash;so I think the Australian customers who have patronised this particular outlet should not show the same loyalty in return for this particular act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> today that that beef shipment will be on the restaurant tables around Christmas and New Year. The Sizzler chain is intent on making the difficult situation of Australian farmers, namely, the drought, even more miserable just around Christmas time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians would get amusement out of the fact that this particular chain of restaurants happens to use in its advertising campaigns that well-known Australian Kieren Perkins, the champion Australian swimmer and gold medallist in the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games. That is a laugh. That is misusing a good man, a well-known Australian, when all the time through the backdoor it is screwing Australian suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons given by the spokesmen of Sizzler do not hold up. They are blaming the drought. Talk about walking out on stricken Australian farmers at a time of need! Sizzler has been far too quick to walk out on them. Australians have not walked out on them generally. Even this government at last has come to the aid of the farmers with a package. Australians have extended the hand of charity to the Australian farming sector and generally the nation has pulled together for the plight of the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we cannot force Sizzler to use Australian beef, we would have expected a bit more generosity in this particular aspect because of the plight of the Australian farmers. Its excuses do not hold up. Price is not a factor; it has admitted that itself. One of Sizzler's purchasers, the Sydney based Beak and Johnston, said that price, supply and quality were not an issue. They are all matters&mdash;price, supply and quality&mdash;which Sizzler has agreed are not an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattle Council of Australia says that prices have fallen since last year and premium cattle in Australia still cost less than those in the US. In relation to supply, the proportion of the national kill which was female was rising and was particularly concerning for the production potential of Australia. In other words, Australian farmers are unloading their cattle onto the market, so the cattle yards are actually full at the moment. That may be a different story down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Australian customers of Sizzler should blackball this particular chain of restaurants and certainly should be writing to the chain requesting an answer as to why it is not sticking by the Australian farmers if price, quality and supply are not legitimate reasons. It is going to make Christmas for the Australian farmers rather miserable. If this particular American beef is to land on the tables of Sizzler during Christmas and the New Year, then we should equally in return make Sizzler's Christmas sales miserable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1), (3) and (4) Yes. I am aware of the attack on the Dhahran barracks in which 28 US service personnel died and of the important role which Nurrungar played in monitoring Scud missile launches throughout the Gulf War, which I outlined to the Senate on 5 November 1991 (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 2374).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A US Army investigation of the incident concluded that the Scud missile attack succeeded because two Patriot missile batteries deployed to protect the Dhahran Air Base were unable to engage the Scud. The first was undergoing repairs to a radar receiver at the time, and was therefore out of action, while the other experienced an inexact computer calculation and was unable to detect the incoming missile. The US Army also concluded that, even if there had been earlier warning of the Scud attack, the resulting deaths would still have occurred as the soldiers would have followed their instructions to remain in the building or would have entered after the alert if they were outside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the actions of operators of the system supported by Nurrungar played no part in this unfortunate incident, no disciplinary action was ever contemplated against any Nurrungar personnel.</PARA>

It is understood that another local manufacturer is developing a bullbar for its family sedan which is compatible with its airbag system. It was acknowledged by those present at the Bullbar Workshop sponsored by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority and the NRMA, that all parties involved needed to discuss the issues involved to arrive at a workable solution. That is why the Federal Office of Road Safety and the National Road Transport Commission is coordinating a special working group to examine these issues. It is intended that the bullbar industry be represented on this working group where they can present any test results they might have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Migration (Non-Humanitarian) Program</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no quotas or targets assigned to individual posts or onshore regional offices, but there are stated planning levels at the start of the program year. The progress of the program is closely monitored and if it becomes clear that planning levels are likely to be exceeded, or there will be a considerable shortfall in approvals, close management of places may be undertaken in the Concessional Family and Independent categories through notional allocations to overseas posts. Such allocations are made following close consultations with posts, and are determined solely by such factors as overseas application rates and posts' processing capacities. The allocations are constantly adjusted (often on a week-by-week basis) during the program year as processing trends within posts and regional offices become evident. Management allocations for these two categories do not imply country or regional targets or limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Humanitarian Program</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indicative planning levels are set for each Humanitarian processing post for each component, namely Refugees, Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) and Special Assistance Category (SAC). These initial levels can change significantly throughout the program year in response to factors, including the posts' reassessment of the size of their caseload and emerging situations, which require new or changed responses. There is, however, an upper limit for the SACs which is set by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
