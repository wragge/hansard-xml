<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Civil Aviation Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.319, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 9 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New rr.99AA(5) and (5A) provide that the Civil Aviation Authority may give directions or instructions about the use of airspace; r.99AA(7) provides that contravention of subregulation (5) or (5A) is an offence with a penalty of 50 penalty points. There are similar provisions for instructions in new rr.174A(1), 174D(1), 177(1), 179A(1) and 239 (complemented by r.240) which also lead to offence provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks whether these directions and instructions are subject to gazettal, tabling and disallowance. If they are not, the Committee would be concerned. The Committee believes that it is inappropriate for a statutory authority to make legislation including offence provisions with substantial penalties, which is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations also refer to publication of mandatory offence provisions in AIP and NOTAMS, which the Explanatory Statement advises are Aeronautical Information Publications and Notices to Airmen. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether these publications are subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote to you on 21 October 1993 about aspects of the important reforms which you are implementing in civil aviation legislation. The above concerns appear to come within the matters raised by the Committee at that time and your reply to these present concerns could be expressed in that context.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 13 December 1993 to the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon Bob Collins, concerning recent amendments of the Civil Aviation Regulations contained in Statutory Rules 1993 No 319. I regret the delay in replying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter you ask whether directions and instructions which are issued under new regulations 99AA(5) and (5A) and regulations 174A(1), 174D(1), 177(1), 179A(1) and 239 are subject to gazettal, tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that, as drafted, the new regulations require the Authority's directions and instructions to be published in Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP) or Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS). However, the directions and instructions do not need to be gazetted or tabled in Parliament, and are not subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. Neither are the AIP nor NOTAMS subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with the Committee's views that, as a breach of a direction or instruction may result in the commission of a criminal offence and attract a substantial penalty, the instructions and directions should be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Authority will be taking appropriate action to amend the relevant regulations as soon as possible, to ensure that the directions and instructions are disallowable instruments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put to the Senate a few of the facts of this matter. In the previous parliament the committee took on a reference of its own interest into casinos in Australia and related matters; I will not bother detailing the points of that reference. The committee sought submissions and decided, following an inspection of those submissions, that the reference at that time should not be proceeded with. Parliament was prorogued and during that time one of the submissions that had been made to the committee, and had not been released, appeared in the South Australian parliament. It is important to note that this is a submission to a general reference to the committee and in that sense is like any submission given to any committee that has not yet been released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time and subsequently, committee members were approached by the secretariat of the committee and asked whether the matter should be pursued. As I understand it, not one member thought at the time that it needed to be; that it was a regrettable thing; that it should not have happened&mdash;and it clearly should not have; but that it had not caused any great interruption to the committee's proceedings. This was an inquiry that never really got off the ground and certainly was not an NCA related matter in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, following the release of this document in the state parliament, the South Australian government had an inquiry into matters contained in the submission and, as a consequence of that inquiry, the person who made the submission felt that he was embarrassed because the outcome of the inquiry was in some respects critical of what he had said in his submission. As a consequence of that, he complained and said that the leak of the submission had caused him embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having happened, it seems appropriate to have the matter investigated. While it may not have caused the committee any difficulty or substantially impaired its work, clearly the leak has caused embarrassment to a citizen who was prepared to put some views forward to a committee and he was entitled to rely on that submission being dealt with by that committee other than by being leaked to anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While members individually thought at the time&mdash;and this was March last year&mdash;that it was not something that needed to be proceeded with, because it should not have happened and had not caused any great damage, it is relevant to point out that during that time there was some consternation as to whether the new committee was properly formed. This flowed from the fact that it was entitled to have 10 members and only nine had been appointed. One might argue that the committee did not exist at that time and could not do anything about it because it was not properly formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leaves open, of course, the possibility that any member at that time could have used the appropriate standing orders. No doubt honourable senators and honourable members will be interested in the outcome of this inquiry, if for no other reason than that it should be quite instructive as to the relationship between the privileges of this parliament and the privileges of a state parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects, giving effect to a number of previous announcements, including some measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget. It will also make a number of amendments which have not previously been announced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fringe benefits tax measures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees employed in foreign locations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, a benefit provided by an employer to employees working in certain foreign locations in respect of travel from their work place to obtain suitable medical treatment may be exempt from fringe benefits tax. These foreign locations were to be prescribed by regulation but because of various practical difficulties this requirement is to be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect will be that, subject to certain conditions, the fringe benefits tax exemption will apply in respect of any employee working outside of Australia where there is no suitable medical treatment available at the place where the work is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the period prior to the amendment, transitional provisions will ensure that the exemption will continue to apply as originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact on revenue of this measure is negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Car parking benefits</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, the taxable value of a car parking benefit can be determined by reference to the lowest fee for all-day parking charged by any commercial parking station operator within a one kilometre radius of the car parking facilities provided by an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the wording of the defined terms "all-day parking" and "commercial parking station", employers can use night fees charged by commercial parking station operators and fees charged at kerbside parking meters to value car parking benefits. The use of these fees result in a lower taxable value for car parking benefits which does not reflect the value of the benefit provided. Also, car parking provided by employers in non-CBD areas may be subject to fringe benefits tax where there are kerbside parking meters within one kilometre of the parking facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend these definitions so that the taxable value of a car parking benefit determined under this method can only be determined by reference to day-time rates and kerbside parking meters are excluded from being commercial parking stations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in this bill will prevent an unintended loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-government schools</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 April 1994 fringe benefits tax will be levied on the tax inclusive value of a fringe benefit and any fringe benefits tax payable will become deductible for income tax purposes. This method, known as the `grossing up' method, will ensure that broadly the same amount of tax is paid on fringe benefits as on the wages that would be required, after payment of income tax, to purchase those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax rebate of 48 per cent of the fringe benefits tax payable under the grossing up method is available for certain non-profit, non-government organisations known as rebatable employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain non-profit, non-government schools have inadvertently not been listed as rebatable employers. These are non-government schools established under Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the fringe benefits legislation so that these schools will be listed as rebatable employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact on revenue resulting from this measure will be negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income tax measures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will give effect to the Budget announcement to allow tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings to be used to finance interest falling due on such borrowings during the construction phase of a new road transport, seaport or electricity generating facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to the revenue of allowing interest on infrastructure borrowings to be an eligible spending purpose is $3 million in 1993-94, $10 million in 1994-95 and $30 million in each of the 1995-96 and 1996-97 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second amendment for infrastructure borrowings will extend the scope of such borrowings to infrastructure facilities constructed on any Crown lease of land. At present only facilities constructed on land held under statutory Crown leases are eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax-exempt infrastructure borrowings will be able to be used to finance the construction of road transport, seaport or electricity generating facilities on land held under a Crown lease granted under a commercial contract by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or a tax-exempt authority of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. Both parties must intend the lease to continue for at least 25 years after the facility becomes income producing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will make infrastructure borrowings available where it is appropriate to negotiate Crown leases of the land on which the facility is to be constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will have no effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensions and annuity rebates</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to extend the rebate that applies to superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities paid from a taxed source. The rebate will apply to pensions and annuities that are purchased by rolling over an eligible termination payment arising from the commutation of a deferred annuity or from the commutation of a pension from an untaxed superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will overcome some technical deficiencies in the existing law and ensure that the pension and annuity rebate provisions operate as intended. They will apply to superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities which first commenced to be paid on or after 1 July 1988 and are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leases of luxury cars</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the taxation legislation to ensure that lessors of luxury cars cannot use the "finance method" of returning the lease income to avoid the luxury car depreciation limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the finance method effectively excludes from the lessor's assessable income part of the cost of the car. That part is the difference between the cost of the car and the residual value, which is treated as if it were the principal being repaid by the lease instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the car costs more than the depreciation limit, the share of the excess proportionate to the share of the car's cost which the finance method excludes from income must be added to the lessor's income. This bill will include that share of the excess in the lessor's assessable income evenly over the period of the lease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments were announced on 8 July 1993 and will apply from that date. The annual revenue at risk is $60 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemptions for pensions and allowances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will exempt from income tax bereavement payments made under the Social Security Act 1991 in relation to certain entitlements to pension, allowance and benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide for income tax treatment of basic and supplementary payments in regard to mature age allowance and mature age partner allowance similar to that for age pension and wife pension respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the bereavement payments is such that it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the cost to revenue of the relevant amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue cost of the mature age allowance and mature age partner allowance amendments is estimated to be $5 million in each income year 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payment of instalments by companies and certain trustees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Autumn Sittings this year amendments were made to the income tax law to reintroduce quarterly payments of company tax, which will commence from the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1994-95 year of income. Under the new arrangements, the timing and amount of instalments due depends on the amount of a company's estimated tax for the payment year. More concessional treatment is available for smaller instalment taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In announcing the new arrangements in the Investing in the Nation Statement of 9 February 1993, the Prime Minister stated that special rules would be introduced to prevent companies within large company groups taking advantage of the more generous payment arrangements for smaller companies. Broadly, all companies within a group that has combined estimated tax exceeding $300,000 will be required to pay tax according to the rules for large companies for that year. However, companies with estimated tax of less than $8,000 (i.e. a small company) will not be covered by this requirement.  This bill implements these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grouping provisions will only take effect once the new instalment arrangements are fully implemented, i.e. the 1995-96 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also amend the penalty provision of the new company tax instalment arrangements to ensure that the penalty for an underestimation of a company's tax for the payment year will apply as intended where a second estimate is lodged by the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also make some minor technical amendments to the company tax instalment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will have no effect on the original estimates provided for the new company tax instalment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties for over-franking dividends</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will correct a deficiency in the application of the penalty for deliberate overfranking of dividends under the imputation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imputation system provides for a penalty, franking additional tax, where a company deliberately overfranks a dividend and this event gives rise to a deficit in a franking account of the company at the end of its franking year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will ensure franking additional tax can be applied, as always intended, where an initial payment of company tax reduces the franking deficit tax otherwise payable in respect of the franking account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply to companies that deliberately overfrank a dividend after 14 December 1993, the date of introduction of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will have an insignificant impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Heritage conservation rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also gives effect to the measure announced in the 1993-94 Budget to provide a rebate of twenty cents in the dollar for expenditure on approved heritage conservation works of at least $10,000 on historic buildings and structures listed on Commonwealth, State and Territory statutory heritage registers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme, which will be administered by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, will consist of a two-stage approval process. The first stage will be an application  for a provisional certificate, which will constitute approval to proceed with the proposed work and will specify a limit on the amount of expenditure that will qualify for the rebate. Any expenditure incurred on the work before the provisional certificate is issued will not be rebatable. Except where a taxpayer disposes of the property or dies, the taxpayer will have two years, with a possible extension of three months, in which to complete the work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total amount for which provisional certificates may be issued in a financial year will be limited to $9.5 million. Accordingly, selection for admission to the scheme is expected to be highly competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second stage will be the issue of a final certificate. An application for a final certificate can be made on completion of the work to the approved standard, at a cost of at least $10,000. A final certificate must be applied for before the provisional certificate expires. The issue of the final certificate will result in the taxpayer being entitled to the rebate in the tax assessment for the year of income in which the application for the final certificate was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue cost of the rebate scheme will be limited to $2 million for each financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings banks</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will repeal the current exemption from income tax provided for savings banks conducted exclusively for the benefit of depositors. This exemption is no longer relevant since integration of savings bank activity into trading bank business under the Bank Integration Act 1991. A corresponding exemption from withholding tax for certain non-resident savings banks will also be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are not expected to have any revenue impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exclusion of low income rebate from provisional tax arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently enacted Budget legislation provided for a low income rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for the 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget statement announced that the rebate would be provided on assessment, the intention being that PAYE and provisional taxpayers will benefit from the rebate in a similar manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in this bill supplement the provisions which introduced the rebate by ensuring entitlement to the  rebate will not be available through the provisional tax arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will maintain the original revenue costs for the rebate and avoid a one-off cost increase, in the order of $110 million, to the estimated cost of $530 million for 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation Guarantee amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes several amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to address a number of technical concerns and to clarify certain aspects of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement for quarterly superannuation contributions will be deferred until the 1994-95 year. Consequently, employers could contribute the minimum level of superannuation support prescribed for their employees for the 1993-94 year on or before 28 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1993 Superannuation Guarantee contributions will not be payable on lump sum payments for accrued annual leave, accrued long service leave and accrued sick leave made on termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain statutory authorities will be brought within the scope of the Superannuation Guarantee scheme with effect from 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industrial agreement between an employer in the maritime industry and the Maritime Union of Australia will be recognised as a valid industrial award for Superannuation Guarantee purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make a number of other amendments to facilitate the smooth operation of the Superannuation Guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will have no effect on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be dealing with two insurance bills this morning. We are now dealing with the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993, and later we will be dealing with the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). The first bill, which is the subject of the present debate, was introduced into the Senate on 16 December last year. It was initially listed for debate earlier this session, but its consideration was delayed to enable discussion to be held between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission&mdash;the new regulator&mdash;and industry groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most rewarding aspects of the parliamentary process is the occurrence of discussions between government, industry and the opposition to air the problems associated with bills in an attempt to come to some common ground. This took place, admittedly, only fairly recently and has resulted in a number of worthwhile amendments to the bill. But, not surprisingly, the amendments do not go as far as the industry would hope for in all directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is not expected that any budgetary impact will flow from the first bill, we really cannot ignore the provision relating to the strengthening of cover in professional indemnity contracts which will undoubtedly increase the cost of this cover for brokers and foreign insurance agents. The government assures us that it will be offset by the benefits of increased protection in favour of the insuring public. We have heard this argument before, but increased protection and increased regulation always come at a cost to the industry which is ultimately passed on to the consumer so that, in the end, the consumer pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amending bill amends three acts: the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991. In fact, the Insurance Act&mdash;the first of them&mdash;was amended as recently as 1991, and it is back before us again today. These minor amendments include, firstly, amending the valuation of shares in related body corporates to ensure consistency with the methods used in calculating the solvency of an authorised insurer holding such shares and, secondly, allowing the commissioner to issue directions about the disposal and treatment of certain assets or classes of assets where there is doubt as to the solvency of the insurer. The idea behind this measure is to protect consumers when they deal with insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also amends the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 so that the capital and solvency requirements of registered life companies apply only to the life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment. This is a clarification amendment only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the time the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 was debated, its capital and solvency provisions are a really welcome move. But, as is common practice with this government, it is not until after the event that it realises that the phasing in provisions are necessary and, accordingly, the amendment has something of a retrospective operation. I also mention in relation to the capital solvency provisions that an amendment was necessary to ensure the commencement date for new companies coming to the scheme to operate forthwith rather than on the phasing in basis for existing companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill's major focus is to amend the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act which was enacted in 1984. That act aims to protect consumers against negligence or misconduct by an insurance agent or broker&mdash;the intermediary. It makes insurers responsible for the actions of their agents, and provides a system of registration of insurance brokers and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers. This is to some people somewhat contentious, particularly in the event of fraud. However, the overriding concept of the bill will be to strengthen the sorts of controls that insurance companies exercise over their agents. This is in addition to the powers that are exercised under the regulatory authority of the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC's 1992-93 annual report indicated that in that year there were 1,034 registered insurance brokers, who placed premiums of $3.9 billion. So the legislation affects quite a lot of money transactions. The amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 are based on the review of the operations of the act by the ISC, and do not include matters from the review of life insurance by the ISC and the Trade Practices Commission. Unfortunately, as is often typical of the government, a comprehensive reform of a piece of legislation cannot be done in one attempt. Again it is a dribs and drabs approach&mdash;a bit now and a little bit later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this does give an opportunity to correct some technical problems on the next occasion. I would prefer to have such a comprehensive review that technical difficulties, unintended consequences and the like are picked up much earlier because, as we found yesterday with the training guarantee levy, it took over 3 1/2 years to get a necessary amendment which should have been made at the time in relation to the carry-forward of losses in that particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition is in favour of measures to increase consumer protection, especially when dealing with agents and brokers, we do have some serious concerns about several provisions which are shared by the industry, particularly in the original bill. I will go to some of the offending clauses, particularly clauses 9B(3) and 9B(4). They are the run-off and the non-avoidance clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed subsection 9B(4) provides that acceptable contracts of professional indemnity insurance for foreign insurance agents and registered insurance brokers must contain a run-off clause made within three years. As a result of the recent negotiations, the government decided to amend this three-year period. The bill we now have before us makes for a minor amendment, but it in no way addresses the industry's major concern about the provision, apart from saying it will specify the extent of the run-off period in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are seeing transferred out of the bill a contentious clause relating to a three-year period of run-off. But this contention has been taken from the legislation and placed in the regulations. We have been assured that the run-off period will certainly be less than three years, but I hope that meaningful discussions will take place between the industry and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to get to a satisfactory resolution. Again, this is a provision that should not have been transferred to the regulations but should be in the bill itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have some concerns about the explanatory memorandum in this regard because it is slightly misleading. Not that it is untrue, but the memorandum does say that the amendments, et cetera, were developed in consultation with the industry. While that is true, the final result was not always the result of consultation. The consultations took place, and then the government took a line of action. When it took that line of action I believe that perhaps there should have been further consultation. That was why the opposition asked the government to defer the legislation&mdash;so that these meaningful discussions could take place. But they took place in some haste. We trust that the result will be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed subsection 9B(3) provides that professional indemnity contracts must contain a clause stating that insurers cannot avoid a contract or reduce their liability under the contract by reason of non-disclosure by the agent or broker, even though fraudulent. Insurance fraud is a matter which the insurance industry is addressing by the implementation of full fraud control programs. We welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the provision says that a professional indemnity insurer will have no remedy at all for non-disclosure or misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent. So I ask: has the government considered the impact of this clause on the duty of disclosure which is fundamental to any contract of insurance? Commonsense dictates that the earlier professional negligence claims are reported to insurers, the better the management of a `claims made' scheme. The government amendment will only encourage insureds not to disclose actual or potential claims until they have reached the court proceedings arena. If disclosure was made earlier when the potential claim arose, it is true that insureds' premiums would go up, but by a minuscule amount compared with the amount that an insurer, who must carry the burden of many claims owing to a lack of disclosure, will charge insureds in the future to recover this loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset it should be noted that the professional indemnity market is very small. Interestingly, the only non-avoidance requirement imposed by legislation in Australia in relation to professional indemnity is for solicitors. If the current jump in law cover premiums in New South Wales is an indication of what happens to premiums in a non-avoidable scheme, my message to consumers is: `Beware; ultimately you will bear these costs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Insurance Council of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association, NIBA, have concerns about the inclusion of such provisions in professional indemnity insurance contracts. In fact, the National Insurance Brokers Association argues that together these two provisions, in terms of the original arrangements, would have increased the professional indemnity premiums for brokers by a minimum of 65 per cent. Given that the increases in premium rates over the past 12 months have been between 30 and 100 per cent, a further increase could well threaten the viability of many brokers. Hence the importance of getting this three-year run-off down to an acceptable level. I point out that, had this not been achieved, unemployment queues may well have increased as a result. Those brokers who remain in the industry would be forced to reduce the limits of indemnity they presently purchase. I certainly hope that would not happen. I have been assured by the ISC that indemnity cover is related to the scale of transactions undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Insurance Brokers Association also forecast that, if the proposed subsection becomes part of the law, only two insurers have indicated that they will write professional indemnity insurance business for brokers. This states clearly that the changes, whilst increasing the protection for agents, could well be counterproductive because, given the small size of the professional indemnity market, insurers may face problems in offering run-off cover owing to their reinsurance requirements. This would reduce the operation of free and open competition in a market for professional indemnity insurance also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Insurance Brokers Association pointed out in its submission that presently the NIBA facility requires underwriters to provide terms for all risks proposed, and underwriters have indicated that with the broad scope of cover they would require the opportunity to be more selective in their risks, which could result in brokers not being able to purchase that cover. That indeed would be a difficulty. Underwriters have indicated that they will need to review audit certificates to ensure the solvency of brokers proposing to insure and estimate that 20 per cent of the risks will not find insurance. This process means that the underwriters in a sense become the regulators of the industry, and this I assume and hope is not the intention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Insurance Brokers Association again highlighted that the combination of these two provisions, run-off and non-avoidance, means that an unscrupulous agent may well buy effectively one year's cover and a three-year run-off at a premium which does not reflect the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary for that reason to have a minimum run-off period&mdash;perhaps one year&mdash;which would reduce the cost in the regulations and minimise the potential I am putting to the Senate today. So, if an agent failed to disclose many impending claims and is in charge of a low risk premium, he could dump the accumulated liabilities on an unsuspecting insurer by ceasing business and recommencing with possibly a new business. I think, though, that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission would have something to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause related to cancellation of indemnity contracts seeks to prevent insurers under professional indemnity contracts cancelling a contract unless they give three days notice to the ISC before the date of intended cancellation of a contract. The Insurance Council of Australia queries whether the failure of an agent to give such a notice renders cancellation of the policy void and, therefore, whether insurers are left at risk until notice not only has been given to the commissioner but also forwarded to the insured in accordance with the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Council of Australia also queries whether this provision requires notification where there is cancellation by the insured, its agents or a premium funder. It is hoped that the ISC response would be that this does not affect the cancellation provisions of the Insurance Contracts Act, but I seek that confirmation by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cancellation of professional indemnity contracts by premium funders is in proposed subsection 9B(7). This states that provisions in professional indemnity contracts permitting a premium funder to cancel a loan agreement are ineffectual if the insured is unable or unwilling to comply with the loan terms. Again, the Insurance Council of Australia argues that much of the security of premium funders will be lost if they are unable to cancel loan agreements and receive a refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn now to the commissioner's powers. The ISC certainly has a huge task in overseeing the operation of the insurance legislation, together with the superannuation legislation. It is sincerely hoped that there are sufficient resources, both monetary and human, to undertake this task. The commissioner's new powers with respect to insurance intermediaries in clause 28 aim to overcome the problems experienced investigating alleged breaches of the act, and naturally to increase consumer protection when dealing with intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 41A aims to give the commissioner powers to make decision-making principles in relation to registrations, suspensions and cancellations of registrations and the provision of information by intermediaries. I again merely wish to note that this is a practical step that will assist the review of the commissioner's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 27 deals with the situation where the contract has not been accepted. A broker must, within 37 days, give notice to the insured advising that the risk has not been accepted, and return the money. Whilst the 37-day period obviously alleviates administrative inconvenience for brokers, it is important for a consumer to be advised immediately that the cover is not being placed&mdash;not a month later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 29 and 30 clarify that premiums paid to subagents are taken to have been paid directly to the agent, and that premiums received by an agent must be passed to the insurer within 37 days, unless exempted. The legislation currently requires that the moneys be paid to the insurers as soon as is reasonably practicable. Insurers are bound by their agent's act and the remittance of money is a matter between the agent and the insurer. The amendment does not benefit consumers at all, so why has it been made? Insurers would prefer that no amendment be made or that the time period run from the date of inception of the contract and not as in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I wish to make a few passing comments. The time frame for prosecution of offences under the act has been extended from one to three years owing to the difficulty in tracing offences. It takes some time for breaches to be detected by the commission. I note that initiatives by the insurance industry, such as the establishment of the Insurance Council's inquiries and complaints scheme, undoubtedly play a not insignificant role in monitoring the conduct of the industry, and that is good. I applaud proposed section 33A dealing with the notification in writing by intermediaries to insurers of multiple agency agreements. This clause also has the support of the Insurance Council of Australia. I note that each agent will be responsible for discharging its own obligations under the act and that related agents need not disclose the termination of an agency agreement by a related company. The Insurance Council of Australia believes this is a matter which warrants consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is probably not the last time in 1994 that we will consider amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act.

<PARA>The main function of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993 is to give effect to the findings of an extensive review of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. One of the major initiatives of the bill is to improve the level of protection available to persons dealing with registered insurance intermediaries. This extra protection was to be achieved, inter alia, by requiring intermediaries to have professional indemnity insurance policies which gave cover for a period of up to three years after they retired, sold their business or otherwise ceased trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the tabling of the bills at the end of the last session, it has become apparent that unpredictable market fluctuations in this class of insurance make it desirable to avoid specifying in the act a level of cover which may not always be available to intermediaries on reasonable terms and conditions. The present amendments will remove the reference in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993 to a particular level of cover and replace it with a regulation-making power so that the legislation can be administered on a more practical and flexible footing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal-National Party coalition agrees with the amendment as far as it goes. I wish to ask a number of questions, starting with clause 12, particularly on the professional indemnity contracts. I thank the minister for his response, which actually poses further questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original clause, honourable senators might recall, imposed a requirement for a three-year run-off period, but the amendment that has just been moved by Minister Faulkner removes the three-year time frame and transfers the run-off period from the bill to future regulations. I ask the minister whether I was correct in my interpretation of his explanation that, while this is going to be transferred to the regulations, the government is still looking at a three-year time period, albeit a phased-in time period. I put it to the minister that the three-year time period, whether it be in regulations or in the legislation, even though it might be phased in, is still too long a period, and that raises the question of the non-availability of such a cover and the horrendous cost of such a cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question is: ultimately, will the run-off clause still be three years? I know it is subject to some negotiation, but I want to make sure that there is still not this mind-set of a three-year period. Has the government really considered the extra premium cost to brokers in the run-off requirement? During my speech in the second reading debate, I indicated the sorts of increased costs that were going to apply as a result of the three-year period. Whether it is phased in or not, ultimately there is going to be this cost. So all we are really doing is deferring the problem to a future time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, this could well mean regulation not through the ISC but through the availability of cover and the cost of cover. This will have an impact on intermediaries such as insurance brokers and others dealing with foreign companies. Does the government also concede that, despite the fact that this increase in consumer protection will assist consumers, it will ultimately be a huge cost that will be passed on to consumers? Would the minister like to respond to that first? I have a number of other questions. </PARA>

That alleviates administrative inconvenience for brokers, but I put it to the minister that consumers need to be notified immediately that there is no cover&mdash;not a month later and certainly not 37 days later.

Insurers would prefer that the time period run from the date of the inception of the contract or, alternatively, that the provision not be amended at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. This bill aims to increase substantially the level of protection to the public purchasing insurance products generally and, in particular, those purchasing consumer credit insurance. Consumer credit insurance is taken out by borrowers of consumer credit, such as personal loans&mdash;credit cards, for example&mdash;against a fault in case of loss of income due to death, illness, injury, or unemployment. Therefore, it plays a large role in transactions which may affect most of us at one time or another. It is essentially sold as an add-on to a finance contract and is really offered as a separate item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress for a few moments into the history of review of consumer credit to illustrate just how slowly this government moves. Way back in July 1990 our former colleague from Tasmania, Senator Michael Tate, the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, announced an inquiry by the Trade Practices Commission into the market for  consumer credit insurance. The Trade Practices Commission examined the structure, conduct and performance of the CCI market and produced a report in June 1991. A government working paper was then convened to develop responses to the Trade Practices Commission's recommendation and its report was issued in December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last step in this protracted process was that in July last year the government announced that it would reform the consumer credit insurance system. This bill was introduced in December and its consideration in this session has been delayed to enable further discussion. I thank the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for its briefing on this bill. But the concerns of the industry and the coalition with this bill in its original form were not merely technical ones but issues that went to the very heart of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 should be forthcoming later this year or maybe in 1995, following the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's administration of the act and a broader review of its provisions, which is presently being conducted by the regulatory authority, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the insurance industry has, on its own initiative, met the challenges to increase consumer protection and has not waited for the government to act. The Insurance Council of Australia has established an inquiries and complaints scheme. I remind the Senate that last year this scheme dealt with 23,000 complaints and the cost of the operation has grown significantly, which is indicative of its use by the insured and the fact that they are certainly aware of its existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993, this bill has an expected budgetary impact because under these provisions the ISC will now administer the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. It is estimated that the resources needed will be $130,000 in the current year and $336,000 in each following year. In addition, further resources will be obtained by amendments to the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 which increase the statutory upper limit on the general insurance supervisory levy from $15,000 to $17,000 and on the life insurance levy from $28,000 to $70,000.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum explains that this increase is to recover the cost of administering the Insurance Contracts Act and to cover the increased costs of supervision that will arise from amendments to the Life Insurance Act which are expected to be introduced later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This magnificent jump for life insurance companies is quite astounding&mdash;approximately 400 per cent. One certainly hopes that if the ISC realises its cost for supervision of the Insurance Contracts Act is higher than anticipated, we will not be confronted with amendments to increase the levy again in the near future. I seek the response of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase in the levy will have a serious impact, particularly on the competitiveness of the smaller players in this huge insurance field. This is by no means a good thing for the small companies because often it is the small companies that have the innovative, new products. It is the small companies, I believe, that can often react more quickly to market needs than the larger corporations. Huge levies of this nature, I believe, work very much to the detriment of the smaller companies and to new entrants to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill primarily amends the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. Many of the amendments are small, technical ones, but a number have serious implications for both insurance companies and consumers. I refer first to the new role and powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Previously, the act has been self-administered, which meant the government was unable to intervene easily to ensure the effective operation of the act. The downside of this change is that it can give rise to an increased bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to make dramatic changes in this regard. I recognise that the current commissioner, Mr Pooley, is skilled in this area and I pay tribute to his professionalism and the way in which he has handled this portfolio. I also pay tribute to his officers who have responsibility for administration of the act. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is given extensive powers to require insurers to produce documents and information under proposed sections 11C and 11D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner is also given power for the purpose of undertaking the general administration of the act. The legislation states that the commissioner has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the administration of the act, including reviewing documents issued by insurers given in compliance with proposed section 11C, and reviewing particulars, such as statistics and documents, given in compliance with proposed section 11D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest government amendments to proposed section 11C(1) and 11D(1) qualify the commissioner's powers to require the production of documents relating to insurance cover, particularly relating to the organisational structure and the administrative arrangements of an insurer, and the statistics relating to the nature and volume of the insurer's insurance business. It is stated he can do so `for any purpose connected with the general administration of the act'. This is a significant improvement on what I believe were the previously unlimited powers given to the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Council of Australia recommends that the commissioner also formulate decision-making principles to enable the industry to understand the scope of the ISC's information gathering power. The ICA has concerns about the scope and meaning of certain terminology, particularly in terms of what is the scope and width of such terms as `review'. It argues they may well be extended to imply the ability to probe and also to change things. In particular, the industry body is concerned that the commissioner has power to review organisational structures and even administrative arrangements. The industry body argues this is of no relevance to the administration of the Insurance Contracts Act, desirable though it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The body is also concerned that these provisions may require the production of documents and information that are confidential, commercially sensitive or have legal professional privilege attaching to them. Obviously, the insurance industry is a highly competitive one with many players, big and small, and the divulging of commercially sensitive information to the ISC, with the knowledge that it can in some circumstances pass this on to others, would be of concern to a player, particularly with regard to freedom of information type requests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I query whether such categories of information fall within the `reasonable excuse' category. There is certainly some argument that it should. Alternatively, there should be a class of documents that should be protected under secrecy provisions. If documents are allowed to be distributed by the ISC, that is likely to lead to loss of legal professional privilege. The consequence of distributing commercially sensitive information could be financially disastrous for certain insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that, unlike section 346 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the secrecy provisions here are not protected under section 38 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which would actually permit the ISC to refuse freedom of information requests in respect of documents collected under these provisions. I put it to the parliamentary secretary&mdash;I hope he is listening&mdash;that such protection should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the effect of proposed sections 11C(4) and 11D(5) is that an insurer can refuse to provide information if it would tend to incriminate the insurer. Proposed subsection 11C(3) also exempts the provision of information dealing with insurance cover provided to a particular person unless the person or anyone entitled to a claim under that cover gives a written authorisation to the commissioner. An insurer will not be required to give the commissioner any documents from which the identity of an insured or third party claimant could be deduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst secrecy duties are imposed on the commissioner and his staff by proposed section 11F, the ISC is permitted to distribute the documents in the performance of its duties in connection with the act by distributing the documents to other parts of government or to other persons where, in the minister's opinion, it is in the public interest to do so. I am also concerned about the potential ramifications of such provisions. However, I am pleased that the government's amendment to proposed section 11D(2) only imposes a penalty on an insurer for potentially or recklessly giving particulars or statistics that are false or misleading regarding the organisational structure and volume of business. The original provisions, I believe, were extremely onerous in terms of cost. I look forward to the parliamentary secretary moving the amendments during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, information obtained by the ISC could be used in court proceedings, but the industry body&mdash;that is, the ICA&mdash;asks that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission alert insurers specifically to this fact. Again, I seek confirmation of this point.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Documents which are commercially sensitive, confidential or subject to legal professional privilege should not be available for use by the ISC in representative action under the act, which the act does provide for. We have no objection to the concept of representative action under these circumstances by the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement on the ISC to produce an annual report is objected to by the ICA on the basis that such reports could name particular companies. I believe this requirement is essential to the review of the effectiveness of the ISC as an overseer of the act. But again this is a case where parliamentarians on both sides often differ from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud clause 9, which inserts proposed section 64A. It is essential to consumer protection that purchases on consumer credit be given a cooling off period to ensure that consumers have shopped around and investigated what they are doing. This is central, given that the Trade Practices Commission report found that about 80 per cent of CCI policies are sold at the premises of a credit provider and that the remaining policies are sold by car dealers in conjunction with purchase of a car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of all the discussion in the insurance industry concerning disclosure&mdash;in particular, that of commissions&mdash;proposed section 71A is not as controversial but still attracts some criticism from our parties. The section proposes to impose an obligation to provide pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale information not only to consumer credit insurance contracts but also to any other kind of insurance contract which the regulation designates this section applies to. So we are really giving it a very wide, maybe too wide, brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned that the government may use this as a backdoor approach. The industry body, the ICA, does not believe the industry should be exposed to future regulation bringing in other classes of insurance unless it is clear that there is proper justification. They have a potential to be extremely costly to insurers, and the increased cost would in time be passed on to consumers. Given that at this point the government has not clearly specified the contents of such notices in particular, there is serious concern by and for the insurance industry. I note the Trade Practices Commission report recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . measures be taken to improve the quality, timeliness and relevance of the information on CCI provided to consumers, by ensuring that clear, plain English information is available at the point-of-sale on the nature of the cover, the terms, conditions and exclusions, the "duty of disclosure", the right to choose insurance and an insurer and the right to cancel the policy at any time and that post-sale information is provided to CCI policyholders.</PARA>
<PARA>What is interesting is that this is one of the measures that the commission recommended to improve consumer information on CCI products, and its recommendation was the immediate implementation of such measures. Thankfully, the government's understanding of the word `immediate' is not adopted by the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the timing of this requirement, the provision is to commence on the day fixed by proclamation. Given that the provision may extend to all classes of insurance, some further time may well be necessary, particularly when one takes into account the contents of such notices and that those notices are to be prescribed by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the central problem. I refer to clause 5, which amends section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act, and clause 19, which omits section 87(1E) from the Trade Practices Act. These clauses aim to clarify the position in respect of what legislation will govern insurance contracts. Proposed section 15 provides that an insurance contract cannot be the subject of relief in the form of judicial review of a contract on the grounds it is harsh, oppressive, unconscionable, unjust, unfair or inequitable; or relief for insureds from the consequence of making a misrepresentation&mdash;I emphasise these words&mdash;under any other legislation. I am grateful for the government's latest amendment because it adds the words `but does not include relief in the form of compensatory damages'. I believe this is important and one of the consequences and benefits of the delay in this bill's presentation, which delay enabled this very necessary amendment to get through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission report says&mdash;we wholeheartedly agree&mdash;that consumers need speedy  access to the courts and early resolution of their dispute if they are to avoid the consequence of failure to meet their obligations under credit agreements. The ICA and the coalition are somewhat concerned whether the amendment in its original form or its new format is actually necessary. The industry put to us that the Insurance Contracts Act provides comprehensive consumer protection in relation to insurance contracts through the duty of utmost good faith, the code in part IV in respect of disclosures and misrepresentations, and the general provisions relating to insurance contracts in part V. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry argued that the Insurance Contracts Act should remain the specific mechanism for consumer protection for insurance contracts and that the protection is already afforded for many pre-contractual matters under the Trade Practices Act. Therefore, we ask the government to explain why extension to other acts is necessary when these four or five provisions which are already there seem to be all-embracing. This particular provision creates an element of certainty. The provision not only adds to complexity but can create enormous concern, and maybe even increase costs. The opposition supports the legislation, together with the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, like the bill we have just debated, is also a significant step in the right direction. However, the Australian Democrats believe that some of the consumer protection provisions in this legislation are unnecessarily limited and should be strengthened. This bill is a result of controversy about consumer credit insurance. This class of insurance is designed to take over loan repayments when a consumer is unable to repay loans due to death, sickness or unemployment. No-one disputes that consumers have been badly served by credit insurance. Many have been misled into buying policies as a condition of a loan, and many policies have been ridiculously expensive compared with the actual cover that they provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of the regulation of consumer credit has been recommended by consumer groups and the Trade Practices Commission and endorsed by a government working party. The primary impact of the bill is to give the Insurance and Superannuation Commission power to supervise and enforce the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The act, as it now stands, is self-administering, leaving consumers to take legal action when a contract goes wrong. The costs and complexities involved mean that this remedy is beyond the reach of most Australians. The Democrats therefore welcome the commission's proposed new role, which includes the power to obtain insurance and administrative documents and to take legal action on behalf of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are new provisions regulating the provision of information on consumer credit insurance and any other classes of insurance prescribed by regulation. A 14-day cooling off period will be mandatory. Again, we welcome these developments which are a definite advance on the previous provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I say that the Democrats do have three concerns about this bill. First, the provisions which allow an insurance company to withhold incriminating information appear to unnecessarily tie the hands of the commission. We have been told that such provisions are standard in situations such as this. However, I would like to see evidence and to know why. I am particularly interested to know what powers the commission would exercise where an insurer withholds the incriminating documents. Obviously, the commission would smell a rat; it would know something was going wrong. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) to explain what action the commission could take to follow up on its suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second concern is that an insurer can withhold any document dealing with the insurance cover of a particular person, unless that person has given written authority. For the commission to seek authorisation it obviously needs to know the identity of the person concerned. I would ask the minister how the commission is supposed to discover the names and addresses of people who do not know that there is a problem with their insurance contracts, or do not realise that if there is a problem they can go to the commission for help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a problem with a class of insurance contracts affecting a large number of people, why should the commission not be able to get their names and addresses from the insurer so that they can seek authorisation to obtain the personal documents? There is a question of privacy here, but there is also a question of consumer protection. I suspect that most consumers would prefer the commission to have the power to protect them in such cases, especially in view of the secrecy provisions in this bill which prevent the commission from disclosing any personal information in most circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final concern relates to section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act which limits the legal avenues available for contesting insurance contracts. This bill, and one of the government's amendments to it, will have the effect of removing some of the real or imagined limitations imposed by section 15. That is to be welcomed as far as it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument in favour of section 15 is that the act imposes a duty of utmost good faith on the parties to an insurance contract. That duty is so broad, the argument goes, as to encompass the remedies excluded by section 15 and more. It would be unreasonable to make two parallel sets of remedies available, hence the restrictions imposed by section 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that the duty of utmost good faith is so ill-defined that it may be deterring consumers from seeking legal redress. That is a view that has been put to us by the Australian Consumers Association and has been expressed by the Trade Practices Commission. There has been a minimal amount of litigation based on this utmost good faith test. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission puts this down to the self-administering nature of the act, which will end as a result of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that possibility&mdash;and the commission acknowledges that it is only a possibility&mdash;I fail to see why the act cannot spell out what is meant by `utmost good faith' to make the provision useable. It seems extraordinary that the duty of parties to an insurance contract, which is a contentious and complicated matter, is encompassed by such a vague and general phrase. I would ask the  parliamentary secretary, who is at the table, to respond to these three concerns, either now or perhaps during the committee stage of this bill. In recognition that this bill is a step forward and in the right direction the Australian Democrats will support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of clauses on which I seek some clarification, and I thank the parliamentary secretary for his previous comments. Clause 4 gives the ISC extensive powers to require insurers to produce documents under proposed sections 11C and 11D. The only basis on which insurers may actually resist the production of such documents is if there is a reasonable excuse, or if the production of the document would tend to incriminate the insurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 11F deals with secrecy, but permits the ISC to distribute documents in the performance of its duties in connection with the act, for example by publishing material in its annual report, by distributing the documents to other parts of government and by distributing the documents to other persons where, in the minister's opinion, it is in the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that the documents requested by the ISC could include documents that are commercially sensitive, confidential, or that have legal professional privilege attached to them. There is a case that such documents actually should be protected by these secrecy provisions. The reason for this, I believe, is that if documents are allowed to be distributed beyond the ISC, then it is likely to lead not only to a loss of legal professional privilege but may also lead to a loss of secrecy attached to commercially sensitive or confidential documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly these documents should not be available to be used by the ISC in representative actions under the act. I put this case to Senator Sherry because, unlike the provisions in the section 346 of the Superannuation Act, the secrecy provisions here are not protected under section 38 of the Freedom of Information Act which would, in that case, permit the ISC to refuse freedom of information requests in respect of documents collected under these provisions. I find it strange that there is this difference between life assurance and general insurance. This is an issue that does need some explanation by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also seek a confirmation from the ISC through the parliamentary secretary that it will not permit the distribution of documents pursuant to its powers under the secrecy provisions where the documents are commercially sensitive, confidential, or to which legal professional privilege is attached, where they could be used in representative action taken by the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also seek confirmation that it is a reasonable excuse for an insurer to refuse to hand over documents on the basis that they are subject to legal professional privilege, that the information sought is commercially sensitive, and/or that it is confidential, without undertakings being given by the minister and the ISC that in no circumstances will documents be passed on or used in litigation against the insurer that is actually providing them. </PARA>

The ISC will then naturally take a much greater degree of interest in that particular case. It would be unreasonable to force a company to disclose documents that may incriminate it. However, it certainly would alert the ISC and make it more interested, aware and keener to go further into the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask another question relating to 11C(3), which again deals with documents. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, there will be occasions when the commission should be able to discover the names and addresses of people who do not know that there is a problem with their insurance contracts or do not realise that they can go to the commission for help.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Lees is suggesting in this case is that the ISC should take a particularly activist role in going out and seeking names and following those names through, presumably going to see these people. I am advised that there are a couple of problems with that approach. Firstly, to what extent can it become activist? There are limitations on staffing and resources to do that sort of highly activist work. Secondly, it would raise some privacy aspects. If a consumer has a particular concern, does he necessarily want the ISC to come in, having obtained his name, and take an early activist role? The consumer may not want that. It is a matter of balancing how far the ISC should go in being activist in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine that there would be concerns expressed by some consumers if the ISC suddenly turned up, having got the name and address, and said, `We believe you may have a problem; we are here to help'. I think a lot of consumers would view that as being helpful, but some would think, `How did they get my name? Why are they turning up when I haven't asked them? I might want their help a little later on, but I don't necessarily want an officer from a government agency turning up on my doorstep, having obtained a name and address when I thought it was confidential'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that there is no specific budget set aside to run a major advertising campaign alerting the public to these changes. Naturally, with changes of this nature, which I think generally improve the rights of consumers, the ISC is contacting all the main consumer groups and, obviously, the companies themselves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The three bills the Senate is now debating, Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), comprise the traditional additional estimates bills for 1993-94. In these particular bills, the parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1993-94 under the appropriation budget bills which became acts Nos 1 and 2, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These additional appropriations in the three bills before us total $710 million. After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase, in total, of $164.5 million in the appropriations for 1993-94, which is an increase of half a per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not, of course, oppose the appropriation bills. However, there are some unusual items in them that are worth drawing attention to. For example, in Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which seeks an additional appropriation of about $166 million for a variety of items, there is included a figure of $25.2 million for compensation for defendants and others in the Midford Paramount case. I remind the Senate that that was the case instrumental in the criticisms levelled in a damning report by an independent committee of inquiry into the functioning of the Australian Customs Service which has resulted in major changes being proposed for the service and the removal of Mr Kelly, the head of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these items there are various appropriations about which on occasions there has been, and may continue to be, considerable debate. Overall, I repeat that the coalition will not be opposing the bills. In this debate I wish to look at the budget outlook for the government as it moves towards the 1994-95 budget which, of course, is to be introduced on 10 May. This is a fundamental break with tradition because in the past we have always had budgets introduced in August. This time as a first the budget will be introduced for the forthcoming year before the end of the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the deals being constantly done in this place by the government with the minor parties, we have the absolute charade at the moment of the Treasurer's tax club, comprising the government and the minor parties, purporting to hold negotiations over the budget, even though the minor parties do not have any power at all to change the government's budget proposals. They, in total, including the independents, have just 10 votes in the Senate; the coalition has 36. The Democrats and the Greens will not be able to change any of the government's proposals without the opposition's support. Before I conclude, I will indicate what the coalition will and will not support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that the purported negotiations going on between the government and the minor parties is nothing more than a charade. To the credit of several members of the minor parties, they have already woken up to that. But, as part of that negotiation, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) released earlier this week what he called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1994-95 Fiscal Framework</EMPHASIS> which is a document which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . presents the economic and fiscal framework for the 1994-95 Budget and is the basis for consultations with the Democrats, Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine as set out in the agreement reached between those parties and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore assume that we can take the document as setting out the government's initial thinking as to where it is going to finish up in terms of the 1993-94 budget outturn and where it sees the main issues for the framing of the 1994-95 budget. The document is very disappointing. It has given no new information at all but just reiterated the government's strategy. As I said, the minor parties have seen through the charade and know that this is not, in any sense, a genuine platform for negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me most about the document in terms of substance is that there is an underlying impression that one gets of major complacency on the part of the government about prospects for the budget for the year ahead, although the Treasurer, being the author of the document, says the fiscal framework for next year will be very tight. I will elaborate on that in a moment. Having read the document, there is a feeling that the government is smugly looking at the economic recovery, which is, undoubtedly, commencing to occur, and saying almost, `She'll be right, Jack. Things will grow in a normal cyclical way and most of our problems will be solved in that sense as a result of that. There isn't a whole lot more that we have to do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be further from the truth. The fundamental problems which beset the Australian economy are very little different from what they were when the now Prime Minister and then Treasurer, Mr Keating, pulled the levers and engineered `the recession that we had to have' back in 1990. Over the last four years Australia has gone through a great deal of trauma and hardship, not just for the Australian economy as a whole but, much more tragically, for most Australians&mdash;in particular those millions of Australians who are unemployed, still, and the further million or so who cannot find full-time work or work of a nature that they would wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone through all of that hardship without having made the necessary structural changes that will enable the Australian economy to grow on a sustainable basis in the future in a way which will enable significant long-term job creation, a reduction in unemployment, and the overcoming of the Achilles heel of the Australian economy, namely, our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not get those structural changes right, we will continue to be on the boom-bust cycle witnessed so much in the past. There is no indication in the Treasurer's fiscal framework document for 1994-95 to suggest that the government has, in any way, learnt the lessons of the past. I will point to some examples to demonstrate my concern. In the document the government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge involved in framing the 1994-95 Budget is therefore to adequately address priority areas such as unemployment, Native Title legislation, industry and regional development while maintaining a fiscal policy which will promote a durable extension of the recovery now clearly under way. Sustained high levels of economic growth require the maintenance of low inflation, low interest rates and the avoidance of a balance of payments constraint. A fiscal policy which reduces the level of public sector demands on the economy as private sector growth accelerates, and reduces the public sector's call on the national savings needed to fund economic growth, is essential to achieve these outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very negative approach to the requirements of fiscal policy here in Australia. The Treasurer is saying that the government needs to reduce its budget deficit to help the national savings cause. That is technically correct, but where it is so negative is that it poses no prospect or expectation of that happening. It makes no attempt not just to reduce the public sector deficit but to eliminate it so that the government can stop doing what it has been doing right through this government's period of office, which is&mdash;to use a Paul Keating term of a few years ago&mdash;`putting its hand into the cookie jar of the nation's savings'. This government has been doing that year after year by clocking up more and more deficits of varying degrees of magnitude. Most of them, compared with the standards of the past, were record deficits&mdash;by many billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not simply a matter of the government reducing its budget deficit. It ought to be saying that it will eliminate its budget deficit and make a positive contribution to savings, not just reduce the negative contribution that it is already making. In its paper, the government goes on to talk about the economic recovery. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recovery has strengthened noticeably over the past six months.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, but it does not acknowledge the fact that this economy was absolutely shattered by government policies which led to the very stark, brutal recession that we have had over the last four years. So the recovery is starting from a very low base indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also omits to say that the recovery that we are witnessing in the economy is a much more muted recovery, a much smaller recovery in proportionate terms, than we saw in the corresponding period of recovery after the last recession in the early 1980s. The government then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are early signs that business investment is beginning to respond to such favourable fundamentals as high levels of corporate profitability and reduced balance sheets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that response, however, is still being constrained by excess capacity which, although beginning to fall, remains relatively high.</PARA>
<PARA>So far as investment is concerned&mdash;and investment is a key plank, perhaps the essential plank in sustainable economic growth prospects for the future&mdash;it is certainly modest, to say the least. Yet the government, in its predictions for the year ahead, says that it is expecting a significant pick up in business investment next year&mdash;it uses the word `substantial'&mdash;and that is implicit in the projections of economic growth in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the investment climate, the situation overseas, the turmoil that we have witnessed on financial markets over the last few days and the start of the reversal of the appreciation of the Australian dollar that was occurring&mdash;in recent days we have seen the Australian dollar fall a couple of cents against the US dollar, which is a fall of three to four percentage points&mdash;the scope for complacency about the climate in which potential investment will occur is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying it expects underlying growth in the economy next year to be around four per cent. I think that is certainly questionable on the basis of the evidence to date, but even if it were correct, one must say, `So what?'. That is no big deal. Indeed, it is a very poor result if that is the best we can do coming out of a recession of the depth that we have had in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that it is not all that long ago that the Prime Minister really put his job on the line when he said, `If you can't get four per cent growth in any year you should give the game away'. The government is saying in this document that even in what it sees as a strong recovery year it is not going to do better than four per cent. I think that is a considerable concern. The government's complacency about the balance of payments is breathtaking. In this document the Treasurer says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current account deficit (CAD) in the first half of 1993-94 was also better than expected, leading to a revised forecast for the year of $17 billion or 4 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Big deal to that! He is saying that because of some recovery in the economy, the huge deficit of $18 billion&mdash;$18,000 million&mdash;that the government forecast that we would have in our dealings with the rest of the world in this current year, will be reduced by a whole $1 billion. That is just not good enough. It is an appalling result and it compares very unfavourably with the two preceding years. In 1991-92 we had a large enough balance of payments deficit. It was $12.4 billion. In 1992-93, it jumped to $15.4 billion, which was 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Treasurer is beaming about an improvement in the balance of payments position because the budget forecast for the balance of payments this year is not going to be quite as bad as the horrendous figure that the government was proposing at that time. One could go on and on through this document and express the same concerns that I am outlining and giving some examples of here. Time does not permit me to go further into that. No doubt they will be matters for debate on later occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is clear beyond any doubt that the government is far too complacent about its approach to the budget for 1994-95. It is saying implicitly that there will be a budget deficit in 1994-95 of between $12 billion and $13 billion, which would be a bit of a fall on the likely outcome for this year of $14 3/4 billion&mdash;but it is nowhere near good enough. If it is to have any hope of achieving the deficit reduction to one per cent or thereabouts of GDP that it has claimed it is aiming for in 1996-97&mdash;this is the strategy that it went to the last election with, and we all know it lied its way into government at that election through making a whole string of promises that it knew it could not keep, and most of which it has broken since the last election; and the deficit reduction strategy will be, I am sure, another one of them&mdash;then it has to make a much better start on reducing that deficit than it appears to be doing in the coming budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has put out a budget declaration. It was announced by the shadow Treasurer, Mr Downer, a couple of days ago. It comprises four basic planks: firstly, that there should be no tax increases; secondly, that no new taxes should be introduced; thirdly, that the budget deficit in 1994-95 should be below the $12 billion or $13 billion planned by Mr Willis; and, fourthly, that there should be no overall increase in government spending. They are the four planks of basic budget policy that we are going to hold the government accountable to in the forthcoming budget. I think it will have a major task on its hands; it is going to have to do much better than it is intimating at the moment it will be able to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the appropriation bills Nos 2, 3 and 4 of 1994. Before I get into the bills themselves and the lack of funding for certain things in Australia, I wish to mention the COAG meeting that was recently held in Hobart, where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hijacked the debate by claiming that only the states must complete micro-economic reform. This is happening at the same time as he is attempting to centralise power more and more in Canberra and asking the states to carry out his micro-economic reform so that he and Canberra can take the credit for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years this has been aided and abetted by certain state premiers, such as the former Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, the endorsed candidate for the seat of Fremantle. In the unlikely event that she wins on Saturday week, I will outline to honourable senators a comparison of what she has and has not done for Western Australia. It will be remembered that Carmen Lawrence sat through all those cabinet meetings of the Burke and Dowding years and, when it came to the Western Australia royal commission suffered a sudden loss of memory&mdash;nothing could be remembered! Yet a former Liberal Premier of Western Australia with his ministers&mdash;and I can remember Mr Jones coming into the royal commission&mdash;got out of parliament 10 years before Dr Lawrence and they could remember everything. It is marvellous how the younger generation in Australia has a lack of memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence was No. 1 to sell out state rights and individual rights in Western Australia&mdash;she gave them away. It is important that states, especially those as far away as Western Australia, do not give up state and individual rights. Yet that is exactly what she did. For example, when Dr Lawrence attended the first COAG meeting in Brisbane, she signed a blank cheque, with no conditions whatsoever, to sell out Western Australia's standard gauge line that runs from Kalgoorlie through to Fremantle. This is the only standard gauge line on the Australian standard grid that was making a profit, but she was ready to sell it out for nothing. That line makes a profit for Western Australia of $2 million a year. When the Court government came along, Richard Court and his able Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, soon put a stop to it and refused to go into the National Rail Corporation because of the sell-out that would have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the case of Mabo, where various premiers in Australia sold out or took a soft line to Mr Keating. But not Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia&mdash;and it was just as well that he stood up to Mr Keating because not many others did. Judging by what Carmen Lawrence said during the Mabo debate, I believe that if unfortunately she had still been premier of that state, she too would have sold out. Of course, as we know, Mr Court acted to stop the federal government taking over land management in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on to money matters. I refer to an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which notes that, if the forthcoming Premiers Conference takes up the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommendations, there will be massive funding cuts to Queensland and Western Australia. The commission has recommended that grants to Queensland should be reduced $148.7 million to $3.2 billion, and in the case of Western Australia funding should drop $53.5 million to $1.8 billion. As usual, the big winners are the more populous states of Victoria and New South Wales. In Victoria, the Liberal government has not been in power long enough to turn the economy of that state around, but it is doing quite a job. The same comment applies to South Australia. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commission chairman, Mr Dick Rye, said yesterday the changes to State funding proposed in the report reflected changes in State economies and the use of more up-to-date census information.</PARA>
<PARA>I leave aside for the moment the census information, but the improved economy of Western Australia, as a result of the efforts of the incoming Court government, is reflected in the fact that that state will receive a cut in Commonwealth grants. The economy is obviously looking up in Queensland, with improvements in agriculture and the mining industry. It is peculiar that even though states act to improve their own economies, their Commonwealth grants are cut off by Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Grants Commission has made a few other strange findings. One of the reasons for changing the allocation of grants to Queensland and Western Australia was that those states also reported a reduction in the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in their populations while New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania had large increases. I find that hard to believe. I would like to see more definite statistics than those proffered in that article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Goss is reported as saying that the whole system was `seriously flawed', and I agree.

<PARA>When Senator Collins was minister for transport, much was made about road funding allocated to roads but not being spent on roads. I was always a critic of untying road funding but this government went ahead and did it. Senator Collins criticised some municipalities in New South Wales, yet the same went on in the state of Western Australia. I asked him a question about $8 million that was taken off road funding in Western Australia. A letter dated 2 June 1992 from Mr John Dawkins, Treasurer of Australia at the time, to the Premier of Western Australia at that time, Dr Carmen Lawrence, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Premier</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's "One Nation" Economic Statement made available to Western Australia up to $47.7 million under the National Highway System (NHS) Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these monies, some $39.7 million is to be allocated to specific NHS projects. I understand that agreement between the respective Commonwealth and State Ministers as to these projects is imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining $8 million has been held over, pending further consideration of infrastructure projects of benefit to the Western Australian community. While notionally allocated to the NHS program, it was anticipated in the formulation of the "One Nation" package that this further consideration would encompass other than potential NHS projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When making this decision we had in mind the fact that the Hatt Report on the redevelopment of Subiaco Oval was in its final stages of preparation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the WA Government decide to proceed with the redevelopment project, the Commonwealth would be prepared, under certain conditions, to have this remaining $8 million allocated for this purpose in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA>The then Premier of Western Australia, in probably the only good act she did for us, wrote back to Mr Dawkins and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 2 June 1992 proposing that $8 million of road funding made available for Western Australian under the `One Nation' statement be reallocated to the Subiaco Oval redevelopment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot agree to this proposal, as Western Australia has very substantial needs for road funding which are not being met from existing resources.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to explain that they could not do it. Yet when I asked Senator Collins in the Senate why that $8 million was removed from road funding for Western Australia and allocated to Subiaco Oval, he completely denied that it was ever for road funding. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I remind the minister that last week he said that he had no time for states that did not spend untied road funding on roads. What part did the minister take when the Treasurer instructed the then Premier of WA . . . to set aside $8 million of the One Nation road package for WA for non-road projects and be spent on redeveloping Subiaco Oval?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Western Australian government knows full well, the amount of money that was set aside for Subiaco Oval has not compromised the funding for the road program in Western Australia at all.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked the following supplementary question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is the case, when will the minister restore the $8 million to WA's road funding?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as I just explained to the Senate, it did not come out of there&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning road funding. I think that Senator Collins has a big explanation to make as to why he misled the Senate that day. I believe this is part of a wider concept belonging to the sports rort situation, where $8 million was taken out of road funding, allocated to the Subiaco Oval and yet denied by the previous minister. There must be more to it than this, because there are a lot of unanswered questions. I would like an explanation sooner or later, and those opposite can be assured I will be following it up. </PARA>

A few weeks ago the ABC turned off those VLX transmitters in the 31-metre band and left those remote areas high and dry as far as regional ABC is concerned. Mr Murrell, acting manager of the ABC regional station, explained that it will save $2 million in infrastructure costs and $800,000 in annual maintenance costs. He said that people could put in an earth receiving dish and get the same program. They will not get the same program, for a start. The earth receiving dishes cost about $3,000, with another $2,000 to receive radio, and they do not give the right program. </PARA>

The previous speaker, Senator Panizza, who was heard in silence, opened his comments by referring to the Fremantle by-election and, in particular, one of the candidates in that by-election, Carmen Lawrence, a former Premier of Western Australia and a former leader of the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. I am not going to seek to canvass the issues in the Fremantle by-election; that will be done in Fremantle.

An individual member, obviously with the endorsement of his leader, got up and attacked a political candidate and virtually accused that candidate of murder. We also heard in this chamber&mdash;I only heard it afterwards&mdash;accusations about blood on the hands. Mr Keating, in defending attacks on him the other day, said, `You started it first'. In the past I have refused to use this place as a coward's castle, but I give fair warning that, if this type of behaviour continues to be condoned by Dr Hewson and by the leaders of the Liberal Party and the National Party in this place, I too will use those cowardly tactics to attack individuals who sometimes do not have the right to defend themselves. </PARA>

I do not want to engage in cowardly attacks on any other individual but, if these actions continue, obviously with the endorsement of the leadership of the Liberal Party and possibly with the connivance of the National Party, two can play at that game.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in this debate on the appropriation bills, I want to make a few points about government waste. I do not think there is any doubt that the Australian Labor Party has never been able to handle money; that is well known. If we ever needed an example of that, we have had it recently with the sports rorts affair, where there was a laissez-faire attitude to handing out money without any accountability. If we look back over history, there have been plenty of former Labor governments around Australia where there was evidence of wastage and mismanagement of money. We have a budget deficit projected at something like $14.75 billion, an overseas debt of $180 billion, and a Prime Minister heading this wasteful government whose buying of teak tables, Gould prints and the like certainly does not set a very good example, not just to ministers but throughout the whole of the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mismanagement and wastage of money is continually being exposed by the Auditor-General. Only this morning the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Mr George Gear, raised a matter that seemed to get under his skin&mdash;the fact that the tax office had spent some $60,000 on artworks in Melbourne when it could have leased the artworks from Artbank, which was set up by the government. As chairman of the coalition's Waste Watch Committee, I am criticised by government members for asking what seem to be useless questions. Sometimes we have to go up a few dry gullies to get a few answers. With the way the estimates committee system is operating at the moment, it is very difficult to get the answers we want, so we have to put a lot of questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 20 minutes available to me today I would like to raise publicly some of the matters that have come to my attention, and people can make what they want of them. They are fairly good examples right across the board of the waste and mismanagement that has been going on in the 10 years of this Labor government. Only yesterday, during the training guarantee levy debate, there were comments from the Democrats and our side of politics about the perceived waste of the conferences that are being forced on government departments by the training guarantee levy. I have a long list of things here, and I will put out a proper summation of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it might be of interest to honourable senators to hear examples of the ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money in conferences and so-called training, and the exotic resorts that people are going to. There have been three conferences at the Beachcomber Resort at Toukley in New South Wales for which participants have paid, on average, $411 per person, $820 per person and $424 per person. One conference at the Burnham Beeches Country House in Victoria, a well-known, very up-market place, cost $24,447 for 42 people, which worked out at $582 per person. The Hyatt Hotel at Coolum in Queensland was not a bad little effort, either. Nine people went to a conference there at a cost of $11,400, or, on average, $1,266 per person. The notorious Thredbo Alpine Hotel has hosted various conferences, averaging between $980 and $1056 per person, and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a foolscap page list of some of the resorts that have been used for these so-called conferences. They include the Nautilus resort at Coffs Harbour, the Beachcomber Resort at Toukley, the Aanuka Beach Resort at Coffs Harbour, the Byron Bay Beach Resort, the Sheraton Breakwater in Townsville, Magnetic Island, Kakadu, the Burnham Beeches Country House, the Hyatt Hotel Coolum, the Rottnest Lodge in Western Australia, the East Coaster Resort and the Diamond Island Resort in Tasmania. There are hundreds of these places being used for these so-called conferences. The amounts of money are staggering, and it is all taxpayers' money. It is all being used because of the training guarantee levy that was debated here yesterday. That debate highlighted the fact that even government members are aware of the criticisms. Bill Kelty has criticised this absolute waste of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the practices going on in government departments seem to be quite ridiculous. For instance, only this week I found out that in Hobart the Commonwealth Employment Service decided to advertise 12 trainee employment officer positions. One would think that that would be a pretty simple process. There were 850 applications. The people deciding on the applicants drew up a short list of 209 and decided to swan around Tasmania interviewing the applicants. It cost something like $90,000. If this had been done in private enterprise, it would have cost about $20,000. That might be only a $70,000 saving, but it is an example of the waste that is going on right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the veterans' affairs department in Queensland decided that it had better do something about amenities for its staff. Let us face it, the staff have a lunch hour and perhaps a tea break in the morning and one in the afternoon. The department said, `We will buy them a $7,000 billiard table; it is taxpayers' money. What else can we do? We will buy $48,500 worth of executive furniture as well'. The social security department thought it should have a corporate wardrobe, so it spent the best part of half a million dollars on a corporate wardrobe. It spent $99,000 in devising the uniforms; another $150,000 in freighting them out and promotion costs; and a further $78,000 in 1991-92, $42,000 in 1993, and $42,000 in 1994 just to show the collection.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The additional expenditures in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) and associated bills, after allowing for savings, amount to about $164 million. The opposition is not opposing these bills, as they are alterations to the original budget legislation. However, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that we in Australia have a very serious long-term economic crisis in front of us. There is far too much complacency by the government about the state of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the fact that economic growth is running significantly higher than the government forecast in its budget papers last year&mdash;it is currently running at about 3 1/2 per cent of GDP growth as opposed to the 2.75 per cent that was forecast&mdash;there is a major deficiency. There is a real investment strike in this country. The level of investment is at its lowest for 40 years and, for a subset of that&mdash;plant and equipment&mdash;at it lowest level, as a proportion of GDP, for 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current recovery in the economy cannot be sustained unless there is a very substantial increase in investment in Australia. We need an investment boom and we are not yet seeing signs of getting it. The government has to change its attitude in order to encourage an investment boom. The Commonwealth budget for the 1993-94 financial year was really irresponsible in economic and fiscal terms. The Commonwealth has deliberately gone about increasing its borrowings, purely for consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When everyone else around the country, state governments and businesses, were cutting costs in order to be internationally competitive, the Commonwealth government was increasing costs and taxes, and going for a very substantial increase in the deficit. Estimates are that Commonwealth borrowings&mdash;for the general government only&mdash;will rise from $50 billion at 30 June last year to $69 billion by 30 June this year. We did not need that pump priming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the economy is growing faster than the government originally forecast goes to prove that there was no need for the pump priming. We as a community are saddled with the additional debt. The government has to reduce the deficit&mdash;and very quickly&mdash;and encourage savings. It is only through that route, with the Commonwealth government showing the lead, that there will be any chance of investment being encouraged and taking off. So the government has to show a reduced deficit and increased savings. It has to do that by cutting costs, not by increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, investment in Australia is at its lowest level for 40 years. The latest national accounts figures show that private sector investment has grown by a very modest 0.9 per cent in 1992-93. The difficulty for Australia is that, in order to get the investment needed for sustaining jobs in the longer term future, we need an increased investment of two per cent of GDP. That represents an additional $8 billion or $9 billion per year. We cannot do that unless the Commonwealth reduces its deficit and there is less pressure on interest rates. The private sector will then know that this government is serious about turning the economy around in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, the opposition supports the government's objective of reducing the deficit in the long term; our concern is the speed with which that reduction is achieved. Because the economy is currently running at a much faster rate than anticipated by the government, there is a golden opportunity to do something about it&mdash;to reduce the deficit more quickly and for the government to aim for a surplus as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has signalled through the media and through the paper it recently released that it is aiming for a deficit reduction of three per cent of GDP, which is the equivalent of about $12 billion or $13 billion. We believe that we should be aiming for a deficit closer to two per cent of GDP next financial year, with the difference made up by cutting costs, not by increasing taxes. That will send two major signals to investors internationally and here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it will significantly reduce the pressure on interest rates. Interest rates have been going up internationally, led by moves in the USA. There is pressure internationally for interest rates to go up again and long-term interest rates in this country have tended to edge up a bit also. To stop that process escalating, a reduction in the deficit, which will mean the community making additional savings, will send the right signals to the financial markets and keep interest rates low. That in turn will encourage investment in the economy, create jobs, and lead to future economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key direction is the cutting of costs. The Commonwealth government has done very little to cut its cost structure. The state governments have put a lot of effort over the last several years into cutting costs but the Commonwealth government has achieved very little in real terms. If the Commonwealth government is serious about encouraging investment in Australia in the near future, it must cut its own costs&mdash;showing the financial markets that it is serious about encouraging investment in this country&mdash;thereby reducing its deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investors do not have to invest in Australia. Australian companies and Australian individuals do not have to invest here anymore. They can send their savings anywhere around the world and in fact are doing so. Many major Australian companies are currently investing heavily offshore because they are receiving better opportunities there than here. We must turn that situation around. We cannot force people to invest here. We must change the investment climate to make it attractive for people to invest here. One of the keys to doing that is deficit reduction, which is in the hands of the Commonwealth government. The coalition is suggesting that deficit reduction next year should be closer to two per cent of GDP, not the three per cent which the Commonwealth is apparently targeting. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing that I want to talk about at this stage in relation to the appropriation bills is Senator McKiernan's throwaway line about the sale of schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I will continue to address this issue of financial mismanagement. The issue is looming in Western Australia because of a nasty leak from the education department of a list of 64 schools, the subject of review by the Hon. Norman Moore, the Western Australian Minister for Education. I had a long chat with the president of the parents and friends association of the Coolbellup Primary School this morning. He was very worried, as are many people associated with schools on this list, about the future of his school. Those people have a right to be concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their concerns result not only from the crass leaking of that document but also because Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;a former education minister who should understand these issues better than anyone else&mdash;was unable during her period of government to give any reassurance to any of these schools. Coolbellup Primary School is an example of a school that has had a cloud hanging over it&mdash;to use the words of Evelyn Walker, to whom I spoke this morning&mdash;for a number of years. Carmen Lawrence has been unable to tell people why, in the years when she was the education minister and premier, she was unable to give them any reassurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important issue here is not that of the rationalisation of schools and the delivery of better education&mdash;that is certainly not the issue in the mind of the Australian Labor Party. Michelle Roberts, the Labor Party candidate for the Glendalough by-election, has used this list of schools, leaked by a Labor Party apparatchik within the education department, for base, crass political purposes. While it suits the Western Australian Labor Party to go around scaring parents and citizens by using this internal document for crass political purposes, it does not help in the process of delivering better education services or, as Senator McKiernan said, services to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party in Western Australia failed in its financial management of that state. It failed to deliver educational services to the students of Western Australia. However, the present education minister, Norman Frederick Moore, is going through a sensible process, involving consultation at the community level over a period of months, to ensure that the people of Perth and across all Western Australia are delivered the very best standard of education that the state can offer. They will be much better educational standards than were set under the total mismanagement of the Labor government of Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;the government so ignominiously defeated just over 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to remember with this school closures issue in Western Australia, which Senator McKiernan raised by reference to the advertisement in the papers this morning, is that the process of ensuring adequate educational standards and proper economic management requires a sensible and constructive approach. The use of this issue by Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;who should know better, having been an educator and a minister for education&mdash;is an example of the depths to which she will stoop. She has gone around to parents and friends associations, scaremongering for crass political purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite unfortunate that there has been a development in Australian politics such that serious issues of the kind that Senator Zakharov raises can be raised in this place but cannot be addressed by the opposition in any sane, rational way. The opposition has to put some political slant or slur on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon Senator Zakharov has raised an issue which is important. It relates to the employment opportunities of those with disabilities. I am aware of those press reports, and I am aware of the particular case, but of course I cannot give an assessment of that particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I can say that the government's Disability Discrimination Act came into force just one year ago. It was designed to make discrimination against people with a disability unlawful in a number of areas. Amongst those areas was the area of employment. The definition of disability in the act is broad and I believe it would cover conditions such as epilepsy. The act, of course, applies throughout Australia. Complaints can be lodged with the Disability Discrimination Commissioner through the nearest office of HREOC, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the second part of Senator Zakharov's question, regarding community awareness of this issue, I think it is fair to say that the question of general community awareness of disability issues, the problems of those with disabilities and the capacity of those with disabilities, is very low. Many Australians still do not understand the special problems that people with disabilities face, not only in their normal lives but also in exercising their rights under the Disability Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an integral part of trying to remedy this particular problem, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services have just announced cabinet's approval for the development of the Australian disability strategy and an associated awareness campaign for the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's aim through this program is that we will develop a framework of policies, programs, practices and procedures to improve the equality of opportunity for people with disabilities. The emphasis of this strategy will be on, increasingly, respect for fundamental human rights. On Tuesday of this week both ministers launched the national awareness campaign on what was the first anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the government that the focus of this campaign will be on the disabled seeking employment opportunities in both the government and the private sector and will encourage the notion that people with disabilities should be seen for what they can do, rather than what they cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the awareness campaign, the strategy I talked about earlier is geared towards establishing a 10-year program by the end of this year. The program will have a timetable for achieving national equal opportunity goals covering a host of areas including citizenship, education, employment, income security, telecommunications and the built environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the question related to the Disability Discrimination Act, and the government sees it as a fundamental role in all of our strategies for that act to ensure that people have not only rights but also the capacity to pursue them. Consequentially, we are setting up specialist legal centres in each state and territory in support of that act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Schacht has said, this is another important area where there are stories to be told about Australian economic success in the creation of jobs. Our processed food producers are the most significant manufacturing activity in Australia and employ over 170,000 people. They have traditionally been fundamentally focused on the domestic market for sales growth, but the government and the industry have been working together to encourage manufacturers to increasingly turn to exports. It is estimated that the Asian import market for processed food is now running at more than $US50 billion a year. Australia's geography, agricultural industry and reputation for clean and sophisticated products place us in a prime position to meet this very big and rapidly growing demand in our region, and it gives us the potential to create exports and jobs for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A growing number of our food producers are building solid export businesses in Asia. They are developing long-term plans, building sales, and meeting the tastes of the increasingly affluent middle classes there. The government has developed a successful agri-food strategy and that is providing the framework within which government and industry are working together on this important question. The industry has set itself a target of increasing its high, value added food export products from $2.3 billion to about $7 billion by the turn of the century. If that tripling does take place, then thousands of jobs will follow. There is a very important role for Austrade in this trade promotion area. I think the industry acknowledges that it is performing very actively and effectively. It has initiated a program of joint action groups working with smaller processed food companies to develop their export capacity to enhance that of the bigger companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processed food exporters are also achieving better access to overseas markets through the various government assistance programs such as the export market development, the international trade enhancement scheme, and the innovative agricultural marketing program; and marketing programs are being developed for dairy, processed cereals, wine, seafood and horticulture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue where the government can be of assistance, because the primary responsibility for this lies with the companies themselves, is in reducing barriers faced by our exports. Significant gains were made in the Uruguay round. For example, seafood exports to Japan, which are already worth over $280 million, should benefit from significant tariff cuts achieved there. Dairy exports, which have already passed the $1 billion mark, with the gains made in the Uruguay round can be expected to increase further. We are also working bilaterally to reduce barriers to market access in Asian markets. There is a processed food market access committee, chaired by my department, which coordinates much of this effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very significant opportunity here for Australians, and I and other ministers will be working with the industry to use every opportunity to win better access for Australian processed food exports because it is good for our trade figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for this question because it enables me to join in the theme first articulated in question time today by Senator Schacht, and later by Senator McMullan, that there is a good news story here. Australia has taken a world technological lead by applying aerospace technology to water transport and evolving the most highly competitive means of waterborne mass transport with the aluminium catamaran fast ferry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has supported the industry. The success of the fast ferry shipyards in Australia testifies to the effectiveness of the Australian government's outward looking industry policy in this sector. I will cite honourable senators a few facts. In 1989 the Australian government introduced new bounty arrangements for the shipbuilding industry, including fast ferries for export. Recently the government extended the bounty to 1997 but provided a phasing down from nine per cent to five per cent by 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry goes from strength to strength. It has nearly quadrupled its export earnings in the space of four years. Exports grew from just over $100 million in 1988-89 to an estimated $425 million in the year 1993-94. On current trends it is reliably estimated that the industry could earn $550 million in the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australian shipyards have been a strong element in this export thrust, and the port city of Fremantle deserves a special mention in this case. Austal, an enterprising shipyard in Fremantle, is an outstanding example of this export drive by its effort to penetrate the lucrative but daunting China market. Over the past five years, Austal has delivered 22 aluminium ferries to China, worth over $150 million, most of which have been destined for the south China market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepting China's determination to develop its own high-speed aluminium ferry building industry, Austal is on the threshold of finalising a joint venture agreement with Zhou Jai Du shipyards in Shanghai to produce catamarans using Austal's less sophisticated technology. Thus the joint venture will not diminish Austal's position in south China but will position it for the east China market, which is burgeoning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This joint venture is a good example of the government's policy of encouraging stronger integration of Australian and Chinese industries, as enunciated by the Prime Minister and me in our most recent visits to the People's Republic of China. It will mean that 20 to 40 Chinese technicians will be trained at Austal shipyards to ensure that the joint venture will produce quality ferries. Austal's confidence is reflected in the expansion of its capacity in Jervoise Bay, just south of Fremantle, to produce larger ferries. The company is expected to increase its work force from 250 at present to 350 to 400 in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 March 1994 Senator Amanda Vanstone asked me as the Minister representing the Minister for Justice the following question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the government's failed attempts to protect the copyright of recording artists via the now unconstitutional blank tape levy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Will the Government accept that to increase the sales tax on blank cassettes will simply disadvantage innocent consumers, and be costly to run and inefficient?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the preface to the series of questions, Senator Vanstone referred to the protection of recording artists. In fact the blank tape royalty scheme introduced in the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, and subsequently held to be invalid by the High Court (in Australian Blank Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v The Commonwealth (1993) 25 IPR 1), was to benefit not only recording artists but also the record producers and the composers of the music and words performed. Those same interests will benefit from the new scheme of compensation for home copying of sound recordings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable senator that the Opposition wholeheartedly supported the initiative when the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 was before the Senate in 1989. It was advocated in their arts policy. Senator Puplick said then. . . "a number of initiatives in the Bill were supported by the Opposition because they reflected views which the Opposition had expressed in its published arts policy, namely support for the levy on blank tapes,. . . "</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A blank tape levy to compensate copyright owners for home copying of sound recordings is recognised worldwide. Many nations internationally have adopted levy schemes, including several European countries and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international discussions convened by the World Intellectual Property Organisation consideration is being given to an international obligation to have a levy scheme. Work is also being undertaken by the Commission of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will answer the matters raised by Senator Vanstone: </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) It needs to be said that the licence proposed by Senator Vanstone will increase costs for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1983 survey recorded that approximately 85 per cent of all blank audiotapes bought by consumers were used for home copying. So I am sure that a levy or tax would be recognised by most consumers buying blank tape for private purposes as being a fair quid pro quo for being legally able to engage in home taping. For that small percentage of consumers buying tape for purposes other than home taping music, the scheme being developed will&mdash;as did the invalid scheme&mdash;include provision for refund of the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept that the proposed scheme, which is still being developed, will be costly and inefficient to run. A high priority in designing the scheme is to minimise the administrative cost and inconvenience in its implementation and operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The proposal by the Australian Tape Manufacturers Association (ATMA) has been received only very recently, and I can assure the honourable senator that it is being given serious consideration and consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loading of a licence fee onto the price of all recorded music would disadvantage innocent consumers, those who have no home taping equipment or intentions, just as much as a levy on blank tape. The Government would also need to be convinced that the ATMA proposal would not turn out to be more costly to administer than the levy on blank tape, even if it was as fair to consumers as the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATMA proposal may well be more appropriate in the future when technology has advanced. To that end, I will ask the Copyright Convergence Group, which is looking at future forms of transmission of copyright materials to the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) I am not aware that a licence fee is added to the price of computer software, as an identifiable component of that price. I am aware that much computer software is said to be licensed to the ultimate purchaser, and I understand that that is because the normal use of software involves copying which technically may be an exercise of the copyright owner's rights. On the other hand, the normal use of a copy of a sound recording by a private individual, namely, playing it for private enjoyment, does not amount to such an exercise. I mention that the appropriateness of existing copyright protection of software is the subject of a draft report by the Copyright Law Review Committee issued in June 1993, which it is in the process of finalising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The state of the relevant law is unsatisfactory to both copyright owners, who cannot practically control or secure a return from home taping, and to consumers, who cannot practically seek clearance to engage in non-infringing home taping. This was recognised by the Opposition as well as the Government when the blank tape royalty scheme was introduced. It remains the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move as soon as possible to remedy this by introduction of a levy on blank tape or, if it can be shown to be more effective, by some other scheme such as that proposed by ATMA. Accordingly, I have asked for early advice on the evaluation of the ATMA proposal and the results of consultations on that proposal with copyright interests.</PARA>

<TITLE>Indonesia: Family Planning</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="1385" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Harradine asked me a question about family planning in Indonesia. I promised him a reply as soon as possible. I now give it to him. In relation to the first question that Senator Harradine asked, the joint statement signed on 24 February this year by Dr Haryono Suyono and Mr Gordon Bilney during their meeting in Canberra did state that Indonesia's family planning program was voluntary and non-coercive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Harradine's second question relating to enforcement of Indonesia's target-driven family planning program, as the honourable senator put it, the situation is this: the Indonesian government has not used targets in its family planning program since March 1993. Dr Haryono himself announced the dropping of targets in a speech on quality of care in Indonesia on 8 February 1993 when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By March 1993 BKKBN, the national family planning coordinating board, will no longer use the targeting system in calculating its needs to serve people for family planning. This is simply because people misunderstood our community oriented approach as a target that needs to be achieved no matter what.</PARA>
<PARA>His speech also highlighted the need for client satisfaction to be central to family planning programs. For example, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This commitment should be deeper and broader than simply the contraceptive technicality and its possible difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information service network and contraceptive methods provided to participants have to be appropriate within the existing social network and the social cultural system of the community. It is hoped that the Family Planning Service Network will not disturb the balance and social harmony of the community. Family planning only wishes to become a part of the social community.</PARA>
<PARA>There is evidence to suggest that in the past the implementation of mass family planning programs involved methods which could be regarded as coercive. Dr Haryono's remarks in his speech in February last year quite implicitly acknowledged that. However, the Australian mission in Jakarta has reported that in the aftermath of Dr Haryono's statement last February such incidents are no longer occurring and the central government wants to prevent the community approach to family planning from employing coercive methods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should perhaps add that in Indonesia it is accepted for religious leaders, students, professors, community leaders and the military itself to be involved in all social programs in ways that simply would not be the case in Australia, as I am sure Senator Harradine is well aware. As well as providing information on family planning programs, these groups would be  involved in motivating people to attend immunisation programs, getting village children into school, initiating village clean-ups, promoting attendance at religious ceremonies and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Harradine also asked why Mr Bilney did not `pull Dr Haryono up' in his comments on the promotion of Norplant as a beauty aid. I think Senator Harradine would acknowledge that it is not really appropriate for substantive dialogue with a foreign government minister to be conducted by interrupting answers to questions given at a press conference. Moreover it is the case that Dr Haryono stressed that comprehensive medical screening procedures are in place and that women cannot get access to Norplant without going through those procedures. As he put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the way to inform people and to get them attracted to it, but when it comes to the placement, then you have to go to the doctor, you have to go to the midwife, you have to go to the screening, you have to go to all this kind of nitty gritty before you can get something.</PARA>
<PARA>More generally, can I say that, as Mr Bilney and I have repeatedly made clear, Australian aid funds will not be used to implement in any way advanced coercive family planning programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly on the subject of funding, I should add that no new program initiatives or funding commitments were announced by Mr Bilney with Dr Haryono in their joint statement. It was a statement about general principles of cooperation only, and I am advised that the particular projects listed in paragraph 6 of that statement were all references to prior commitments and acknowledged as such by the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the by-election in Mackellar, it appears that former Senator Bishop has indicated her desire to dismiss three of her staff to provide 11 weeks severance pay, which they are entitled to. The point is, however, that it is one thing for a former senator to claim misuse of public money is totally inappropriate and another for her then to be engaged in that. In the case of the office of the former member for Mackellar, Mr Jim Carlton, I understand from my friends in Sydney that it is in fact still working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public is being asked to fund not only former Senator Bishop's leadership campaign against Dr Hewson but also her campaign for election to the seat of Mackellar.

This information from the staff is provided to the ministerial and parliamentary services group in the Department of Administrative Services. As a result over the last 24 hours it is obvious that staff members and senators can no longer be certain that confidential employment information provided to DAS can be treated in a neutral or confidential way.

We are fortunate that Senator McMullan is here because I have lists about which I would be very interested to hear his views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ryan, for example, received a termination payment of $12,092, and immediately went on to the staff of&mdash;would honourable senators believe it&mdash;the Hon. Ros Kelly. Ms L. Murray received $7,061.67, and went on to the staff of the Hon. John Dawkins. But of course that is small potatoes compared with a few of these figures. Dr Don Russell was on Mr Keating's staff. Perhaps Senator McMullan and Senator Gareth Evans, who are in the chamber, can tell us whether this in fact occurred. My memory is that Dr Russell went off Mr Keating's staff, while Mr Keating was out of office Dr Russell received a termination payment, and then he came back on to Mr Keating's staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The termination payment in relation to Don Russell was $27,000, but that is small potatoes compared with one payout&mdash;really small potatoes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where those opposite say that they are concerned about the facts. Let me make it very clear: no private fact with regard to any of Mrs Bishop's staff has been released by me or by anyone of whom I am aware. The issue of the release of private tax information was raised with me only twice in this chamber&mdash;both times by Mrs Bishop. On two occasions she asked me to release the private tax information of individuals. I refused and she complained about what she called a cover-up. I did not do it and I will not do it. She was the one who thought it should be done. It has happened only twice in the six years I have been in parliament and that was when Mrs Bishop came in here and asked me to release the private tax information of taxpayers and I declined. She felt it should have been released. I did not; I still do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make it very clear how the fact that Mr Wheeler was still working from Mrs Bishop's Parliament House office became public. She put out a press release from her campaign office on 1 March, at the foot of which it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further information: Gerard Wheeler (06) 277 3650.</PARA>

It is an award entitlement to which they are all legitimately entitled and I do not quibble with it. Those people are in no different a position from any others who lose their job and have an award entitlement to a redundancy payment. But when a person sacks an employee because he or she knows that the award makes provision for continuing employment, and there is an intention to continue to employ, that is a conspiracy. It is not the worker who has done anything wrong; it is the person who entered into the conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bit of public information relates to how people knew that the staff of Mrs Bishop had been sacked. It was because Mrs Bishop said they were sacked. I did not know. How did the media find out? Because they asked Mrs Bishop&mdash;and my advice is that she said she had sacked them. How did the media find out that the staff might be re-employed? As far as I can tell, because I did not know, the media asked those employees and they said, `We expect to be re-employed'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that I am not criticising the individual employees who have received severance payments, because that is an award entitlement. I am saying that there appears to have been a conspiracy. The most significant problem is the situation with the offices, particularly the electorate office. My biggest concern is not that the office continues to be used but that, as a result of this conspiracy, that taxpayer funded office, which is supposed to be there to provide services for constituents, has had to be closed. There was no need for it to be closed. Mr Carlton did the right thing and kept his office open and is working in Mackellar. I am sure Mrs Bishop would not go anywhere near that office to get assistance from it because that would not be proper, I suppose. She would not go anywhere near it, would not dream of using it. It would not be doing anything to assist in her campaign, I suppose. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Review of Determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner (`the Report') by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was tabled in Parliament on 11 November 1992. The Report contains a number of recommendations for simplifying and streamlining the procedures for enforcing determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (`the Commission').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (`the SDA'), the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (`the RDA') and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (`the DDA') to put in place a new regime for enforcement of determinations under those Acts by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new regime maintains the protection of enabling the Court, upon application, to examine all the questions of fact and law regarding the complaint. While the possibility of a complainant facing a hearing before the Commission and then a new hearing before the Federal Court has not been overcome, the disadvantages of this system have been limited while maintaining the benefits of the Commission hearing procedures. As all determinations made by the Commission will be registered and enforceable as orders of the Court, unless the respondent initiates an application for review within 28 days of registration, it is to be expected that, in the vast majority of cases, the Commission's determination will decide the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are outlined below in response to each of the Committee's recommendations. As four of the eight Committee members made separate recommendations, their recommendations have also been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the amendments were drafted without the benefit of the Report, they are substantially in accordance with the recommendations made by the majority of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that the Committee's recommendations also apply to the determinations of the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act. The 1992 amendments to the SDA, the RDA and the DDA were part of the Government's Response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the Report of its Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia, entitled Half Way to Equal. Amendments to the Privacy Act to bring its determination enforcement procedures into line with those of the SDA, the RDA and the DDA were in a Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill which was introduced and passed in the 1993 Budget Sittings. That Bill also amended the SDA, the RDA, the DDA and the Privacy Act to allow an application for review of a determination to be brought outside the usual 28 day period in exceptional circumstances and with the leave of the Court. These amendments avoid any injustice which may be caused by the application of an absolute time limit on bringing an application for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations of the Majority of the Committee</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that legislation be introduced to give effect to the following proposals:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is a failure to comply with a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner within 30 days of its making, or within such further time as may be ordered, a party interested or the decision maker be able to register the decision in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the expiration of 30 days, or such further time as may be ordered, the terms of the decision to become an order of the court unless in the meantime a party to the proceedings lodges a notice of objection.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a notice of objection is lodged within the time allowed then the matter will be reviewed in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a party to a dispute before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner is dissatisfied with the decision, he, she or it may apply to the Federal Court within 21 days for leave to have the matter reviewed. The Court may grant leave subject to such conditions as it considers just.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of the Federal Court undertaking a hearing, it may accept in evidence the transcript of the hearing before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner and any exhibits tendered there and may receive such further evidence as it considers just.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislative regime provides that all determinations made by the Commission are to be registered in the Federal Court. Written notice of the registration of the determination must be sent by the Commission to the respondent to the determination within 7 days of it being registered. The respondent then has 28 days from the date of registration to apply for review of the determination in the Federal Court. An application for review may only be brought outside the usual 28 day period with the leave of the Court. In the absence of an application for review, the determination becomes enforceable as an order of the Court at the end of the 28 day period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court, when reviewing a determination, may review all issues of fact and law. Evidence which was not adduced before the Commission may not be introduced in proceedings in the Federal Court, except by leave of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is of the view that the new regime of registering determinations in the Federal Court is a great improvement on the previous regime where, if a respondent before the Commission failed to comply with the Commission's determination, the complainant had to initiate an application in the Federal Court which would then hear the matter afresh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that filing fees not be charged to register determinations in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new procedure, no filing fee is charged to register the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Privacy Act, and, as appropriate, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act be amended to provide a mechanism for the registration of conciliation agreements in the Federal Court along similar lines to the registration of agreements in the Family Court pursuant to s.86 of the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not adopted this recommendation. Conciliation proceedings in the Commission and the terms of any settlement between the parties are confidential. This recommendation raises issues about maintaining the confidentiality of such proceedings and settlements. The Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the Commission, will further examine this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that determinations made against Commonwealth agencies pursuant to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act be enforceable in the same way as those made under the Privacy Act pursuant to s.57(2) of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of determinations involving Commonwealth agencies, the amendments made by the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act provide that the respondent agency or, where relevant, the principal executive of that agency, must comply with the Commission's determination. Where the determination involves damages, application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (`the AAT') for review. A Commonwealth agency or principal executive of such an agency can only seek review in the AAT with the Minister's permission. This regime is based on that in s.57(2) of the Privacy Act 1988 (`the Privacy Act').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be given power to make an order that Commonwealth agencies who are respondents to a matter pay to a successful complainant the amount or part of the amount she, he or it has incurred in bringing the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not adopted this recommendation. The Commission does not have power to award costs against a party to any complaint. The Commission may, however, recommend to the Attorney-General that financial assistance be granted to a complainant after the Commission has inquired into the complaint. Around five per cent of all complaints received by the Commission proceed to an inquiry. The number of inquiries in which a Commonwealth agency is the respondent is, therefore, small. Were this recommendation to be adopted, the Commission would require extra resources to tax costs awarded against Commonwealth agencies. Given that the number of matters involving a Commonwealth agency that proceed to an inquiry in any year is likely to be small, the extra expense involved would be unjustified. However, matters where taxation of costs is required could be referred to another body such as the Federal Court. The Attorney-General's Department will consult with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Federal Court and other relevant agencies on whether implementation of this recommendation is feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations of the Minority of the Committee</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recommend that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission continue to have the function of inquiring into alleged infringements of the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Privacy Act and to endeavour, by conciliation, to settle matters to which the alleged infringements relate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not propose to change the existing functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner to endeavour to conciliate complaints of discrimination and infringements of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recommend that the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Privacy Act, and, as appropriate, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act be amended to provide a mechanism for the registration of conciliated agreements in the Federal Court along similar lines to the registration of agreements in the Family Court pursuant to s.86 of the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above in respect of recommendation 3 of the majority of the Committee, the Government has not adopted this recommendation. Conciliation proceedings in the Commission and the terms of any settlement between the parties are confidential. This recommendation raises issues about maintaining the confidentiality of such proceedings and settlements. The Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the Commission, will further examine this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recommend that where:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has endeavoured to settle a matter by conciliation, but has not been successful; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is of the opinion that a matter cannot be settled by conciliation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the legislation be amended to provide an immediate right of action to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. Allowing the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conduct a hearing of matters which cannot be conciliated gives the parties an opportunity to have the complaint determined by a body with specialist knowledge of anti-discrimination and privacy laws. Commission proceedings also have the advantages, in comparison with court proceedings, of being relatively informal, procedurally flexible, speedy and inexpensive.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PREAMBLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The Report by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs on Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia, tabled on 17 December 1992, has been considered by the Government. The Report addresses regulations and controls relating to the establishment and management of feedlots; the economic, social and environmental impact of feedlots; and the implications of lot feeding for animal welfare. The Government is now in a position to respond to the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The Committee concludes that the beef cattle feedlot sector is a growing and increasingly important part of the Australian beef industry and that lot feeding is a legitimate husbandry tool. The Committee has made several recommendations aimed at promoting the development of an industry that safeguards the environment and has proper regard for the welfare of animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The Government endorses the Committee's recognition of the growing role and importance of the industry. In the Government's view, a strong, responsible, viable and internationally competitive lot feeding industry will be necessary to enable the Australian beef industry to successfully compete in meeting the demand for high quality product in the growing North Asian markets, and as such, represents an important value adding mechanism for the beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The Government shares the Committee's view that the industry must be properly regulated, ecologically sustainable and sensitive and responsive to community concerns. The development of the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia, endorsed by all levels of Government, the lot feeding industry and animal welfare groups will facilitate the development of the feedlot industry in a way which maximises the benefits for all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The Government welcomes the Committee's endorsement of the concept of Animal Care Statements and their inclusion in the National Guidelines. The Government has also endorsed the concept of Animal Care statements as an important self-regulatory means of ensuring the protection of the health and welfare of cattle kept in feedlots. The Government encourages their adoption by all feedlots. In this context, the Government notes the proposed AUS-MEAT Feedlot Accreditation Scheme will require all accredited feedlots to submit an Animal Care Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.The Government believes the proposed self-regulatory AUS-MEAT Feedlot Accreditation Scheme, to be implemented in early 1994, will play a significant complementary role in implementing the principles contained in the Guidelines, and the Government has consequently given in-principle endorsement to the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.The AUS-MEAT Feedlot Accreditation Scheme will gather  comprehensive information on the environmental performance of those feedlots taking up accreditation which, in combination with research being funded by the Meat Research Corporation to measure and improve the feedlot industry's environmental performance, will allay some of the Committee's concerns relating to the lack of knowledge on the environmental impact of feedlots. The information gathered through these processes will be available to refine the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.However, the Government is concerned about the potential environmental impact of small opportunity feedlots, whose activities it may not be practicable to regulate under the AUS-MEAT accreditation scheme because of their small size and transient nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.The Government considers that the adverse impacts of small opportunity feedlots on the environment can be minimised through the application of the principles and the national goals of the Decade of Landcare Plan, which provides for coordinated and cooperative actions to improve land management. The integrated catchment management approaches outlined in the Decade of Landcare Plans of the Commonwealth and State Governments and the guidelines being developed under the National Water Quality Management Strategy will provide a framework, at the local level, for agreeing and setting locally acceptable best management practices to achieve environmental and socio-economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.The Department of Primary Industries and Energy contributes towards the funding of improved resource management, including catchment management activities, under the Decade of Landcare through the National Landcare Program (NLP). The objectives of the NLP, which encourages a long term strategic approach to the management of land, water and related vegetation are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to promote partnership between the community, industry and government in the management of natural resources;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">assist in establishing institutional arrangements to develop and implement policies;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">assist in developing approaches to help resolve conflicts over access to natural resources in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is developing Commonwealth-State Partnership Agreements to implement and achieve the objectives of the NLP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.The Partnership Agreements will have two parts: an overarching statement of objectives and principles that will guide the development of joint Commonwealth/State action strategies to be implemented under the aegis of the NLP; and  a number of schedules addressing agreed priority outcomes. Provision of financial assistance for initiatives will be established within a broad framework including achievement of milestones and outcomes advancing the objectives of the Agreements. The schedules will cover issues such as clean rivers and healthy catchments, sustainable production and resource management, urban water resources management, community action and awareness, and monitoring and evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.The Partnership Agreements may provide the opportunity for the States and Territories to incorporate the issue of proper management of small feedlots within the broader priorities of sustainable natural resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.The Property Management Planning Campaign being organised under the NLP provides the opportunity for land owners and managers to acquire resource and financial management skills that will assist them in managing their properties based on the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.Landcare groups provide the community support and encouragement to land owners and managers to achieve sustainable resource management. These groups also provide information and skills to land owners and managers and, in most cases, have established effective networks which enable them to access State and Territory resources to complement their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.Given the potential of feedlots to impact adversely on water quality, the Government believes that feedlot proposals should be assessed in terms of their impact on the catchment in which it will be located and in terms of its compatibility with any catchment management objectives. The Government also believes that the environmental management of feedlots, including small or opportunity feedlots, should be consistent generally with the policies and principles of the National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS), and in particular, the principles and best management practices outlined in the national guidelines being developed to manage water resources in the rural environment. The NWQMS is being developed jointly by the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ, combining the former Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand, Australian Water Resources Council and Australian Soil Conservation Council) and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.The main principle underlying the Strategy is to pursue the sustainable use of the nation's water resources by protecting and enhancing their quality while maintaining economic and social development. The Strategy proposes the adoption of a complementary package of regulatory and market-based measures to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.Guidelines are being developed under the strategy to provide a point of reference when issues are being determined on a case by case basis. Consistent with the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia, the guidelines are aimed at providing a shared national objective while allowing flexibility to respond to differing circumstances at regional and local levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.The NWQMS Guidelines for Managing Water Resources in the Rural Environment, currently being developed, will provide nationally agreed principles for managing water resources in the rural environment consistent with ecologically sustainable development to address:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the use of best management practices to reduce the adverse  impacts of all forms of landuse, including intensive rural industries, on water quality, such as nutrient pollution and salinisation; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">manage water resources in the rural environment on an integrated basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.In accordance with action arising out of the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, which provides for sustainable land and water resources management, the Government believes that the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia and the NWQMS provide the policy basis for promoting best management practices to ensure that feedlot operations do not adversely impact on the environment. The Government believes the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGEA) will provide a mechanism for the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments to adopt the principles of the Guidelines and the NWQMS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.The draft Algal Management Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin was released for public comment in August 1993 by the Hon Simon Crean MP, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in his capacity as Chairperson of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. The draft strategy also provides a framework for coordinated planning and management actions to reduce the frequency and intensity of algal blooms and other water quality problems associated with nutrient pollution arising from sources, such as intensive agricultural industries, in the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.The Commonwealth Government will move quickly to implement those recommendations which it supports and which fall within its responsibilities. Those matters which fall within the responsibilities of State and Territory Governments will be brought to their attention through ARMCANZ. While recognising that responsibility for deciding whether or not to implement these recommendations rests primarily with the State and Territory Governments concerned, the Commonwealth Government urges that a nationally consistent approach be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.Several of the recommendations relate to amendments to the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia. In such cases the Government is concerned that the cooperative approach that was evident in the development of the Guidelines be continued, and consequently these recommendations will be passed to the Standing Committee on Beef Cattle Feedlot Guidelines for consideration when the National Feedlot Guidelines Workshop is reconvened. The Workshop is due to be reconvened in 1994 to consider the operation of the Guidelines and any amendments that may be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.The Government will request the Subcommittee on Animal Welfare (SCAW), which developed the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals&mdash;Cattle, to give consideration to those recommendations relating to the Model Code in the context of SCAW's commitment to review the Model Code regularly to take account of advances in knowledge. SCAW is due to revise the Model Code in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.The Report makes recommendations relating to research into the environmental and animal welfare aspects of lot feeding. The  Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will request the Meat Research Corporation (MRC) and the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation (LWRRDC) to give consideration to these recommendations when they are reviewing their research and development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.The MRC, along with other Commonwealth rural industry research and development bodies, is funded from industry levies matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth Government up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the relevant industry. The LWRRDC was established to fund research related to sustainable management of soil, water and vegetation resources considered to be in the public interest and is funded fully by the Commonwealth Government. While the Government does not determine which individual projects are funded, it would expect the annual operational plans and five year research and development plans, to be submitted by these bodies for the approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to include an appropriate level of research devoted to the environmental and animal welfare aspects of lot feeding. The Government has introduced legislation into the Parliament to incorporate ecologically sustainable development objectives into the MRC's charter. The Government also notes the MRC is already undertaking significant research into the environmental and animal welfare performance of feedlots.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.It must be recognised that these Commonwealth research and development bodies are not the sole research funding organisations and that the States and the private sector also have a role and responsibility. There is a place for a coordinated research effort and in this respect the Commonwealth research and development bodies are well positioned to ensure there is an effective network of research into beef cattle lot feeding. The MRC already cooperates with the LWRRDC in programs focused on sustainable beef production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28.The Government's responses to each of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs' conclusions and recommendations are set out in the attached schedule.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.On the basis of evidence presented during the inquiry, the Committee considers that the beef cattle feedlot sector is a growing and increasingly important part of the Australian beef industry. The industry represents a significant value adding process for livestock, with gross value of production in 1992 estimated at over $800 million. With over 70 per cent of production destined for overseas markets, the industry makes a notable contribution to Australia's export performance.  Feedlots also confer economic benefits on other Australian industries, particularly the grains industry, and to rural and regional economies in general.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that there is concern in some sectors of the community about feedlot developments and, in particular, the threat they pose to local amenity, the environment and animal welfare. These concerns cannot be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the development of the industry and considers that the feedlot industry must be properly regulated, ecologically sustainable and sensitive and responsive to the community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Committee's support for the development of the beef cattle feedlot industry. The Government supports the view that the industry must be properly regulated, ecologically sustainable and sensitive and responsive to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The Committee acknowledges that it is difficult to develop detailed, comprehensive standards for feedlots across Australia, as there are significant differences in climate, topography, population densities, soil types and the availability of water. It is in this context that the Committee welcomes the development of the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, the Guidelines provide a useful framework against which State and Territory Governments can develop detailed legislative and administrative arrangements that provide consistency and certainty to the feedlot industry and, at the same time, have due regard for the environment, the local and wider community and animal welfare.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that proper siting and sound management of feedlots are fundamental to achieving a responsible feedlot industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the approach adopted for the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia which provides a broad framework of generally acceptable principles for the establishment and operation of feedlots. Australia is comprised of diverse climates, environments and ecosystems and adequate environmental protection of these will not be achieved through prescriptive national guidelines. The Government considers the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia will  encourage a consistent approach to the management and operation of feedlots and provide the basis for more detailed guidelines, laws and regulations to be framed to take account of the specific circumstances of feedlot developments in different geographical regions throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The National Guidelines and Model Codes of Practice</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Given the prospects for growth in the industry and the special nature of lot feeding, the Committee recommends that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in conjunction with the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand, develop a specific model code for the welfare of cattle in feedlots and that this code be incorporated into the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the provisions of the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals&mdash;Cattle that are not specifically directed at cattle held in feedlots are still relevant to such cattle. Additionally, instances of producers maintaining both extensive and intensive cattle systems on the one property through the establishment of small opportunity feedlots have become more common. In these circumstances, the Government believes it appropriate that the one code of practice covers both husbandry systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does acknowledge that the code could be improved to clarify the relationship and remove the inconsistencies between the body of the Model Code and the appended Code of Practice for Cattle Welfare in Feedlots developed by the Australian Lot Feeders' Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government will request the Subcommittee on Animal Welfare, which developed the Model Code, to give consideration to this recommendation when it is next revising the Model Code. Approved changes to the Model Code will be incorporated in future revised editions of the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The Committee endorses the view presented in reports of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and supported by RSPCA Australia, that State and Territory Governments gazette model codes of practice and guidelines endorsed by the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand to their respective legislation relating to prevention of cruelty to animals.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The Committee is concerned that the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that was evident in the development of the National Guidelines may be jeopardised by differing views about the form and content of Animal Care Statements. The Committee, therefore, calls on the Australian Lot Feeders Association and animal welfare organisations to resolve these differences.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the evidence before it, the Committee endorses the concept of Animal Care Statements and their inclusion in the National Guidelines.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the concept of Animal Care Statements as an important self-regulatory means of ensuring the protection of the health and welfare of cattle kept in feedlots and encourages their adoption by all feedlots. In this context, the Government notes the proposed AUS-MEAT Feedlot Accreditation Scheme will require all accredited feedlots to submit an Animal Care Statement. The Government also notes that Queensland will make completion of an animal care statement a condition of licence for all existing and proposed feedlots, whether or not they seek AUS-MEAT accreditation. New South Wales will also seek completion of an animal care statement by all existing and proposed feedlots.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The form and content of the Animal Care Statement has been agreed to by welfare, government and industry representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.The Committee welcomes the formation of the National Feedlot Guidelines Standing Committee to monitor and review the  implementation and application of the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia. The Committee regards this initiative as a clear indication of a continuing commitment to the development of the feedlot industry in a way that is both efficient and responsible.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.The Committee welcomes the proposal by AUS-MEAT, entitled Feedlot Accreditation Scheme&mdash;A Quality Assurance System for Beef Feedlots in Australia, whereby only a feedlot that complies with industry standards, including environmental and animal welfare codes, and maintains quality requirements can have its product certified as grain fed for the domestic or export market. As was stated in evidence, one of the benefits of the scheme will be to force feedlots to lift performance or get out of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, the proposal, which is similar to the successful AUS-MEAT Abattoir Accreditation Scheme, has considerable merit as it links accreditation with quality assurance and the commercial benefits of product description. The AUS-MEAT proposal is based on the principle of self regulation and, as such, provides the industry with a mechanism to prove itself to be "an acceptable and responsible corporate citizen in the management of a human food resource and the environment". If the industry fails to respond to the challenge of self regulation, the Committee considers that stringent government control and supervision may be necessary to ensure compliance with environmental and animal welfare standards.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Accreditation Scheme may, however, have limitations in its effectiveness in monitoring the performance of some smaller opportunity feedlots. These feedlots are transient by nature, making it difficult to develop an effective monitoring mechanism for their operation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.It is clear from the evidence that several factors, including the much publicised death of several thousand feedlot cattle in Queensland, have tarnished the public image of the industry. The industry is fully aware of the situation and advised the Committee that it is making a concerted effort to improve the industry's standing with the public.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.The Committee was told on numerous occasions that feedlots have a significant potential to pollute but did not receive assurances that the actual environmental impact of feedlots is minimal, because there is insufficient information on the matter. In this regard, the Committee notes that the report entitled An Investigation of Nutrient Pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin River System found that nutrient balances provide no obvious indication of any substantial pollution from feedlots but recognised that this finding is based on very limited data and therefore is inconclusive.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of information available about the environmental impact of feedlots in Australia is of great concern to the Committee. The absence of comprehensive, accurate or specific information has hampered significantly the ability of this inquiry to make judgements about the environmental performance of the feedlot industry, or recommendations for change. It is the Committee's view that this dearth of information also has important implications for the ability of feedlot operators and regulatory authorities to predict with assurance the impact of proposed feedlot developments and to measure the actual impact of the industry as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address the problem, the Committee recommends two courses of action by industry and government. First, the Committee urges the Australian Lot Feeders Association, having regard to commercial confidentiality, to provide data and other technical information that would assist regulatory authorities, researchers and public inquiries to aspects of environmental impact.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.Evidence to the Committee confirms that stress, disease and behavioural problems can be minimised if cattle in feedlots are able to fulfil their behavioural requirements. Pen space, therefore, is an important factor in meeting these requirements.</PARA>

The Committee's view is that the minimum pen space of 9m(2), recommended by the Australian Lot Feeders Association, is too small and considers that a minimum of 15m(2) to 20m(2) per animal, as recommended by the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare, will enhance the welfare of cattle in feedlots.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I welcome the government's response to the committee's report on beef cattle feedlots. In particular, I note its support for 28 of the 29 recommendations or major conclusions contained in the committee's report. The committee tabled its report in December 1992 and unanimously recorded its support for the development of the industry, but considered that it must be properly regulated, ecologically sustainable and sensitive and responsive to community concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response sets out in detail the work that has been done, and will be done, to achieve these objectives, including the recent introduction of an Aus-meat feedlot accreditation scheme. National guidelines for beef cattle feedlots in Australia have also been developed and endorsed by all levels of government, the lot feeding industry and animal welfare groups. I welcome the government's support for those recommendations made by the committee to fine-tune these guidelines and the model code of practice for welfare of animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to environmental concerns, the committee noted that feedlots should not pose a threat to the environment if they are properly designed, managed and regulated. However, the committee expressed concerns that more research needs to be done on the environmental impact of feedlots. In this regard, I particularly welcome the government's response that the Meat Research Corporation is funding research into the environmental impact of feedlots and abattoirs. I understand this program of research will consist of 17 projects with a budget of $3.25 million. By June 1996 it aims to collate and disseminate existing good environmental practice information; improved knowledge of the industry's existing environmental performance; and identify or develop and trial appropriate waste minimisation and treatment technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that the committee's inquiry into beef cattle feedlots was timely and its recommendations practical and constructive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs tabled this report in December 1992, as the chairman, Senator Burns, has already said, following 12 months of investigation, during which time we received 27 submissions, conducted eight public hearings, took evidence from 44 witnesses and visited 10 feedlots, from Texas in the north to Wangaratta in the south.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We restricted our inquiry to beef feedlots, although the actual reference was simply to lot feeding in Australia. The committee was of the view that dairy feedlots&mdash;there is one at Broken Hill; it is an outstanding feedlot&mdash;involved different criteria, and the majority of submissions received related to beef feedlots, in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response today is largely supportive of the committee's findings. That does not surprise me, as it should not surprise anyone involved in the inquiry. The recommendations we made were sound and appropriate for the development of an industry that has significantly contributed to the export wealth of this country. It is a major player in the domestic beef industry and an example of agricultural value adding&mdash;the rural buzz word of the 1990s. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that this committee, of which Senator Burns is chairman and I am deputy chairman, is now going to hold an inquiry into value adding in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to traverse in detail the entire committee report and the government's response. They are on the public record for anyone who wishes to have a look at them and for anyone who is interested. However, I do wish to comment on some of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the government did not appreciate the area of conflict currently existing between the national guidelines for beef cattle feedlots in Australia and the model code of practice for the welfare of animals&mdash;cattle. One could argue the relevance of model codes and how well they are adhered to in any situation. It is probably true to say that the large scale feedlots are so controlled in any event as not to breach the model code. However, there is still potential for substandard husbandry in opportunity feedlots&mdash;those feedlots run by farmers on their properties to take advantage of particular market situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am encouraged that at least the government has referred the matter to the appropriate committee for consideration when the code is next revised. I am pleased the government has responded to the committee's suggestion to include the RSPCA on the committee which will look into national feedlot guidelines. I also welcome the involvement in that committee of the Cattle Council of Australia and local government representatives. I am also pleased that producer concerns about the large involvement of foreign investment in Australia's feedlot industry&mdash;notably that of the Japanese&mdash;will continue to be monitored. There is no denying that we need their investment but it must be mutually beneficial. In relation to that issue, we need to make sure not of the amount of foreign investment we have here but the amount of competition flowing from that foreign investment both in Australia and in different countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also endorse the involvement of local government in feedlot development. It is, after all, local government that has to contend with local complaints about noise, effluent, traffic, the building of roads for feedlots and so on. Local government must maintain the roads surrounding the feedlots. Of course, those roads get a great deal more use when feedlots are installed. To that end, local government and other authorities must be kept informed of the environmental impacts feedlots have on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, technical data has been scanty and vague. The long-term implications relating to the siting of some feedlots are not being monitored. The committee has recommended that the Australian Agricultural Council sponsor a comprehensive environmental audit which the government has endorsed in principle. An important point to be borne in mind is that when local councils build feedlots in their areas they are not taxed out of existence. Local councils recognise that feedlots produce income for their district. One must also recognise that they bring employment to the districts which can only be beneficial. Therefore, local councils must give help to the feedlots to make sure that those benefits adhere to that district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic significance of the feedlot industry cannot be over emphasised; it has altered the face of agriculture irrevocably. It is currently estimated that there are 480,000 cattle in feedlots throughout Australia, and there are 1,000 feedlots in Australia at the moment. While the capacity of feedlots to produce cattle is now in excess of 550,000, about 1.1 million cattle now go through feedlots every year in Australia. By the turn of the century that figure will rise to a million cattle in feedlots at any one time, with sales out of those feedlots of around two million head of cattle. So there will be great expansion. Some $800 million worth of gross value of production is now coming out of those feedlots. It will help our exports and every other part of the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that issue, I think we have to be mindful of the fact that the Australian Lotfeeders Association has requested the Meat Research Corporation to investigate the quantity of cattle and grain that will be available in the year 2000 to sustain the industry. The markets will be there, and it is very important that we make sure that there will be enough grain and enough cattle to fulfil that aim. We should prepare for that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the equation will be the role that the cooperative research centres, such as the one in Armidale, play in monitoring consumer demand. Monitoring consumer demand has been pursued exceptionally well by this industry; it has done a much better job in that regard than a lot of other industries. It is very important that this effort continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedlot industry has affected the types of cattle being bred, methods of selling and the volume of crops grown for the feedlot industry. Their economic significance cannot be overstated. In praise of Australia's beef cattle producers I have to say that they have responded magnificently to this new industry. A number of cattle breeds and, more importantly, cross-breeds are being developed especially for the feedlot industry and the Japanese trade. It has provided a wonderful floor to the industry and is responsible for the particularly buoyant outlook for cattle, as indicated in the ABARE conference last month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perennial argument about grass-fed versus grain-fed and saleyards versus direct selling will not be resolved in the short term and indeed that may never happen. However, the development and expansion of the feedlot industry has undoubtedly made an indelible mark on the Australian beef industry. There is now more direct selling now and more bypassing of the saleyards. Once the cattle have gone into a feedlot and the money has been spent on them, they are handled with kid gloves so that there is no bruising, no stress to the animals so that the meat on the hoof at that particular stage gets to the abattoirs in top condition and in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Husbandry in the feedlots that we visited deserves our commendation. The aim is to look to the interests of the animals and also to the profit at the end of the process. Bruising has been reduced to an absolute minimum as a result of feedlots. We now produce beef to specification for just about any market anywhere in the world. I would like to think we can produce beef better than anyone else, but of course cattlemen in the United States and South America make the same claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia seeks to produce meat at a most affordable price. What worries me, however, is that, despite the cost, meat consumption in Australia is static at around 36 kilograms a head and has fallen over the last ten years. This is a great pity. The AMLC is concerned at the static number, and one can only assume that if it did not pursue a massive promotional campaign, the consumption rate would fall even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question asked at the ABARE conference was: why does the consumption rate remain low? The answer given was that until consistency is achieved in taste and tenderness, people will continue to buy chicken and other alternatives. By the way, I do have a pecuniary interest: I breed beef. I make that clear to any honourable senators who have any illusions that I do not. Beef producers and processors need to be aware of those market criticisms and address them. The process must involve moving to a better description scheme, brands or some other form of identification so that butchers know in every case where the meat they buy came from, otherwise buyer resistance will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedlot industry, however, has provided an opportunity for the retail sector to sell consistent beef product, just as the chicken industry is consistent with its product. It is now the responsibility of others in the beef industry to work more closely to benefit. If housewives in Japan are able to buy first-grade consistent product, so too should Australian housewives. That they are not able to indicates a breakdown in the system. The technology and the feedback are available. To a large extent, we have the advent of the feedlot industry to thank for that. The feedlot industry will never entirely supplant the grass-fed beef industry, but it creates an enormous expansion of choices for producers. Therefore, the feedlot industry should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government's response to our report and I am encouraged by its positive approach. I wish the industry well because we in Australia handle value adding very well. Now that the government has not bent to the arguments put forward by some of the environmental minority groups, it is supporting an industry that is doing a great job. It is to be hoped that the industry will go on to bigger and better things to produce income for Australia, a better standard of living and a better standard of animal welfare care for all animals in those feedlots in future. </PARA>

<PARA>This is an important report of the significant land council that operates on Bathurst and Melville Islands to the north of Darwin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking again this year at the annual report, I am pleased to note that the Tiwi Land Council has taken the appropriate responsibility across a very wide range of issues that are important for the Tiwi people. I would certainly commend the chairman, Walter Kerinaiua and his fellow members of the Tiwi Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activity that takes place on the Tiwi islands is always highlighted and probably best noted because of the prowess of the Tiwi people as participants in Australian rules football.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one issue that I would wish to address today and specifically bring to the attention of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had representations in the Northern Territory that the Tiwi barge enjoys quite a considerable franchise with regard to the operation of freight services to the Tiwi islands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a significant and important report. Because of the focus of this Senate in the last 12 months on many issues either arising from appropriations for Aboriginal and Islander people, or alternatively, in dealing with the legislation that related to native title last year, it has been a most important year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also highlight that 1993 was the Year of Indigenous People, and therefore much activity flowed, and much attention was attracted to this particular portfolio. The report of ATSIC is comprehensive, and in this five minutes I cannot do justice to the areas that I would like to comment on. In particular, I would like to commend the work of the commissioners and the staff of ATSIC in dealing with what is obviously a hard and comprehensive series of changes that are going on in the Australian community at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all well aware of the initiatives of the government that have been backed up by this parliament in the necessary areas of priorities for reconciliation in our community and, at the same time, the other activities and responsibilities that must be attracted to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure many of my colleagues on all sides and within all parties of the parliament would agree, we cannot expect activity in the Aboriginal and Islander portfolio not to be without controversy. Change can only be achieved in this portfolio by pushing many of the issues through controversial debate and through extensive consultation with Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one area that I would choose to focus on in the few minutes available to me here is the program generally known as CDEP, the community development and employment project scheme which was introduced in 1977. This scheme has expanded in recent years with a lot of government largess, but at the same time it is important to focus on the effectiveness of it. In general I would praise most of the projects that have been accepted and adopted, and the efforts of many Aboriginal people throughout Australia in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But again, it is not without controversy and it is not without the deserving need to concentrate on the areas that need criticism or need critical comment in much of that program. I would suggest that in many of the areas of the CDEP scheme there needs to be an involvement of a joint venture arrangement, either with state and territory governments or alternatively with many operators in commercial ventures throughout Australia. Only when we can introduce the skills and the talents that are available in the wider community into such an important area of employment and projects, can Aboriginal people fully benefit from such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would draw attention to the many pages in the report that refer to all of the evaluations, the audits and the schemes that impact on CDEP. They are important. I would highlight in particular the table on page 42 of the annual report which schedules and sets out the undertakings of the types of activity undertaken across the various divisions of the state regional areas, and then the activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do highlight that in that particular schedule much of the focus is on what I would term a non-commercial bias or activity in employment. Therefore, I hope that ATSIC will be open to the challenge of reorienting much of that schedule away from areas&mdash;and I am not criticising them&mdash;where the major focus is on women's activities, youth activities, administration, child care, providing a garbage collection and health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are necessary local government and municipal functions, but in turn they do not produce a new dollar. Employment in those areas does not generate dollars for the benefit of Aboriginal people. I would like to see the scope of much of the CDEP focused into the areas of park rangers, pastoral leases, retail, wholesale, tourism, furniture making, and market gardening&mdash;areas which I would identify as being important and which have a much more commercially oriented focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other matters that I would like to comment on in this report, in particular areas such as rural industries around Australia and the reviews that are under way. I am aware that ATSIC has recently commissioned a major and expensive consultation on the whole area of land management. It certainly needs a lot more attention, but in general this report is a faithful and proper report on the activities of ATSIC for the financial year. </PARA>

<PARA>The Central Land Council organisation operates essentially in the central to lower regions of the Northern Territory and is administratively based in Alice Springs. The number of communities on which its activities impact is very large. The council covers the areas bounded by the Western Australian, South Australian and Queensland borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, probably for the first time in a number of years, this report has taken a particular emphasis. In past years I have commented that the annual reports of the Central Land Council have been very appropriate and have appeared to be administratively correct with the council carrying out its functions of looking after its constituency interests of the Aboriginal people in Central Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the focus in this report for 1992-93, whether it is the authors that are involved or whether it is a shift in emphasis or change of people involved, now largely reflects a very political view. There are quite a number of comments, I would say, that take swipes at and criticise the Northern Territory government without, I would argue, good and just reason and without the balance of activity that I would like to have seen. I am disappointed that the Central Land Council has moved in that direction. This sort of commentary was generally reflected for a number of years in the reports of the Northern Land Council. I hope that it is not just a matter of a few staff changes where staff have transferred from one place to another and suddenly we end up with a report that does not achieve its objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reports should be a reflection on the activity of the important organisations that they serve. They should reflect the efficiency of the administration across so many areas that are inter-involved, and it should be accepted that the land councils are not in themselves political organisations. They are not alternative levels of government; they do not have municipal or local government functions. They ought not to be imposing into the area of state or territory-type politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a certain extent it is interesting to note the number of Labor politicians whose photos appear in both the report of the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council this year. Of course, whilst I am sure many state and territory ministers, and perhaps opposition members and senators also, had consultations or detailed discussions with these organisations, there is not a visual accreditation of that side of it. Rather, it is a trenchant criticism that I do not believe genuinely reflects much of the discussion that would happen at the level of the board of directors from the people that I know with whom I have had many valuable and appreciated discussions throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the financial sections once again the Central Land Council has reported very properly on the areas relating to royalty payments, et cetera, that flow. This of course is important. In the area of finances, both the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council reports, the latter of which I hope to comment upon shortly, rely very heavily on additional top-up funds that have been made available to these organisations in addition to the statutory rights that they receive under the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account from mining royalties. But the extent to which their administration has blown out beyond all proportion, in this case some $3 million to $4 million beyond what is statutorily provided, is at the expense of development in other Aboriginal organisations or for other Aboriginal people. To that extent, I am disappointed. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a very important report because it focuses primarily on the area of corporate activity and investment relationships that are undertaken by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. In past years I have commented on the activities of this organisation, and I am pleased to note once again the very important focus on commercial developments that do have an employment related scope for Aboriginal and Islander participation. I know personally the chairman of this organisation, Gatjil Djerrkura of Nhulunbuy on the Gove Peninsula. Mr Djerrkura's commitment, along with a number of other commissioners, is reflected in a very satisfactory report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the summary of investments that were undertaken in the financial year reflect investment approvals of some $33 million. That is very pleasing to note. In the review of the activities of this organisation again I am pleased, especially from a Northern Territory perspective, to note that much of the activity is diverse. In this case it reflects on participation in a goldmine at Mt Todd; in tourism participation at Nitmiluk Gorge, formerly known as the Katherine Gorge; in a fishing lodge on Bathurst Island; at the Kings Canyon Resort in Central Australia, which again has a major tourist focus; and in Alice Springs in a joint venture of Central Australian Aboriginal groups with the former proprietors to operate a motor vehicle dealership and service centre. Given the usage of motor vehicles by Aboriginal people in many remote communities, this sort of project is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that this is a very satisfactory report that ought to be noted. It should receive wide publicity, perhaps much wider publicity than a lot of the social commentary that is often attracted to this portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This trust account has received a great deal of political focus in the last 12 months. I have certainly continuously raised its activities and its financial dealings in the estimates committees. In May of last year a very serious report was produced through ATSIC and its audit offices by a consulting firm, Walter and Turnbull. What transpired was a discovery that reinforced many previous findings that had not been acted upon, that there had been a very serious depletion of the trust funds of this particular organisation. I think from recollection the depletion was in the order of $10 million, which is of course a major loss, given that the income from this trust account is derived almost entirely from mining royalties that are properly due as the personal and private property of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Walter and Turnbull report of May was subsequently followed up with a strategy that was developed by ATSIC and Walter and Turnbull, and that was reported to the September and October estimates committees. I am very critical of much of the administration of this particular trust account because the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, ought to have been aware for a number of years of the mucking about, which is the only way I can describe it, that happened with this very important area of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the advisory committee comprised the directors of the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council and the regional director of ATSIC for the Northern Territory who had almost total control indirectly of this considerable trust fund in that period, and they allowed that serious erosion to happen. I have pointed out that both of those personnel from the CLC and the Northern Land Council have moved on. Mr Mick Dodson has moved on to become the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Social Justice Commissioner. I hope that the federal government absolutely scrutinises every activity that he undertakes and reviews them in light of the activities in which he had a culpable hand when allowing this very serious depletion of funds that is properly the property of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Ross, the past director of the Central Land Council, has recently taken up a senior ATSIC position in Canberra, and has therefore come out of the scene as well. I hope that part of the politics of those moves has been that the minister has seen it necessary to replace all three members of that advisory committee. Whether Mr Dodson or Mr Ross have gone to other jobs, or Mr Castine from ATSIC has disappeared out of the face of ATSIC, is indicative of the seriousness of this particular account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not walk away from the very important requirements where there is an obligation of trust. It is similar to a solicitor operating a trust account. This is very much the personal property of Aboriginal people, and the fact that there was such a serious depletion of funds will mean for many years Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory will be denied access to proper grants for sport, which are terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the activity of the Aboriginals Benefits Trust Account reflects on land management and funds that have been made available for the purchase of pastoral properties. In that area we must always ensure that it is not just the one-off grant of land, whether it is under the guise of a pastoral lease which then subsequently disappears off the operating viability of the pastoral estate but into an Aboriginal land estate, but a recurrent level of funding that will go on to support the community based areas that are so very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is dutiful in that it indicates the problem, but I do not believe it highlights the seriousness of the issues raised and the problems that were experienced by this trust account during the financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise to honourable senators that I am, once again, critical of the annual report of the Northern Land Council. For the last three or four years I have always risen at this point to express my concerns about much of the activity and the financial and administrative complexity of the Northern Land Council. Last financial year I had cause to raise some very serious issues in the Senate estimates with regard to the operation of the Northern Land Council. It is pleasing that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) found it necessary to institute a major inquiry by the Auditor-General into the activities of the council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be aware that that report was tabled in December 1993 and recommended some 52 areas of significant change to administration of the council. Also pleasing is that the new Director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Darrell Pearce, is grappling with each and every one of those recommendations. I wish him well. It is hoped that by the end of this financial year he will have the budget in some degree of order and all of the issues that were raised in the Auditor-General's report&mdash;which were very serious in nature across a whole range of activities&mdash;will be properly brought into view</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I am critical of the politicisation of much of the activity of the Northern Land Council. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the Aboriginal councils have very specific administrative and proper constitutional representation needs for Aboriginal people. Both the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council far exceed the charter given to them under that organisation, and the politics would happen better in other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, like that of the Central Land Council, reflects much of that unnecessary political sniping and commentary based on the activities that many of these people are experiencing. I do not believe it is a reflection of the wide Aboriginal constituency to which they look to the land councils for a proper role. I am not denying the right for that political voice to be properly expressed and heard, but I do not believe it is through the agencies of these organisations. In that sense, the report reads much more like what should be on feature pages of weekend newspapers by appropriate Aboriginal leaders around Australia, and ought not be presented in parliamentary reports in such an editorial manner with political comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, unfortunately, the audited statements of this particular organisation have had to be qualified by the auditor. This is a serious matter, particularly when it has gone on for a number of years and the auditors have found it necessary to qualify their report. It is an indictment on the auditors that they did not qualify their reports in past years sufficiently or adequately, because what arose in the December 1993 report into the Northern Land Council reflected on the administrators and bureaus of the land council, and very seriously on the ministers and those who must accept political responsibility in this area. But, when the auditors can call into account issues of capital expenditure, approving budget items by more that 20 per cent, and can note that the Northern Land Council distributed over $500,000 contrary to the disclosed intention, these are indeed serious matters of administration to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Akin to my comments as to the Central Land Council, I note also that the top-up funding that was required for administrative purposes in this case of over $4 million for the Northern Land Council was at the expense of Aboriginal people throughout the northern part of Australia. That amount was required for administrative costs in addition to the $3.8 million allocated by statutory right under the legislation. In this financial year, the administration costs in this particular land council came to well within the order of $8.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted also that there has been a very serious depletion in the cash flow and cash available to this land council. The accumulated fund in the balance sheet as at 30 June 1993 was over $2 million; this year it is down to $667,000. There has been a depletion in that particular account which is very considerable and demands urgent attention. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The purpose of that is to ensure objectivity and, from the point of view of the public analysis of the work of the committee, to ensure that the public is confident that the findings are not driven by political motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judge or senior counsel could play a prominent role in the examination of witnesses and in advising the committee on areas of its inquiry and on its findings. In fact, I would hope that the committee would invite the judge to put findings of his own into the record of the committee's determination. In other words, I would hope that the report of the committee would include an independent assessment of the facts by this judge or senior counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter because we are determining the proper response of the Senate to what amounts to a prima facie case of political corruption. We believe that evidence now before the parliament would lead an objective person to come to no other conclusion than that this particular program was not motivated by the objective of helping communities in the development of their facilities but was primarily motivated by the intention of the ALP to use public funds for political benefit. I put it to the Senate that when one looks at the materials that have now come out of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and at the materials that were available earlier that came out of the estimates committee and other inquiries of this Senate&mdash;I will run through some of that material shortly&mdash;there is no other real conclusion that one can reach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is correct, what action should the Senate take? The government is putting to us and to the Australian people that it has been brought to account already in that a minister, Mrs Kelly, has resigned; that the parliament should therefore be satisfied and the matter forgotten. In many ways, the attitude of the government was demonstrated by the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in putting the architect of this scheme, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Richardson), the only other minister who had administered this scheme, back in charge when Mrs Kelly resigned. That demonstrates that there is no acknowledgment on the part of the government that there is anything for which it must publicly account at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we accept that attitude, then, in our opinion, the Senate would be abdicating one of its primary responsibilities; that is, to do everything reasonably possible to bring the government to account for improper conduct in the administration of the public purse. We believe it would be a very disappointing day if the Senate did not pick up the challenge clearly before it to analyse the material that we say amounts to political corruption. If the committee and the judge appointed to the committee are of the conclusion that it did amount to political corruption, they must say so, and allow the public to require a proper accounting by the government for its misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the responsibility of the parliament. I do that by making two references. One comes from the first page of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;which part, I suspect, was written by the officials rather than the Labor majority. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament must do all that it can to ensure that public monies are not only properly appropriated but that they are used in the most effective and efficient way possible in the best interest of the people.</PARA>
<PARA>That sentiment, which we totally support, is supported by the Auditor-General at page 2 of his letter of 9 February 1994 to the honourable member for Fraser, Mr Langmore, as chairman of the House of Representatives committee. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public confidence in the actions of ministers requires that the propriety of their decisions is seen to be beyond reproach.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are very well aware that care needs to be taken to avoid anything which would weaken public confidence in the processes of government and which would result in damage to the standing of the Parliament as an effective reviewer&mdash;-on behalf of voters. . . This would raise the danger of reinforcing any cynicism in the community about the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums it up well. It is clearly saying to the parliament, `You have a responsibility in this matter to take it to its logical end. Do not allow the government to avoid responsibility by taking the easy way out and accepting the resignation of a minister'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me pursue that one step further. If the minister had resigned because of a finding of political corruption, that would be a different matter&mdash;but that is not what occurred. When we look at the committee of inquiry of the House of Representatives, which basically looked at the scheme as administered by Mrs Kelly&mdash;not what had gone on before in the administration of the scheme under Senator Richardson&mdash;we find that the majority of that committee were not even prepared to make a finding that she should be censured. All that the majority really said was that she was incompetent in relation to her administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of that committee did not face up to the primary challenge that was before them of determining whether or not there was political corruption on the part of former Minister Kelly in the administration of this program. In effect, she was found guilty by the majority of not keeping adequate records to enable a proper accounting of the reasons for which she favoured one application over another. According to the majority of that committee, she should be criticised for that lack of proper accounting; for her maladministration. There is no doubt about that; but that was not the principal challenge before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal challenge that was before that committee, and is still before this parliament, is whether she was giving $30 million of taxpayers' money to certain groups in a way that was designed to maximise the political benefit to the ALP. I regret&mdash;but I guess it is a factor of the numbers in the House of Representatives&mdash;that the majority of the committee did not address that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should take it one step further and say that the primary distinction between this place and the House of Representatives is that the government does not have the numbers in this place and it cannot get away with what it was able to get away with in the House of Representatives; that is, bringing down a report that although critical of her&mdash;no doubt that helped in the negotiations with the Australian Democrats&mdash;did not address the principal concern of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one, however, looks at the political bias that is evident in the distribution of these funds, one is again reminded of that by the Auditor-General who picked up the allegations of political bias&mdash;as shown on page 10 of the Auditor-General's report No. 9&mdash;when he referred to the fact that Labor seats, which accounted for 53 per cent of the House of Representatives seats, received 73 per cent of the number of grants and 66 per cent of the value of grants approved. He said that, on average, the total value of grants to a Labor-held seat was $257,000 and to a coalition seat it was $141,000; and, on average, the total value of grants to a marginal Labor-held seat was $326,000 and to a coalition-held seat it was $163,000&mdash;facts that obviously caused the Auditor-General deep disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He nevertheless acknowledged that it might be possible that this prima facie evidence of political bias might be able to be explained away for some other reason, such as if it could be demonstrated that, astonishing though it may be, the grants did go to the areas of greatest need. The Auditor-General acknowledges that he had not done that task; in other words, he does not see it as his responsibility to go that one step further and make that assessment as to the motivation of this scheme and whether it is just being used by the government as an enormous slush fund for political advantage. But this parliament not only can but should do that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report of the committee details a number of major shortcomings in the inquiry that took place in the House of Representatives. In particular, the dissenting members were concerned that the former departmental secretary, who was secretary during most of the period in which the fund operated, Mr Tony Blunn, was not called to evidence. The majority voted against calling him to give evidence. Ms Kaye Dal Bon, whom I will refer to in a minute, and who had been critical of the administration and what the department was being required to do, by the determination of the majority was also not called to give evidence; nor were Mr Phil Ruff and Mr Ken Bennett from the minister's staff, who had a key role in the ALP's marginal seats campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fascinating coincidence, Mr President, as you would no doubt have noted, that the person who had responsibility for the ALP's marginal seats campaign was Senator Richardson. We find that the chief staffer who had the responsibility for it was working on the staff of former Minister Kelly, advising her on the distribution of these funds which, by another incredible coincidence, seem so much to favour ALP marginal seats. He obviously should have been required to give evidence. However, the majority of the committee were not of that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the inquiry therefore being inadequate in that it did not call all available evidence to reach its conclusions&mdash;in other words, it made conclusions not on the full availability of evidence&mdash;it did not in the majority report address the other evidence of political bias that came out during the course of the inquiry. Page 5 of the dissenting minority report quite adequately lists many examples of that. In this debate today I do not want to go through them all but I have mentioned that three-quarters of the grants went to ALP seats, which seemed to be an amazing coincidence. I mentioned the fact that the quantum of each grant was much greater for ALP electorates and that the average value of grants to marginal Labor electorates was much higher than for other Labor electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that some of those other Labor electorates, the safe Labor electorates, contain the lowest incomes in our community. One would have thought, without any other evidence on the table, that they may well have had greater need and greater demand for these public funds than those that happen to be marginal Labor seats. Interestingly, in South Australia the metropolitan seat with the lowest per capita income would be Port Adelaide and probably the next lowest would be Bonython. Yet they received only approximately half the money&mdash;about $200,000&mdash;that was made available for each of the marginal Labor seats. Of them Hindmarsh received $461,000, Adelaide $430,000, Grey $368,000, and Makin $400,000&mdash;an amazing coincidence!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people on this side of the chamber who take a particular interest in rural Australia will no doubt say the poorest of all in Australia at the moment are in the rural communities. For example, Wakefield, which may well be that seat, got $171,000&mdash;less than half the average that this minister gave to each of the marginal Labor seats in South Australia. Again, perhaps there is an explanation that I have missed; but the coincidences, really, are just too much to accept. As we go through this list that was produced by the dissenting minority in the House of Representatives inquiry, one notes that Labor target seats were listed here as being favoured seats&mdash;for example, Bendigo, Corinella, Hotham, Melbourne Ports, Wills, Hindmarsh, Adelaide, Makin, Kennedy, Herbert, Leichhardt, Hinkler, Moreton, Rankin, Calare, and on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approved category 3 applications favoured ALP electorates over coalition electorates by 59 to 18; and in Queensland by 15 to one&mdash;and on it goes. The only application ruled ineligible by the department but that had funding approved was in a marginal ALP seat, the seat of Dickson. The only grant above $50,000 provided without matching funding was in a marginal ALP seat, the seat of Hinkler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six of the seven late applications funded were in marginal ALP electorates. Other late applications of course were rejected. The only cases of grants being made in excess of $250,000 per project ceiling were in ALP electorates&mdash;the seats of Watson and Perth. Many grants, including those in coalition electorates, were made to organisations with strong links with the ALP. In some cases, ALP candidates announced successful grants, even though the sitting coalition member had not been advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Bendigo the minister personally directed potential applicants to the ALP candidate, Mr Helper, not to the coalition member of parliament. The minister initiated extensive consultations with many ALP members in determining which grants should be successful in their electorates. Contacts with coalition members of parliament were rare. Extra funds were supplied and a record number of grants were announced just prior to the 1993 federal election. No new funds were provided for the program in the post-election budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications were classified by electorate before the application of grants was decided. We know about the notorious leaked minute to the Honourable R. R. Willis from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, which referred to potential grants in his electorate and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could you please look at the attached and pass on your comments by Friday afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA>It had a big `confidential' on it. We note that that electorate was stated at the top of the minute to be a safe Labor electorate. In other words, when the minister considered the applications, she had before her a designation of the electorate according to whether it was politically important in the forthcoming election. That fact itself is so vital in assessing what her motivation really was in choosing one application over another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successful applicants were notified by personal letter from the minister and unsuccessful applications merely got a letter from the department. Do you remember, Mr President, the explanation of Senator Richardson as to why the department was not being involved? It was because it was a difficult matter and he did not want to cause embarrassment. Yet when people were unsuccessful he was quite happy to have the department write to them and tell them they were unsuccessful. If they were successful, of course, there was a political benefit in his writing&mdash;or, in this case, former Minister Kelly writing&mdash;to the successful applicants to tell them what he had been able to achieve for their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Completed projects are required to erect a plaque to commemorate the government's contribution. Electorates which demonstrated a need by providing the largest number of applicants did not get the largest number of grants, and one can go on. The mere fact that there was no published criteria in itself demonstrates that the basis on which the minister chose one applicant over another can only be described as highly suspicious. Honourable senators can read the full list of the evidence of bias that was simply collated by some members of the House of Representatives and included within that report. At the very least it must, in the eyes of any reasonable person, raise a very deep disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have been talking about is the administration of former Minister Kelly. But the architect of the scheme, the first minister administering the scheme, was Senator Richardson. Senator Richardson in this place the other day tried to suggest that he might have inherited it from former Minister Brown, the minister who became somewhat notorious in here for other reasons relating to his business arrangements with the Prime Minister. In fact, he did not inherit this scheme from Mr Brown. Mr Brown's scheme was a national scheme. The scheme that Senator Richardson put together&mdash;very shrewdly, one must acknowledge; politically shrewdly&mdash;was a community based scheme whereby he had the opportunity to determine which communities should benefit, and deliberately, in his intention that the department should not take a role in the selection of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the only example I know&mdash;honourable senators might remind me of others&mdash;of a scheme divvying out public money in this way; where there is no advice from the department as to the merits of one applicant over another but, rather, it is determined by the minister in his office with his political staff, in the case of Senator Richardson, or on the whiteboard, in the case of former Minister Kelly, with her political staff. I do not know of any other instance where it was done in this way. So one again asks why. I have demonstrated that the explanation given by Senator Richardson that it would be too awkward for the department simply does not wash. Why is it too awkward in relation to grants under this scheme and not in relation to grants under the arts scheme, the environment scheme or one of the others? No explanation is given for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, when we look at what happens in practice, the fact that the department was hauled back in to tell the unsuccessful applicants that they had missed out, really demonstrates that his case fails. What one must suspect is that the department was not involved because the minister wanted to divide this public money in a way that benefited the party rather than to ensure that the best applicants, the most needy applicants, the most worthy cases were, in fact, those that were rewarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell, Senator Parer and Senator Baume&mdash;and they have not received sufficient credit for it&mdash;picked up this area of concern back in 1990, with the first grants being made by Senator Richardson. We put these matters to Senator Richardson, as you remember, Mr President, in question time two days ago. We wanted to bring this matter on yesterday because it was the day following Senator Richardson's failure to give a reasonable explanation as to why, for example, in Western Australia, 75 per cent of the 1990 grants went to Labor held electorates which comprise only 57 per cent of the electorates in Western Australia. There is no explanation as to why the marginal seat of Canning received 35 per cent of Western Australia's total allocation. There is no explanation as to why, in Queensland, seven marginal seats received 75 per cent of the grants and five of those seven were Labor held and two were marginal coalition. There is no explanation as to why, in New South Wales, one-third of the funding went to just four marginal Labor seats, with 14 per cent going to just one seat, the seat of Calare, Mr Simmons's; two marginal Labor seats, Calare and Hunter received $400,000 of the $1 million that was spent on Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister had the opportunity in this place two days ago to explain how that occurred in a way that could convince the Senate that it was for reasons other than political bias, that he was not part of what we can only fairly describe as political corruption, and he failed to give any real explanation of that at all.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that he had gone out publicly earlier and said that they went to Labor seats because the Labor seats were the poor in the community and had the greatest need. That was the defence he made for former Minister Kelly some days before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have now been able to demonstrate is that the seats which had the lowest per capita income in fact did not get the same benefits. The seats that really benefited, disproportionately benefited, were those for which disproportionate political gain could be achieved. That is the evidence that has built up from 1990 right through to the recent inquiry, which I have described as a sort of part inquiry into the sports rort affair by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a satisfactory explanation that no-one on the government side has yet put, one can only conclude that that is evidence that would lead any reasonable person to the conclusion that not only was this a politically biased program but also it was set up primarily for a political purpose to advance the Labor Party's interests and put in the hands, firstly, of the architect of the ALP's election strategy, Senator Richardson, for that objective and then carried on by Mrs Kelly on his instructions. For that, they should be condemned and they will not be condemned unless this chamber, with its numbers, is prepared to do the hard work and make the findings.</PARA>

The second thing to point out is that this working group, established after the Marshall Islands affair&mdash;I remember all the emotion on both sides of that debate&mdash;lapsed due to lack of interest because the opposition did not appoint an opposition senator to it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that, just as the standards of the 1980s for what is expected of us as individuals are no longer appropriate in the 1990s, the duties of ministers, the complexity of legislation, the increase in the amount of technological change probably means that we have different needs of and put different demands on ministers these days. It could well be that there is a more appropriate use of delegation, but complicating that is the factor, as the Pearce report pointed out, that we have had a huge increase in the number of ministerial staff as compared with departmental staff. I am not saying that that is inappropriate; I am simply saying that there has been a real blurring of the lines as to what is appropriate responsibility for all of these people, including ministers, and it is about time we sorted it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (5) of my amendment addresses the matter of a register of pecuniary interests of senators. It ensures speedy consideration of this matter, which has been before the Senate for 10 years. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was either incredibly ill-informed or incredibly mischievous when he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Real Life</EMPHASIS> program that it was the fault of the Democrats that this had not happened. The fact of the matter is that it has not been for lack of Democrats support. Certainly there has been some negotiation on amendments but we have been ready to vote for this register for a long time now. The reason it has not been brought to a vote is that we have had a filibuster. We talked it out, the government took it off the agenda and it has not come back. Part (5) of my amendment means that, if this amendment is carried, the matter will come up for debate on 14 March when we return to this place. That is the substance of my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell honourable senators why I oppose Senator Hill's motion&mdash;why I do not think an inquiry is the best route to follow in this instance. I acknowledge the importance of Senate committees. I acknowledge the importance of the way in which we have shared the chairs of those select committees in this chamber&mdash;I acknowledge that&mdash;but I also acknowledge the opportunities for politicisation of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am interested in the difference between Senator Hill's first terms of reference and his name for the committee, and the redrafted ones. The first name was a `select committee for an independent inquiry into sports grants'. The second one is a `select committee for an inquiry into certain government accountability matters'. That is a big improvement; a very interesting acknowledgment of the language and focus. I think the first draft shows a very clear indication of focus and motive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In plan A, the first draft proposes a commissioner, who is or has been a judge of a superior court, be appointed to assist the committee. The second draft proposes to appoint a commissioner who is or has been a judge, or is or has been a senior counsel. The first draft proposes a quorum of three members, a neat little subcommittee&mdash;it could even be three Liberals. The second draft proposes a quorum of four members. The first draft proposes advertising the inquiry's sittings in the media. The second draft widens this to inviting the public to make written or verbal submissions. The first plan proposed a six-member select committee with the standard two Labor members, three coalition members and one Australian Democrats member. The second draft proposes a seven-member committee consisting of two Labor members, three coalition members, one Democrat member and a member nominated by the Greens (WA) and Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main difference between what my amendment is proposing and what a Senate inquiry may or may not achieve is that my package delivers a committed outcome. A Senate inquiry may make findings and recommendations; and the House of Representatives and the government may ignore them, as often is the case. I argue that it is more constructive for us to use existing parliamentary avenues, such as the estimates committees, which the opposition has used in this matter very effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even possible to suggest that the Auditor-General has a look at the administration of the program under Senator Graham Richardson.

I am not a fan of continuing the politics of muckraking, and that is the big risk in the opposition's proposal. I am sorry, but I really have to say that it is part of the opposition's motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill said that the matter must not be forgotten. I agree with him. What do Australian people want from this situation? They wanted Mrs Kelly to resign, I believe, and she did. They want to make sure it does not happen again. My package will commit this government to a much greater degree of accountability than ever before, and one which is a substantial improvement. I wonder whether the opposition, if and when it ever wins government, would be prepared to sign a statutory declaration here and now that, if in government, it will never be tempted or seize an opportunity to indulge in a little bit of old-fashioned pork-barrelling, which I am now saying is inappropriate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That figure did not include time spent on Senate . . . proceedings by ministers and their staff . . . Finance Department in its coordinating role, the costs of typing and printing documentation . . . the cost to the parliament of mounting estimates committee hearings&mdash;the cost of staff, research done by the parliamentary library, the Hansard costs, or money spent on coverage of hearings by parliament's sound and vision unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only mention that as something that should be considered. We are tempted to think of the inquiry as the only avenue open to us&mdash;and it is, if one's motives are those of crudest politics. But there are constructive opportunities that we in this parliament can take. I have chosen to take the route of negotiation. I argue that this accountability package is a step towards more open and honest government without having to wade through a cesspool to get there. I argue that we should replace Senator Hill's motion with a forward-looking, not a backward-looking, accountability agenda which recognises the mistakes that have been made and seeks to move on. I conclude by quoting from the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 2 March 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coalition has in the aftermath of Mrs Kelly's resignation sought aimlessly to spin out the sporting grants affair. It wants to establish a Senate inquiry that could only amount to a fishing expedition. By contrast, . . . the Democrats produced a sensible case for reform. The Government and Coalition would do well to respond in a positive fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it is about&mdash;avoiding the politics of muckraking and taking the opportunity to put a constructive, forward-looking agenda in place. It is much more cost effective and, I would say, a much more of-the-nineties, appropriate way of moving forward. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me track over each of those points again in a little more detail. An inquiry, as I said, would not be about exposing the issues that have been involved in the administration of this program or, indeed, any other program like it, because there have already been two very far-reaching inquiries which have done just that&mdash;the Auditor-General's report, with its recommendations, and the House of Representatives committee report, with its findings, very adverse to the minister and to the government, and its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What new information could we possibly get out of this inquiry that is not already on the table? We know all about the processes that were followed&mdash;the guidelines, the respective roles of the department and the minister's staff, the Auditor-General's and other people's views about the question of fraud and about what needs to be done in the future. There is nothing new in it. It is a backward-looking waste of everybody's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill, of course, claims that a further inquiry is needed because the Auditor-General's inquiry and the House of Representatives committee inquiry did not sufficiently investigate the whole question of allegations of political bias. Of course, that question was very squarely raised by the Auditor-General. He concluded, having looked at it, and with full access to all the documentation involved, that he could not resolve it. That question was also looked at by the House of Representatives committee which, in its majority report, found that, while there might be an inference of bias, there was no reliable documentary basis for going beyond what the Auditor-General had concluded. And this was in a report by a Labor majority which did not pull its punches; a report which talked about serious inadequacy of the minister's record keeping; which talked about the minister's management being deficient; a Labor majority report which was so scathing and so devastating, so negative in its impact, that the minister felt she had no obligation but to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in this exercise is the way in which statistics can be employed to conclude almost anything, and will continue to be employed in that way, in an environment where conclusive proof is simply not available, and it is not available, of course, because the documentary evidence, as we all know, does not exist. Of the statistical games that have been played, I can retail, for instance, the very adverse publicity given to Mrs Kelly's administration of this program at one stage during the proceedings, where it was said that only nine per cent of her approvals were in the category one area, which was obviously of the best qualified projects; 80 per cent of them were of much less qualified category two proposals; and 11 per cent were in category three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those same statistics&mdash;and they were devastating in their impact, I think, in creating a climate of concern about this affair&mdash;were properly looked at, they were quite different in their impact because it became clear that nine per cent of the total number of grants made happened to be of the category one type, but since only a very small number of grants had been in category one to begin with, even though 58 per cent of all grants coming forward in category one had been approved by Mrs Kelly, because those grants in total were only a small proportion of the overall number, the figure was as low as it appeared to be&mdash;nine per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give that as one passing example. In fact, she approved 58 per cent of category one applications, 26 per cent of the 2,000 or more in category two, and 14 per cent of category three applications. A different perception was brought to bear on exactly the same figures, producing a different prima facie conclusion about the nature of the enterprise involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, that was the case on the question of late applications mentioned by Senator Hill. There was a very detailed answer given in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on that question of late applications, why those were accepted and others were not, in response to a question on notice by Dr Wooldridge. That did not get the attention it deserved by way of explanation. Similarly, the Pine Rivers band issue and the saga associated with that, which equally had a rather devastating public impact in creating the perception that something had gone fundamentally wrong, was readily and quickly explained as a case where there had been a difference of view in the department as to whether the grant in question was of a capital kind. The department said, `Contact the minister; make representations to the minister if you don't like our finding'. The grant applicants did so and they got a decision accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these examples not in order to track back over this territory but to remind honourable senators of how much does depend, when one is engaged upon these sorts of inquiries, upon what kind of information is out and about and how one chooses to scrutinise it. I say, quite simply, even if honourable senators do not give weight to the majority report of the committee, even if they give all the weight to the report of the minority&mdash;the issues that Senator Hill was emphasising&mdash;they are never going to get any further than we have got so far today, because the inherent nature of this particular material is not such as to produce conclusive results on the question of political bias. It will never do so because of the manifest inadequacy of the documentation involved. It will never do so because of the whole way in which the program was administered&mdash;in a way that was over-reliant on the discretion of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one has a program which is administered on this basis, with very little reliance on objective criteria, material coming from the department, and a great deal of reliance on individual discretion being exercised by the minister, one is always going to have arguments about political bias and those arguments are never going to be resolvable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we had in this particular inquiry was all those issues clearly and frankly exposed. They were exposed, bringing out the statistical compilations in a way that is going to give rise to endless further argument but no further conclusions. So why a new inquiry is not going to expose any further, in any public interest relevant way, the issues that are involved is because the inherent nature of the material that is going to be before such an inquiry, if it were to be set up, is not such as to enable firm conclusions to be drawn. That is what happened in the House of Representatives committee, with all its coercive powers. That is what would happen in a Senate committee with whatever powers it was vested with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that this inquiry would not be about bringing the government to account for deficiencies that have been revealed. The government has been brought to account. We have been lacerated. We are lying bleeding and wounded on the floor and one minister has lost her ministerial head as a result of it. And that is the ultimate sanction in the political business. We cannot get a more savage kind of reprisal than that. The ultimate political price has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been brought to account, not only through the wounding months when this particular issue was being so much the subject of adverse public comment, but in a very direct and immediate way through the fate of this particular minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me come to that. The third point I want to make is that this would not be about forcing the government to acknowledge that more needs to be done in addressing the issues that arise. I say that because the government has already acknowledged that more needs to be done. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), so far from shafting anybody, in his contribution to public debate on this issue in a Perth radio interview he did the following day made it absolutely clear that he frankly acknowledged that there had to be much greater accountability in the way this particular system operated. There had to be much greater reliance on departmental documentation and classification and much less reliance on ministerial discretion. That is not shafting the Auditor-General; that is agreeing with the central recommendation of the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central recommendation of the Auditor-General has been already frankly accepted, openly accepted, at the highest level of this government. The government is prepared to accept that more can be done and that more specifically can be done to strengthen the powers of the Auditor-General. Mr Beazley has made that clear in public statements, in the documentation that has just been tabled and incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> by Senator Kernot. He has indicated that, in the context of this debate, we would be prepared to go down the path of redrafting the Audit Act, introducing that redraft for speedy consideration and addressing in the course of that redrafting process a whole series of issues that have been raised by Senator Kernot going to the independence and the capacity of the Auditor-General to do his job. We have acknowledged, frankly, that more can and should be done in that particular area. I do so again now: we will go down that particular path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the further point that any such inquiry exercise would not be about identifying what further improvements could be made in the accountability process because, to a very large extent&mdash;I think to a comprehensive extent&mdash;those sorts of issues are before us. Maybe there will be some further issues brought out by honourable senators in the course of this debate. The issues are before us in the form of the 16 specific recommendations about this program that were made in the Auditor-General's report from page 17 onwards&mdash;some of which, by their nature, are applicable to similar discretionary programs elsewhere and not specifically confined to this. Similarly, with the five recommendations in the House of Representatives committee report on page IX, which spell out again some very specific suggestions for improving the operation of this particular program. Those sorts of proposals are clearly a general application to similar kinds of grant programs elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the agenda of issues that have been identified. It has been identified in Senator Kernot's amendment now before us. It is an agenda which extends to picking up and applying those specific recommendations of the Auditor-General and the House of Representatives committee; an agenda which goes to the reconvening of the parliamentary working group and the development and implementation of a code of ministerial conduct; an agenda which obliges us, mercifully at last, to pick up the pecuniary interest question; and, most importantly of all, an agenda which goes specifically to the question of a whole series of potential improvements to the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that, if there is any doubt about what the government would do if this particular amendment were passed, if there is any doubt about whether the government would actually take notice of such an amendment and act accordingly, I will seek leave to put that matter beyond doubt by making an appropriate ministerial statement at the conclusion of this debate if this amendment is accepted and adopted by the Senate in the way that is being proposed. So it will not be just a matter of the Senate passing a resolution; it will be a matter of having some very firm ministerial commitments on the record. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course I know why those opposite want an inquiry. If I were in their shoes in opposition, I would want an inquiry for exactly those same reasons: to get going on a fishing, a trawling expedition to see what might turn up, Micawber-like. That is what those opposite are about. They are not about acting in the public interest to identify the rights and wrongs of a particular program. They are not about getting into this sort of inquiry in order to identify with more precision, more specificity and more detail particular accountability provisions or improvements. If they were about doing any of those things, I might just be tempted for half a minute to believe that there could conceivably be some justification for this inquiry. But that is not what they are about; they are about a political muck-rake exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any lingering doubt that that is what they are about, let us have a look at the way in which they propose to construct this inquiry. Let us have look at the membership of the committee. What do they propose to do by way of the membership of this committee? They propose to have three members from the Liberal-National Party coalition; two members out of the 30 government senators&mdash;that is, three from their side and two from ours&mdash;one from the Australian Democrats; and one, God help me, from the Greens; and, with the utmost respect, Senator Harradine. We have a 3, 2, 1, 1 situation. We have a situation where the government is being asked&mdash;for the first time, I believe, in the history of this Senate&mdash;to accept a committee situation where we have just two out of the seven places on this particular committee, and that is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lived in the past with standing committees where the majorities have been constructed on a 3, 3 basis&mdash;three on the government side and 2, 1 for everyone else. We have lived with situations in standing committees where they have been constructed on a 4, 4 basis&mdash;four for the government and 3, 1 on the other side. We have even lived from time to time with select committees, because we have had no choice, constructed on a 3, 3, 1 basis&mdash;three for us, three for the coalition and one for the other minority parties and Independents in this place. We have never, in the history of this Senate, been asked to live with a situation of just two members out of seven on a committee like this. That is a demonstration, clear and stark, of just what a travesty of an exercise those opposite propose this committee to be. It is there. It is self-evident on the face of the matters of the motion, and they stand condemned by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very peculiar feature of this motion that those opposite ask the Senate in all seriousness to accept is the proposal for a judicial commissioner or person assisting the committee. The only time that has ever been implemented in the past was the very special, unique, hopefully never to be repeated circumstance in 1984 where two former judges were appointed as commissioners assisting the Senate committee in the context of the Senate Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conduct of a High Court judge&mdash;the potentially criminal conduct of a High Court judge&mdash;was something that went absolutely and fundamentally to the heart of the administration of justice at the highest levels in this country. It was obviously an issue of manifest seriousness; obviously an issue involving potentially criminal behaviour; obviously something demanding professional resources and skills that were beyond those of members of the Senate at that time; obviously something demanding very special circumstances&mdash;very special institutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What on earth is there about this particular committee that justifies or demands anything of the kind, or anything at least of the vast fees&mdash;quite apart from anything else&mdash;that are involved in setting in train an exercise of this kind? What is it about, except to lend some kind of spurious cover or colour of judicial decency to what is an inherently indecent political exercise? That is all that is about. It can have no other rationale; no other justification. Nobody has accused any aspect of this particular program of having been maladministered in any criminal way. There has been no hint or skerrick of evidence of any kind. It is not that kind of exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kind of exercise is a program that was manifestly maladministered in ways that we know about, and that we know what to do about for the future. We know what to do about it for the good reason, in the first place, that we paid the political price and, in the second place, because we have become acutely conscious of the kind of administration that is simply not justifiable, is not sustainable in the public interest in these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it boils down to. As Senator Kernot said, there is a hard, stark choice involved in this particular matter. We can go down the path that is being urged upon the Senate by Senator Hill. This is backward-looking, wholly political exercise, designed not to advance the public interest in accountability; not designed to create new machinery, new ideas, new proposals, new ways of dealing with particular administrative problems that have shown up in the past, but simply a political exercise designed to give possible solace, possible nourishment to a party desperately needing and feeling the urge to have such a diversion&mdash;feeling the urge for such a circus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have that sort of choice on the one hand&mdash;a backward-looking, politically-motivated manifest exercise of that kind&mdash;or we have, with the Democrats proposal, a forward-looking effort, designed to directly engage, without any further delay, without any further need to delay, in a series of specifically focused, quite precisely targeted efforts to improve accountability, which the government in that context is prepared to accept. </PARA>

The first amendment inserts a preamble at the beginning of Senator Hill's motion to acknowledge the government's move to make important changes to the Audit Act, to bolster the powers and independence of the Auditor-General early in the spring session of this year; to set a timetable for responses to the House of Representatives standing committee report into the sports rorts affair, and to implement a code of conduct for ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These make up three of the four initiatives that I understand were agreed to between the government and the Australian Democrats. It would be quite understandable for the public to think that all such measures should be a matter of course. None of these measures should require some specific agreement between parties outside this chamber. They certainly should not then be used as they are used and were used to threaten us against proceeding with a full inquiry into this affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth measure, a register of senators' interests, is one that has our full support. It is a matter that has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Introducing it at this juncture is purely an attempt by the government to regain some of the high moral ground. If senators wish to implement such a register, then I hope that they will support the motion, of which I gave notice this morning, when it is moved on the next day of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment serves to clarify the role of the commissioner assisting the committee, and to enhance the objectivity of the committee's direction and focus. It deals with ensuring that the commissioner to be appointed by the committee has a clear role in the taking of evidence by the committee, and in the deliberations of the committee. This will serve the useful purpose of avoiding the muck-raking that people have expressed concerns over&mdash;but I also add that you cannot trawl muck if there is not any muck to trawl. So the government should be reassured about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have supported the formation of this committee on the basis that it really can get down to some objective analysis of the issues at hand. The only way of doing that is to ensure that the commissioner has a specific role. The principles underlying the Greens (WA) support for this motion revolve primarily around the fact that this government has shown a consistent disregard for accountability to the people through the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which it has addressed the issue of the sports grants is only one recent example. We see it at all times when the role of the Senate, as a house of review, is disregarded or made fun of, or even attempted to be threatened. We see it at every point where this government refuses to table matters that are requested before this chamber. This is simply one more example, and it is one more opportunity for the government to address that inconsistency of accountability that it demonstrates to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no admission of guilt; no acknowledgment that improper, if not corrupt, conduct has occurred. It is the sheer arrogance of an executive which allows the allocation of $30 million of taxpayers' money, and smiles in the face of a total absence of justification and documentation, and simply scapegoats the minister for incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, is that incompetence in covering tracks, or in failing to be able to explain away the unexplainable? Any individual taxpayer who has answered the taxation department's queries, and any community group that has been hauled through bureaucratic hoops to account for every cent of federal government grants is outraged at the obvious disregard and abuse of government responsibility that has been demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community is familiar with pork-barrelling. The people know it has been tried on by almost any major party with sufficient resources at its disposal. This inquiry is not simply an inquiry to expose this practice, or allow anyone to hold the high moral ground and use the information in a party political way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot spoke of the need for accountability. The honourable senator also referred to the change of Western Australian state governments as a result of exposure of corrupt practices referred to as WA Inc. She failed to mention that without the royal commission into WA Inc. the matters which were brought to light might never have become accessible to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package agreed to by the government and presented in the Democrats' amendments is worthwhile and should be supported. However, three questions need to be asked: why have the Democrats not already done this; why is this package to be conditional on not having an inquiry; and why, if the government is demonstrating such a desire for accountability, is it not moving the amendments? It needs to move the amendments itself to demonstrate the genuine political will for such accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if we let the government arrange a package to get out of facing the parliamentary committee process which it consistently flouts, we will have done nothing to stop the arrogance of the executive, as demonstrated by the way the Labor Party has utilised taxpayers' money and by its weak response to the House of Representatives committee. The House of Representatives inquiry particularly highlighted the need to identify and put in place more transparent processes and better accountability mechanisms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Keating did not admit any guilt, but the fact is that it was causing damage to the Labor Party's standing. Senator Richardson, after a relatively short term in the wilderness, is now back as a senior member of the cabinet. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the Australian Democrats did not support an inquiry into that matter was that Senator Evans suddenly came up with the brilliant idea that the issue was not to go trawling to find out what the problems were and to get involved in muckraking. As Senator Evans put it at the time, `Let us deal with the future. What we need is a ministerial code of conduct'. Senator Coulter, the leader of the Australian Democrats at that time, reversed his position and said, `We will not support an inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. What we will do is support'&mdash;would you believe it&mdash;`an inquiry into a ministerial code of conduct chaired by Mr Leo McLeay'. Of course, nothing happened as a result of that particular inquiry. I suspect that had we had the full inquiry, had we found out the full facts of the case, this particular scandal would not be before the parliament today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues will not be resolved by Senator Coulter and Senator Kernot receiving certain assurances and support from the government for particular changes. I have looked at the letters which have been tabled, exchanges between Senator Kernot and Mr Beazley, and all they give us is some idea that the government will move in a particular direction. But we do not know what that direction is. Senator Evans will not tell us. We do not know what Senator Evans has promised Senator Kernot and others. As Senator Chamarette put it so well, if he was fair dinkum about accountability, if he truly recognised the problems thrown up by the various reports of the Auditor-General and the House of Representatives committee of inquiry, he would put those proposals on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Evans, in an astonishing twist to this debate, has said that he has a package that he will put on the table but that no-one trying to weigh up this issue, particularly on our side, will be able to see these proposals until this particular motion is lost. We are simply not prepared to buy that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has said that we are muckraking and trawling&mdash;exactly the same approach he took in relation to the Marshall Islands affair. We saw it again in relation to the Brian Burke affair. It is the typical government response. If Senator Evans and others in the Labor Party believe that this inquiry will show up nothing, what on earth are they worried about? I suspect that there is a prima facie case for very serious concern on the part of the Labor Party and that is the reason it does not want an inquiry. For the sake of accountability in government we must root out this cancer at the heart of the system once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sports rorts issue is not one which can be resolved by simply saying that it has been mishandled by a minister and that it is sufficient that the minister has been removed. Senator Evans was very careful not to admit that there was any bias in this system. I believe the reason Senator Evans was very careful not to admit there was any bias, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is that he knows what such an admission would mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there has been a deliberate attempt under this program to rort the electoral system&mdash;to use massive amounts of taxpayer money in the lead-up to an election to secure a major advantage. Just look at the scale of this sports rorts program. In 1990 all the political parties together, including the minor parties, spent a record $32 million. After the 1990 election the Labor Party came back into this chamber and said that this was straining the electoral system; hence we had the proposal to ban political advertising on television and radio. The Labor Party felt that elections were becoming too expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the 1993 elections&mdash;and we have not got the final figures out, as far as I am aware, of what the political parties spent&mdash;there have been reports that the amount was significantly less than in 1990 and probably in the order of $25 million for all political parties. This program totalled $30 million, and a majority of this money was poured into Labor Party marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seat of Swan&mdash;which was won by fewer than 300 votes&mdash;a massive $617,000 was poured in. That was probably four or five times the amount the two political parties spent together in that electorate. The sports rorts program was featured prominently in Mr Beazley's election posters. In the marginal seat of Melbourne Ports, which the Labor Party was concerned about losing, well over half a million dollars was provided by Mrs Kelly to shore up the support of the local member, Mr Clyde Holding.

A category 3 application is one that the department says, among other things, lacked relevant information. Community need had not been established. That is what a category 3 application is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you that this is not just a simple program that has got out of hand and the government has indulged in a bit of pork-barrelling here and there. This has been a massive program used in the three or four months up to an election to focus substantial amounts of money into Labor Party marginal seats. That has been established, and there is no argument about that. In a typical seat, probably a political party is lucky to raise between $60,000 and $100,000. It is a general target for fund raising. In the Labor marginal seats, as Senator Hill said, these programs alone average $326,000, which is three times the amount that a political party is able to put its hands on to run the campaigns in those seats. </PARA>

There has been no public admission by the Prime Minister about the nature of this program and no recognition by Senator Evans who, I admit, went slightly further than Mr Keating. He did concede that. I accept that Senator Evans went further than Mr Keating, saying that there had been maladministration. Mr Keating said there had not been. Here we are at the heart of this government. There is no particular recognition of what has happened. In fact, we are already seeing the start of the re-writing of history, the cover-up.

Equally important, the department was about to supply a wide range of documents to the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was, finally, a refusal by the committee to allow the recall of the minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many questions which have not been answered.

She, of course, has been sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Senator Richardson decline to tighten up the guidelines for this program when he was advised by the department, as exposed on the Auditor-General's report at page 40? The reason he did not, as the architect of this program, was that he knew what a powerful weapon this program was in the run-up to an election in Labor marginal seats. Senator Richardson refused advice to tighten up the guidelines. What was the role of ALP members of parliament and candidates in the selection of these programs? This would establish what Senator Evans refuses to want to have established: was there bias in the program? Of course, that would be interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the role of Mr Ken Bennett who, as Senator Faulkner has kindly pointed out, was the senior adviser to Mrs Kelly and was formerly the chief marginal seats strategist for the ALP? What was Mr Bennett's role in this program? In 1992, $30 million was allocated for a two-year program and it was to last until 30 June 1994. The money was to be spread out and&mdash;one would presume&mdash;the projects would be carefully assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not get a two-year program. This money was spent before the 1993 election in a three-month period between November and January. This is not an ordinary program which has gone wrong; this is not pork-barrelling as it has often described; it was a major election weapon. Vast amounts of taxpayers' money were poured into marginal Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the democratic process has been rorted by what has happened. That is why we have to make this government fully accountable. Let us see whether there was bias. If there was bias in this system, it will prove conclusively how the election was stolen. Even with all the figures and statistics before Senator Evans, he cannot bring himself to agree with Senator Hill and me that this program was biased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we have seen political manipulation on a grand scale.

This is the government that is running down the resources of the Auditor-General's office as a result of a nine per cent increase every year on this terrible lease deal on Centenary House. According to all the evidence possibly available in Canberra&mdash;after a lot of work we now have every bit of evidence&mdash;the rent is 20 per cent above the market. Over the next 15 years the Auditor-General will be paying to the Australian Labor Party $15 million more than it should be because of the high rent.

As long as the Australian taxpayers are paying a fair rent and there are fair rent reviews and it is all open, accountable and transparent, I am quite happy about it. But the deal now is that $1 million a year is coming out of the resources of the Australian National Audit Office and going to the Australian Labor Party.

If we go back before that, we find that there are almost no occasions. People respected the Auditor-General's right to get information.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today having had the Auditor-General's report and the examination at the Senate estimates committee. I place on record my appreciation, as a member of this chamber, for those of our colleagues who raised these matters at the estimates hearings, where they should have been raised. After those matters were raised we had the inquiry by the House of Representatives committee and we have now had the resignation of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the considerations of the House of Representatives committee were inadequate. I note&mdash;indeed, it has been noted by everybody&mdash;that certain witnesses were not called by that committee. The decision not to call those witnesses was made by a majority of the members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question posed by Senator Hill was whether that committee faced the real challenge, which was, as Senator Hill put it, to determine whether this was a case of maladministration or whether it was a case of political corruption. It is clear that the House of Representatives committee did not determine that particular issue. It hardly even determined the maladministration issue, to be quite frank. As I said, the net result of the action taken by the parliament was the resignation of the responsible minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The irresponsible minister, says Senator Coulter. The question is whether that resignation satisfies the obligation under the Westminster system of the executive government's being accountable to the people through the parliament. Unless there are very serious proposals to the contrary, we would normally regard that as having satisfied that situation, provided the government of the day takes immediate steps to prevent such occurrences in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question in my mind, and in the minds of everyone around here, is whether any other purpose is served by requiring that responsibility on the part of the government&mdash;to be fully accountable to the public through the parliament. That is very close to our responsibilities as a Senate, to our audit and control functions&mdash;the classic Bagehot proposals for a house of review. Obviously we all take that very seriously obviously otherwise we would not be debating this matter with such intensity and giving so much consideration to it. I believe we all take seriously our functions of audit and control of executive government decisions and actions. The question now is how to make the government honest&mdash;how to back Senator Evans's discovery that this government is about good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Evans has agreed to the strengthening of the Auditor-General's role. Besides accepting the 19 or so recommendations of the Auditor-General in respect of this matter and the four or five recommendations of the House of Representatives committee, the government has stated it will redraft the Audit Act&mdash;there is now a draft in the hands of the public accounts committee&mdash;to strengthen the role and independence of the Auditor-General in line with the joint committee's report No. 296. Very important reforms were suggested in that report. I know consideration has been given to those matters by the opposition.

Who is to say that the government will not ignore these?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the government had representatives on this committee that recommended the strengthening of the Auditor-General's role, his independence and the important issue of funding to allow him sufficient funds to operate in an independent way; in other words, to be a help to the parliament and to the public in the role of auditing executive government decisions. There were government members of that committee. In fact, the chairman of the committee at the time is now a government minister. I do not want to quote back to Senator Gareth Evans some of his statements about the Auditor-General. He used to laud him; he supported very strongly the role of the Auditor-General. </PARA>

That absolutely has to stop. In my view, the recommendations of this committee should be adopted and fully implemented. It is no good the Prime Minister saying that we are standing over him to ensure that that takes place, or that in some way we are just attacking the government. No. I remind the government that some of its own members were on the committee which made this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted reports of the Auditor-General which are most critical of government actions. I know that, normally speaking, in the Auditor-General's reports there are responses by the various departments, and sometimes there is a response by the minister. In the Auditor-General's report No. 9, there is a response by the department and partly by the minister. My view is that, if the Auditor-General requests a government response to any of his reports, the government should be mandated to table in the parliament such a response. That would be a very important advance because it would require the government, as distinct from the minister, to respond and it would require it to do so within a set period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was not going to respond to the Auditor-General's report on the sports program. If that report had not been taken up by the parliament, the government would not have responded to it. But if we require the government to respond to a particular report at the request of the Auditor-General, the government ought to be required under the act to table that in both houses of parliament. Then we can pick it up; it is out in the open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only matters to do with the auditor that I have been concerned about for a considerable period of time. I have also been concerned about our audit role and, as mentioned by Senator Chamarette, the failure of the government to table documents&mdash;the sort of obfuscation that we get from the government. I have a notice of motion which was given in the parliament in December 1993&mdash;and I have discussed this with Senator Gareth Evans. That requires to be laid on the table an indexed list of every file title held by each government department grouped under classifications such as policy, legislation, advising, general matters, administration, or such other classifications as are commonly used across departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, in order for us to ask the right questions, we have to know what is going on in the various departments and, of course, sometimes we do not know. But if we get the file titles, we will at least get an indication of what is going on. That will, in my view, enhance our role as a Senate. I believe that the government is favourably considering that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said to Senator Evans that these are vital questions and vital issues for open government and for enhancing our role as a Senate. He said that he will make a statement after the votes have been taken but, as I said, the Senate votes and frequently makes decisions in general business time. The government ignores it. Let Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government, get up after the motions have been put and carried or rejected and tell the Senate that he is prepared to do what he said he would do&mdash;that is, state the government's position in respect of the Auditor-General and the other relevant matters. Irrespective of whether the amendment is carried or lost or whether the motion is carried or lost, Senator Evans must do that in order for the government to maintain&mdash;perhaps `maintain' is not the appropriate word, but I will use it&mdash;credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support Senator Kernot's amendment. I make the point that was made in Senator Kernot's opening remarks that there is no doubt that there was bias in the allocation of the sports grants. There is also no doubt that there was inadequate administration and documentation in relation to those sports grants and, of course, the story of the big whiteboard has now gone into folk history with a great deal of amusement&mdash;and, no doubt, on the part of the government, chagrin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other speakers on the opposition side have already stated that those are matters of fact. I think therein lies a considerable problem. Senator Kemp, for instance, said, `We have seen political corruption on a grand scale'. He is not in any doubt whatsoever about what the facts are. The question must therefore be asked: why does he now want to go on to further investigate this matter when he has already made up his mind? It seems to me that he, having spent almost half an hour going over the known facts, has demonstrated exactly what Senator Hill's motion is about: going over those facts in the lead-up to a number of by-elections to keep this issue alive as long as possible while there is the possibility of damaging the government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative put up by the Australian Democrats, as Senator Kernot has said, is to take a prospective look at ministerial behaviour rather than a retrospective look&mdash;not to rake over those matters which are already known, are on the record and have been established; rather, to ensure that, in the future, ministerial behaviour is above reproach.

It was an extremely difficult committee in which to take a prospective view, for precisely the same reasons that this committee proposed by Senator Hill would find it very difficult to take a prospective view. I believe it is naive of the Greens to think that politicisation of this committee will be avoided in this case. It is idealistic but is certainly not realistic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate recommends to the Working Group to Develop a Code of Conduct for Senators and Members, that it gives priority to developing a Code of Conduct for Ministers, and that the terms of such a Code of Conduct be transmitted to both Houses of Federal Parliament on or before the first day of sitting in 1993;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate calls on the Liberal Party, as a matter of urgency, to appoint a Senator to the Working Group to Develop a Code of Conduct for Senators and Members, as it was requested to do in 1991, thus allowing the Working Group to meet for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA>I could quote at some length the debate which occurred on that occasion, but I simply point out that that committee, which was first mooted in 1989, was frustrated by the failure of the Liberal Party to appoint people to it. It was further frustrated by the reticence of the Liberal Party to participate properly in it. That committee could well have developed precisely the sort of code of conduct that we are looking for here. So it is rather rich for the Liberal Party now to say that it wants to set up a committee to inquire into something.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, taking into account the matters raised during this debate, and in particular the terms of the Australian Democrats amendment which we did support and the matters raised by Senator Harradine, may I say that it is the government's intention to act as follows in relation to the accountability issues that have been central to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will act to accept the recommendations of the Auditor-General in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No 9</EMPHASIS> and the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program, and report to parliament on their implementation and applicability to similar programs by 13 May, 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Auditor-General, we will table in both houses of parliament a response, within three months, to any recommendations contained in Auditor-General's reports which require a government response. We will act to re-draft the foreshadowed legislation to update the Audit Act, to strengthen the definition of the powers and the mandate of the Auditor-General along the lines proposed in Report 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We will act to introduce, if possible, within one month, such re-drafted legislation and ensure that it is debated in both houses early in the spring session of 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will specifically consider during that re-drafting process a number of matters. First, the establishment of an independent audit committee of parliament to provide advice to the Auditor-General on the parliamentary priorities on audits and recommendations to government on the appropriation of the Australian National Audit Office; secondly, provision for the appropriation for the Audit Office to be an appropriation of parliament with the practice of cost recovery of financial statement audits from departments ceasing and the ANAO getting a comprehensive, single line budget; thirdly, the audit office being mandated as the sole auditor of all government departments, statutory authorities and GBEs without exception; and, fourthly, the Auditor-General becoming a statutory officer of the parliament and a separate statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest there be any misunderstanding, might I repeat that these are matters in respect to which we undertake to consider during the re-drafting process, and there is no magic or mystery about that. That is the basis of the agreement which was recorded in Mr Beazley's statement to the Australian Democrats. We would expect to go down most, if not all, of those paths, nonetheless, in that consideration process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in relation to the Auditor-General, I undertake on behalf of the government that we will review the forward estimates and funding for the audit office for 1994-95 following the outcome of the inquiry into the conduct of officers and departments concerned with Centenary House. We will act to request the Presiding Officers to immediately reconvene the parliamentary working group established to develop a code of conduct for ministers, members and senators and to request that committee to produce a report no later than the commencement of the spring session on 23 August, addressing the question of a ministerial code of conduct including the proper extent of ministerial discretion in disbursing funds under discretionary programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not pass the amendment so we have not got our guillotine. We will still move to bring on for debate the question of the establishment of a Senate register of pecuniary interests on 14 March, or as soon as possible thereafter. Finally, we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, motion No. 544, notice of which was given by Senator Harradine on 16 December 1993. That motion would require publication by way of tabling in parliament of departmental file titles relating to policy matters, legislation and the like. I make this statement with these specific commitments in order to put beyond any doubt the government's willingness to act in all the ways that I have stated to improve the equality of administration and accountability in this country. </PARA>

It was not until there was a police investigation that she was able to remember that the money was there and pay it back. It is very hard for most people in Western Australia to understand how anyone could possibly have $5,000 in a private bank account and not know it is there. That debate has been gone over many times in the minds of Western Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. He is so wise. If Senator Schacht had not spoken on the adjournment two nights ago I would not be speaking tonight. He said that what I raised was the most disgusting thing he had heard in 25 years. He imputed a whole load of motives to me on that night&mdash;and I did not hear any ruling under standing order 193 then. The point at issue is whether or not the then Premier, Carmen Lawrence, was aware of the contents of the petition, which went to the facts in question in a protracted case before the Family Court and the facts surrounding that petition before it was tabled. In the first instance, when the Premier was asked by the media and in questions in the Legislative Assembly about it, she said she was aware that the petition was being tabled but was not aware of the facts surrounding the petition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, in a number of statements to both the media and the Legislative Assembly, Dr Lawrence slowly but surely admitted that she had general knowledge of the facts but had been assured by Mr Halden that he had consulted the clerk of the Legislative Council and that, in so doing, the petition was all hunky-dory. We must remember that at this time the premier was under investigation by the police in relation to $5,000 in her private bank account. We must remember that it was very much in the Labor Party's interests to try to neutralise the very damaging political effect of that investigation. The investigation subsequently found that former Premier Lawrence had $5,000 in her private bank account that she had forgotten about and there was enormous motivation for the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia to find an issue to neutralise the effect of that. It was at that time that Mr Halden, now the leader, tabled that petition. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Member is not under any legal duty to present a petition, however, it is the universal rule in all Parliaments that I have ever heard of that any Member is bound to present a petition, no matter what the contents of it may be, so long as it conforms to Standing Orders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the visit was to ascertain whether or not Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd was conducting Commercial Operations while the company's Chief Pilot was subject to flight crew licence suspension by the CAA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter from the CAA to the Chief Pilot of Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd, dated 26 August 1993, stated that the Chief Pilot's Commercial and Private Pilot's Licences were suspended for the purpose of an investigation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Pilot's Commercial Pilot Licence suspension meant that he was unable to fulfil the duties of the Chief Pilot of Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd for the period of that suspension, and Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd was therefore unable to conduct Commercial Operations without the appointment of an Acting Chief Pilot approved by the CAA. As Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd had not applied to the CAA for the approval of an Acting Chief Pilot and CAA officers had received advice that Devonport Aviation Pty Ltd was continuing operations, the decision to visit the company was taken.</PARA>
